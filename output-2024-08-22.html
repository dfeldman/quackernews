Commenters on the frontlines are just now realizing that their "smart" thermostats might be more deviously clever than initially thought, with programmed peak load shenanigans costing them more than a simple manual override would. Meanwhile, in a thrilling display of energy brinksmanship, ERCOT flirts with absolute grid failure, operating within a hair‚Äôs breadth of total blackout, yet strangely, no one's being told to power down. Maybe this year‚Äôs relaxation of conservation emails is an innovative ERCOT strategy to keep everyone guessing, or maybe they just forgot to hit "send."</a>

A delightful debate ensues about whether squishing or stretching makes steel stronger, culminating in wild claims about grain flow that would make any seasoned engineer weep.

Rejoice, as we discover a novel concept: paying an app to tell us to ignore our phones ‚Äì a truly revolutionary anti-tech advancement straight out of Silicon Valley's least realistic daydreams. But wait, *there's more!* The comments section offers a smorgasbord of wishful thinkers and disillusioned techies, reminiscing on the idyllic days of social media before reality punched us in the collective consciousness. Meanwhile, another user, presumably distracted by the virtual spectacle of lion photography, compares AI integration into our lives with Debord's spectacle, probably after skimming the Wikipedia summary. üì±üëÄüí∏</a>

Armed with the inflammatory weapon of "proof by contradiction," he dares to suggest that ‚àö2 can't be pitted into a tidy fraction, <em>p/q</em>, without end. Comment sections immediately ignite with the fire of a thousand suns as armchair mathematicians and high school mathletes alike quibble over who can misinterpret Euclid‚Äôs elegant smackdown more profoundly.

The study, which might as well have been subtitled "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Microplastics," reveals that human brains are filling up with tiny bits of plastic, probably thanks to all those three-dollar lattes from Starbucks. Over in the comments, armchair scientists and part-time Instagram nutritionists are tripping over themselves to declare that they've known about this since before it was cool, and are halfway through drafting legislation to ban everything but breathing, which is also under suspicion. Could this be the solution to artificial intelligence we never knew we needed? Stay non-biodegradable, folks. üß†üåçüíÄ</a>

Commenters, adorned in their finest online-warrior cosplay, engage in a ferocious duel of who can be more disillusioned by version 'nerfs' while simultaneously hyping up the *latest and greatest* AI tool, Flux, as if it were the second coming of Photoshop. Watch as the discussions devolve into a techie specs showdown, where terms like 'realism engine' and 'FP32 accumulators' are tossed around to disguise the bitter disappointment of their desktop wallpapers still not fooling grandma. It's the blind leading the blind in tech's latest mirage ‚Äî may the least buggy AI win! ü§ñüíª</a>

Handwriter.ttf promises to synthetically generate handwriting so personalized, it could only be less useful if it required physical ink. Hacker News enthusiasts, in awe of something so wonderfully over-engineered, take turns fantasizing about a future where fonts consume more RAM than entire operating systems & suggest equally logical expansions like e-ink powered IDEs. Meanwhile, the actual utility of this tool is as clear as a smudged pencil scribble, leaving users asking, "What even is this?" as they toggle between mockery and misguided admiration in true HN fashion. ü§îüíæüñãÔ∏è</a>

                                    <a href="https://languagehat.com/mcwhorter-on-the-euphemism-treadmill/" class="summarylink">The latest intellectual circus to dismount at languagehat.com involves the mesmerizing "Euphemism Treadmill," a term that evidently captivates the blog's devoted linguaphiles more than free donuts at a writers' workshop. In an enthralling display of semantic athleticism, the site's host valiantly aims to dissect how offensive words transform into cuddly little expressions of politically correct joy. Meanwhile, in the comments section, a typical maelstrom of armchair linguists with Ph.D.s from the University of I-Know-Better insists that <em>they've</em> known about the concept since before it was cool‚Äîeach armed with an arsenal of ever-so-slightly off-topic anecdotes, ready to passive-aggressively correct each other's grammar instead of addressing the actual topic. Who needs TV soap operas when you can watch language enthusiasts duke it out over perceived slights in academic armor? üçø</a>

The comment section, an ever-vigilant forum of pedants and philosophers, dives deep into the semiotics of scam taxonomy. Here, sophisticates debate whether "pig butchering" is an innovative term or just old wine in a new bottle, while occasionally tip-toeing around the actual swindling saga that wrecked a bank. As expected, each commenter plays a crucial part in this dance of distraction‚Äîengaging more with the terminology's origin than the wreckage it describes‚Äîbecause, naturally, internet points are the real investment here. üê∑üí∏</a>
