It’s an e-book reader that promises to let you open almost every e-book format known to humankind, because why have a comfortable reading experience when you can adjust the *margins*? Commenters, embroiled in existential crises over file management, long for simplicity while simultaneously requesting features that transform a minimalist app into a Swiss Army knife. Still, others valiantly argue over the merits of library management, as if organizing fictional characters into neat, digital rows might finally bring order to their chaotic lives. 📚💻🤷</a>

Desperate nerds everywhere are exhaling in relief, thankful for yet another way to avoid social interaction by making their devices even less comprehensible to normal humans. The comment section predictably spirals into nostalgic tech mishaps, thinly veiled boasts about ancient gadget endurance, and unnecessary technical corrections that help no one. Naturally, there’s a casual tie-in to smashing tech and historical novels - because why <em>not</em> make your MacBook a $2000 Morse code machine?</a>

True to the open-source creed, the documentation assures us that every piece of *unsolicited advice* is taken seriously—except, perhaps, the suggestion to use literally any other chat service that doesn't require a CompSci degree to access. Commenters, drowning in nostalgia for the days when you had to connect to four different IRC servers just to say "Hello World", revel in proposing increasingly obscure ways to turn every possible Unix command into a chat app. Meanwhile, a lone naive soul wonders if this all might accidentally nuke their SFTP access, only to be reassured that the bespoke command might also stream movies, because of course, that's totally secure and related. 🙃</a>

The commenters, <em>excited</em> by the sheer possibility of replacing their lack of spreadsheet skills with an AI, wax lyrical about LLMs doing basic math - something we didn't realize needed fixing. Meanwhile, others express their <i>profound</i> irritation and confusion at LLMs delivering Shakespearean explanations for simple sums.

Prepare to be *awestruck* as a new arcane tool, straight from the dusty catacombs of mystical coding practices, promises to solve all your problems by *literally* doing the same thing it's done since time immemorial: binary searching. Commenters, with all the fervor of a freshman computer science seminar, dive deep into the theoretical abyss of Bayes and bisect, *mostly* managing not to drown in their own jargon. Meanwhile, someone accidentally reveals their age by bragging about an old prototype "probably still in Google's monorepo." Oh, the nostalgia! 🎩✨</a>

In 1983, Steve Jobs, heralded as a sage before his time, waxed poetic about the transformation awaiting humanity as computers moved from labs into living rooms. 🤓 Commenters, awestruck by the profundity of Jobsian predictions—evoking his near-mystical foresight—mourn the current tech-scape dominated by intrusive notifications and insidious ads. "SJ was a jerk but also a visionary!" they proclaim from their soapboxes, clutching their collector-edition iPhones and reminiscing about a simpler era when design possibly mattered more than market share. Will the real Silicon Valley please stand up, or shall we continue the sanctification of corporate narratives spun long ago? 😱🍏</a>

One keen observer points out that perhaps, just maybe, essential systems like heart attack monitors and checkout lanes shouldn't run on vibes and automatic updates.

"Can we make white?" asks one, clearly forgetting how CTRL-F works. Meanwhile, others debate pixel density benefits and manufacturing efficiencies as if squinting hard enough at their screens will turn this into the next billion-dollar breakthrough.

One might think these comments were hand-typed by Perlis himself from beyond the grave, sharing quaint little quips about "keeping the fun in computing." Meanwhile, real adults engage in dull watercooler talk about missing the "good old days" of software dev, seemingly oblivious to the fact that their pioneering tech now requires more excitement than extracting data in under a minute. Thus continues the eternal cycle of tech hype, disillusionment, and Twitter threads reminiscing about simpler times when simply owning a domain made you a neighborhood wizard. ⌨️💾👀</a>

According to an article that recounts revelations as groundbreaking as a pair of sixes, these rebels of the river might know the Nash equilibrium but scoff at it like a seasoned gambler facing a tourist. In the comments, armchair theorists bicker about "game theory optimal," revealing that they too gamble—with the terms "MDF" and "bluffing" thrown around more carelessly than chips at an amateur table. They hilariously claim expertise on a game that's less about the cards and more about psyching out your opponent until they fold from confusion or boredom. 🃏💰🤡</a>

The comment section, a delightful cesspit of confusion, has armchair experts competing for the "Most Misunderstood Point" award, with contenders flinging around phrases like "paradigm shift" and "game-changer" as if they're trying to cash them in for Bitcoins. Who knew that the key to revolutionary software development was hidden within a thicket of academic jargon and wild misinterpretations? 😂</a>

Cue the collective outrage of the open source community as they shuffle their cloaks and draft an *open letter*—because if there's anything that scares bureaucrats into submission, it's a well-formulated PDF. Meanwhile, in the comments section, keyboard warriors engage in fierce debate, some lamenting the seismic shock to the *Cyber Resilience Act*, others confusing FOSS with lost sauce recipes._uncategorized</a>
