This pint-sized Frankenstein's monster is powered by something called "Thundervolt," which seems to be just a fancy word for chopping up a Wii like a bad cooking show contestant and hoping it still works when stapled back together. Commenters are oscillating between armchair lawyering over potential Nintendo lawsuits and giving each other high-fives in a digital echo chamber that redefines 'tech support'. Suggestions that the Nintendo brand name could be *problematic* are met with the kind of dismissive snark that only true keyboard warriors can muster, proving that no one really reads the manual, or the law.</a>

As we tread through the laborious narrative cradled by a thousand dollar price tag, the comments section blooms with the tears of designers realizing their careers are less about injecting originality than following a pixel-perfect template laid down by their forebears. Our commentators wax lyrical about fundamental difference between art and design, capture quotes like trophies, and compare techno DJs to software developers in a chaotic melee of missed points and self-aggrandizement. Oh, and surprise, everyone suddenly "gets it" when pointing out that intuition in design is just a polite term for copy-paste creativity. üé®üíªüîÑ</a>

The geniuses responsible for this innovation were apparently so distracted by the shiny prospect of 14th gen supremacy that they programmed the voltage high enough to power a small sun. The comment section is awash with armchair engineers sorrowfully trading in their Intel loyalty badges for AMD's seemingly magical, unicorn-infused circuits. One insightful soul bravely admits they were just about to understand the problem until a shiny, unrelated hyperlink caught their attention and, alas, their contribution was lost to the digital ether. üçøüî•</a>

(johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com)**<br><br>In a spectacular display of intellectual fireworks, someone resurrects Shannon's all-too-familiar cocktail party anecdote about naming "entropy." Naturally, this ignites the usual circle of adoration in the comments, where von Neumann is elevated from brilliant physicist to omniscient deity‚Äîthe only entity believed to converse with toddlers and theoretical physicists on the same intellectual plane. Meanwhile, random interjections about Hungarians being aliens and the profoundly "insightful" realization that entropy might just be a tad subjective, bafflingly attempt to share the spotlight. As always, the comments oscillate wildly between hero worship and misapplied scientific concepts, ensuring that entropy remains as misunderstood as ever‚Äîvon Neumann would be proud. üôÑ</a>

Who knew? Commenters leap into the fray, armed with economics degrees from the University of Common Sense, arguing intricately about whether poker is a financially masochistic void or a thrilling roller-coaster with financial dips outweighed by psychological highs. Spoiler: it‚Äôs both, and neither; the comment section remains an echo chamber of broken dreams and misread economics textbooks. üÉèüíîüí∏</a>

Despite their valiant attempts to rope in every sci-fi concept they‚Äôve ever adored, the comment section <em>clearly</em> outpaces them in fantastical theories, arguing whether dark matter feels lonely and doesn't want to rotate with the galaxy, or if we should start treating black holes as our personal trash bins because, let's face it, planetary-scale littering wasn't enough‚Äîwe need to go cosmic. After all, what's a discussion about unobservable quasi-particles without chucking in a magnetic Planck star for good measure?

The commenters, in a tizzy of semi-related anecdotes, compete in understatement Olympics, with gems about bad chess moves and tedious Sudoku that somehow parlay into life's big lessons on strategy and mediocrity. It‚Äôs truly a spectacle of minds that perhaps think too fast or not much at all, yet spoil us with their fearless embrace of boredom draped as intellectual engagement. Each thread derails further into the abyss of utterly missing points, the perfect homage to internet commentary culture, where the only winning move is not to play.</a>

The commenters, swirling in a whirlpool of naivety, propose economic theories, conspiracy theories, and every theory in-between from their armchairs, hypothesizing the breathless political espionage saga hiding behind this year's Best Sci-Fi Naptime Story. Any takers for the next Hugo Award-Winning 'How to Spot a Fraudulent Voter' manual? Available soon at a conspiracy theory near you! üòÇüìöüöÄ</a>
