In an art project disguised as development, users on Hacker News engage in their favorite pastime: bemoaning Microsoft's lack of nostalgia-exploiting marketing while simultaneously griping about its present intrusiveness. Commenters oscillate between pining for a Clippy-driven AI future and reminiscing about when software annoyances had a friendly paperclip face. Amid groans and half-baked AI ethics, someone suggests Microsoft should mark this fusion of past irritation and future frustration with a ‚Äú<em>We told you so</em>‚Äù tagline, confirming that no one really knows what they want, least of all HN commenters.</a>

Commenters erupt in bewildered fury, shocked to discover that businesses might prefer murky pricing to keep their yachts afloat. They dive deep into the underbrush of exceptions and exclusivity deals, with the spleen and vigor of legal scholars, minus the degree. One brave soul, confused by capitalism, asks why pre-recorded performances are given a pass on honesty, forgetting that in Hollywood, fiction is always stranger ‚Äì and more profitable ‚Äì than truth. üé≠ü§ë</a>

Commentators, bedazzled by jargon like "agentic search planner," bravely defend the snail-paced search results, mistaking complexity for sophistication.

The announcement sets off a classic Hacker News parade: cheerleaders praising obsolete needs, tech hipsters lamenting the absence of macOS support, and of course, a tragic tale of collaboration gone awry. All while the developer contemplates the Herculean task of adding an auto-reconnect feature, previously spotted in realms of more arcane software like <em>tio</em>. üò±üéâ</a>

Commenters frolic in the gifts of this new shiny tool, debating the old "shell philosophy" while precariously balancing on the fine line between excitement and skepticism. As shells breed like rabbits in the Rust ecosystem, enthusiasts merrily exchange links to other contrived solutions to problems already solved decades ago.

Developers gather 'round, deploying meticulously detailed feedback in the comments like, "Ah, yes, the innovative use of arrows instead of dashes‚Äîgroundbreaking!" Meanwhile, tech enthusiasts creatively confuse tools with wizards, suggesting that amid the arrays and loops, some form of digital sorcery automagically aligns their janky diffs. Are we developing tech, or casting spells? Only the arcane arrows know.</a>

The GitHub warriors rally in the comments, tripping over themselves to thank the creator for adding Cyrillic letters and distinguishing the number "1" from a lowercase "l", as though discerning basic characters wasn't a feature of well-designed fonts since, like, ever. Someone even lamented the close resemblance between zero and uppercase "O", revealing more about the quality of their eyesight than the typeface. Meanwhile, another eager commenter, clearly a fontophile, praised the inclusion of Greek and Latin diacritics, while pitching tweaks for accents that surely five other people on earth might care about. With Old Timey Mono, step back in time and experience the joy of straining your eyes, just like your great-grandpa during his coding days on a mechanical typewriter‚Äîno electricity required! üßêüëì</a>

Keen spectators, armed with a mastery of MISSINGNO exploits rather than actual coding knowledge, flood the comments. They're ready to unleash their "groundbreaking" tweaks: implementing gravity-defying features that defy both physics <em>and</em> good taste. Meanwhile, the "unofficial" Discord channel morphs into both a bug report landfill and a bizarre tech support group where ASCII art meets existential dread. Remember - licensing is cool, but scrolling through walls of self-assured ‚Äúexpert‚Äù diatribes is cooler. üïπÔ∏èüíª</a>

Plexe - the latest attempt to jump on the automation bandwagon - promises to turn plain English into complex models with the ease of making microwave popcorn. Commenters, oscillating between naive optimism and crushing reality, are particularly jazzed about turning their copious, messy spreadsheets into sleek AI without understanding the monstrous complexity of the task. Here's to hoping Plexe can magically transform verbose documentation enthusiasts into capable machine learning engineers, because as we all know, reading a manual is exactly the same as earning a Ph.D. in Computer Science. üöÄüôÉ</a>
