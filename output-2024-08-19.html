They proudly introduce PgQueuer, a Python library that turns your database server into something that vaguely resembles RabbitMQ, but with more SQL and less efficiency. Commenters, undeterred by the overlap with existing, well-optimized solutions like Celery, dive headfirst into theological wars about the sanctity of PostgreSQL‚Äôs dual role. Because, why use the right tool for the job when you can shoehorn your favorite database into doing everything? After all, if you‚Äôve got a database, who even needs other software? üìöüíæüöú</a>

Dive into the comments and witness the tragicomedic spectacle of internet denizens losing their collective minds over something you'd usually find in a high school art class, if the teacher was particularly sadistic. One luminary suggests a photograph might have sufficed, unwittingly highlighting the redundant nature of spending thousands of hours to create something a 12-megapixel camera can accomplish in a fraction of a second. Meanwhile, another commenter trips over themselves trying to redefine 'renderings' to mask their confusion, inadvertently inventing a new art category: "Pencil-Generated Existential Despair."</a>

Today's highlight features an "eye-opening" comparison that leaves the cognitive bar so low, a digital amoeba could limbo under it. Comments swiftly devolve into a nostalgia-drenched squabble boasting their LLM flunky setups on their grandpa's basement servers. Meanwhile, someone drops a Wikipedia link, perhaps as an attempt to inject some credibility into the discourse or maybe just to help lost readers find their way back to sanity. üôÑüòÇ</a>

                                    <a href="https://www.complexsystemspodcast.com/episodes/solar-economics/" class="summarylink">In this riveting episode of "Futile Efforts with Casey Handmer," we dive headfirst into a solar energy rabbit hole that's presumably unseen by anyone but Casey and his friend from Terraform Industries. Prepare to experience the thrill of rehashed solar energy revelations posing as cutting-edge disruptors, served with a side of moral pontification on why burning more energy is actually good for polar bears, or something. Our comment section becomes a mishmash of amateur economists and weekend engineers debating the economics of synthetic hydrocarbons ‚Äì a concept so obvious, even Casey's dog probably thought of it first. If you crave a regurgitate of armchair expertise and unchallenged enthusiasm for expensive eco-alchemy, look no further; and don't forget to stick around for paychecks from our sponsors at Check, because someone's got to fund this eco-circus! üåçüöÄüí∏</a>

Our hero mysteriously transitioned through Atom because, why not follow the crowd to VSCode, only to bail (shockingly, not for Emacs) when domestic necessity reared its ugly head! Meanwhile, in the comments, developers engage in the sacred ritual of asserting their text editor's superiority, as if their choice of code-scribbling tool bestows upon them the eldritch secrets of the universe. Indeed, the great Editor War trundles on, leaving no victor ‚Äì only casualties armed with hefty config files and smug blog posts.</a>

Diving back into C programming with the fossilized Aztec C compiler, he asserts a touching yet futile resistance against modern programming conveniences. Commenters, swooning over their dusty memories, vie in an obsolete tech one-upmanship while casually lamenting the 'good-old days' of software dev, when you could code in peace without the tyranny of Agile meetings. Because clearly, nostalgia-compiling on an OS that pre-dates the internet is the hill we all want to die on in 2023. ü¶ïüíæ</a>

In a realm where Emacs reigns as the stubborn immortal, Bold Edit plays the sprightly upstart promising everything and running nowhere fast (at least not on your operating system of choice). Armchair coders revel in prophesizing its quick demise against the eternal Emacs, while others crow about <i>"unique debugging"</i> that seems as elusive as a straightforward Terms of Service.

Brushing aside the notion that "it's just HM and Algorithm W," our daring blogger takes a deep dive into dependency tracking, region containment, and probably a dozen other things that 99.9% of programmers will never need to know. Commenters quickly engage in an arms race of obscure knowledge, trying to out-pedant each other with insights about union-find trickeries and the inefficiencies of Algorithm W‚Äîit's like the Olympics, but for people who love compiler internals instead of sports. <em>Finally, rejoice</em>, as someone nearby attempts to validate their Saturday afternoon reading choice by declaring this article a "must-read" for changes to the OCaml typechecker, as though it were the hot new Netflix series everyone's guilt-binging. üçøü§ì</a>

The startup, a bastion of originality in an industry that definitely needs more job boards masquerading as tech revolutions, seeks engineers who can "design". This can only mean they've made the groundbreaking discovery that their product actually requires building. In the comments, assorted tech bros oscillate between salivating over stock options and mistaking complexity for innovation, while debating whether a ping-pong table qualifies as a "design challenge". üèìüíº</a>

Shockingly, this <em>revelation</em> is actually documented, albeit hidden in plain sight where practically no programmer has ever thought to tread: the **documentation**. In an exciting twist, the comment section quickly fills with armchair experts who apparently missed their calling as language architects, decrying or defending the noexcept semantics with the intensity usually reserved for debating tabs vs spaces. Can't wait for next week's episode where we discover that compilers do, indeed, compile code. üéâ</a>
