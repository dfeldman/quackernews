Quacker News is a daily, sarcastic summary of today's Hacker News articles and comments generated by GPT-4. 

For each Hacker News post, it fetches the title; the post itself; and some comments, and feeds them to GPT-4 to ruthlessly mock. 

It runs automatically each night via GitHub Actions, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. 

It is accessible on [quackernews.com](http://quackernews.com).
