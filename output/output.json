      "This is.. super impressive. I'd like to know how large this model is. I note that the first thing they have it do is talk to agents who can control the world gen; geez - even robots get to play video games while we work.That said; I cannot find any:- architecture explanation- code- technical details- API access informationFeels very DeepMind / 2015, and that's a bummer. I think the point of the \"we have no moat\" email has been taken to heart at Google, and they continue to be on the path of great demos, bleh product launches two years later, and no open access in the interim.That said, just knowing this is possible - world navigation based on a photo and a text description with up to a minute of held context -- is amazing, and I believe will inspire some groups out there to put out open versions.\n \nreply",
      "We already knew it's possible from AI minecraft (https://oasis.decart.ai). This is just a more impressive version of that, trained on a wider range of games and with more context frames (Oasis has about a second of context, this one a minute). Even the architecture seems to be about the same.Had they released this two months earlier it would have been incredibly impressive. Now it's still cool and inspiring, but no longer as ground breaking. It's the cooler version that doesn't come with a demo or any hope of actually trying it out.And with the things we know from Oasis's demo, the agent-training use case the post tries to sell for Genie 2 is a hard sell. Any attempt to train an agent on such a world would likely look like an AI Minecraft speedrun: generate enough misleading context frames to trick the AI into generating what you want\n \nreply",
      "This is far beyond Oasis. Oasis had approximately 0 continuity, and the generated world was a blurry mess. This on the other hand actually approaches usability.\n \nreply",
      "I don't know what the pipeline looks for these, but I assume that's due to the costs associated with training and running. Oasis had a context of only a couple of frames, while this genie model apparently runs for a couple of minutes. I guess they have a couple tricks up their sleeve to optimize this though.\n \nreply",
      "Any estimates of how much one of these cost to generate and keep a minute of context?Secondly, any estimate of how much the price could fall in 5-10 years?\n \nreply",
      "They don't give much info on parameter count, etc so it's hard to say concretely: Oasis (AI Minecraft) apparently runs on a single H100 [1], but this is presumably much larger \u2014 both due to higher fidelity, and due to the 60s context window instead of 1s context window for Oasis. But in 5-10 years regardless of what it takes to run now, the price will drop massively, and my bet is this would be playable in real-time. Context length will be solvable simply by increased VRAM (i.e. an H200 has 141GB per GPU, vs 80GB for an H100). Although Google is probably running these on TPUs, TPUs should follow a similar trajectory.In the intermediate term my guess is that this kind of world model will be useful for training 3D model generators, so that you can go from sketch -> running in-engine extremely quickly.1: https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101466/oasis-ai-and-single-nv...\n \nreply",
      "Oasis (the Minecraft world model) can serve about 5 players on 8 H100 in real-time at 20fps in 360p. This is a much more capable model with two orders of magnitude more context. They pretty much say it can't be played real-time, which I read as they generate less than 15fps@240p on 8 GPUs. Probably why they talk so much about using it for AI training and evaluation rather than human use. There is a distilled version that works in real-time, but they don't show anything from that version (which is a statement in itself).For reducing the price, ASICs like etched may be the way forwards [1]. The models will get bigger for a time, but there may be a lot of room for models that can exploit purpose-built hardware.1: https://www.etched.com\n \nreply",

      "NixOS OCI containers are a powerful way to run apps that are not packaged for Nix or NixOS. And because they\u2019re ultimately systemd units, you can customize virtually everything without having to fiddle with the container runtime.If you want to take this a step further and migrate or run a Compose project on NixOS, I maintain a tool that makes this pretty easy to do :)https://github.com/aksiksi/compose2nix\n \nreply",
      "I've used docker-compose, k8s, and NixOS myself, being from  a similar technical background as the author, but I find myself disagreeing with some of the author's opinions on the technologies. They're not wrong of course, but I've had different experiences.k8s: Installing and using k8s can indeed be a nightmare. In my job, we use Azure, so it's not so bad since launching a cluster is mostly handled by Azure. Setting it up for personal use is less fun. The mountains of YAML you can end up using to deploy even semi-complex services is even less fun. That being said, I've been wanting to use it for a personal project (distributed cluster using cloud VPSs and bare metal at home connected using WireGuard). I just wish it was smaller and faster. Most guides recommend 2Gb of RAM and 2 CPU for the smallest of small deployments.docker-compose: I actually love docker-compose for my personal stuff. I have an intel NUC hosting homeassistant, pihole, caddy, deluge, jellyfin and a handful of other stuff. Everything lives in a series of folders for each service. Backups (both data and code via git), disaster recovery, and just general reasoning about of it is so easy. The docker-compose files are small and easy to read. I also find docker-compose to be about as immutable as you'd like it - version control your docker-compose directories, pin your image SHAs, and you're in a good place. Or don't, and it will still work pretty well.NixOS: I've done it. I installed it on my Framework Laptop since it was all the rage at the t ime. I lived with it for about a year, and it was okay - for day-to-day use - AFTER I had spent weeks learning how to use NixOS. I will freely admit it's an awesome technology in some respects. But the documentation just was not there. It was way too hard to learn how to do even basic tasks. I thought nix flakes might be the \"aha\" moment I was looking for, but I gave up trying to get that to work after a couple of days of troubleshooting. Don't even get me started on trying to package up something from scratch. As a random example, I googled \"packaging python for nix\" and the top result [1] is just way too complex for something that should be pretty simple. The example includes some abomination of a .nix file with inline bash and python scripts.I don't really know where I'm going with this. I really do like the idea of NixOS. I just wish it was much, much easier to reason about. Curious to hear what others make of this.[1](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Packaging/Python)\n \nreply",
      "Nix has a dedicated following among some of the DevOps members in my company. Luckily, it stays mostly segregated, but I had an interesting conversation with some of them the other day about how awful troubleshooting Nix is. Now, mind you, these are pretty OG Nix contributors, and the response was basically: you have to want it enough.I had my own falling out with Nix/NixOS over a year ago. I guess I didn't want it enough shrug.For clarity, I still use home-manager because it's fairly painless, but anything above that is pretty much a no-go for me.\n \nreply",

      "Thanks for the perspective. I mainly use NixOS to run my server's not personal machines. I can see why it can be a frustrating experience for a machine that you just want to run personal stuff on.In my instance of creating server machines(cattle), the configurations are pretty light and what's important is the reproducibility aspect of it. If I need to take one down and rebuild another it takes about 10 minutes. All the upfront work of configuring Nix for that one machine has paid off.\n \nreply",

I set out to find the easiest way to manage multiple websites and applications on my own servers.

For example, they asked whether the kid has basic necessities, like electricity or a quiet place to study.> They also asked about factors that could destabilize the home environment \u2013 chaotic routines, parents who have disabilities, or relatives struggling with substance abuse.(So many environments nowadays, even the ones that are ostensibly created to fulfill this sort of thing, are just total failures at actually providing them.  I'm thinking of things like public libraries.  I live in Austin and have a major axe to grind about the public libraries here, which are nothing like what you'd get if you were actually interested in the pro-social goals that you'd think a public library would have in its charter.  A teenager looking to escape their high-risk environment or an adult who's had their feet knocked out from beneath them basically stands no chance at getting out of their predicament if their only option were to use the public libraries here, which would unfortunately act more like a vortex to ensure they stay in the suck.  But this is all beside the point.)I suspect but cannot prove that there's a similar link to the presentation of information\u2014that the best presentation is simple static media, ideally printed, that is supplemented by these types of exploratory environments so that you can make the main resource come to life.  Failing that, you'd want the printed presentation, sans interactivity, and then finally as a last resort, just dumping the person into these kinds of presentations.  cf Neil Postman and the widely felt phenomenon of handwritten notes being better than notes typed on a laptop.\n \nreply"

As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought. IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so forth. IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.

      "Datagrip is fantastic. You can also get the same functionality if you buy the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition, which includes many of the languages and tools that are also separately productized. I recommend this because the database tools integrate so well with the editor. For example, you can have a scratch file open that contains multiple SQL snippets. You can hit cmd-Enter when inside one snippet, and it will execute it and render the results either as a panel or inline inside the editor, notebook-style. Plus, full schema validation and autocompletion in the editor, and support for many, many databases including Postgres and ClickHouse.Not only that, but the SQL support works for embedded strings in programs written in other languages such as Go. So it knows that some statement conn.Exec(\"SELECT ...\") is SQL and syntax-highlights it, performs schema validation and autocompletion inside the string literal. Not only that, but you can open the string literal as a separate editor and edit it, including doing things like \"reformat\", which was an unexpected delight when I discovered it.It's this kind of \"feature stacking\", which features working organically with each other, that makes Jetbrains IDEs so damn good.But the basic database tools are also superb. Its table view is really fast. It has syntax highlighting (e.g. if a column value is JSON), live editing (including the ability to open a column value as an editor, in which case you get all the usual syntax tools), and even graph rendering with support for multiple data series and grouping in a single graph.There is also excellent support for exporting data. You can mark a bunch of result rows and copy them as CSV or as SQL INSERT statements, or you can save the entire result to a file. This is how I often export data from BigQuery, as it's much more convenient than Google's own tooling (the web UI is particularly bad, requiring that you export the query result to a GCS bucket first).These database UIs aren't technically difficult to do. But somehow nobody else seems capable. The closest I can think of is Microsoft's tooling around SQL Server, which is pretty slick, albeit MSSQL-specific. I often wonder how Jetbrains, which is a pretty small company, can be so effective and produce such an incredibly feature-rich product portfolio.\n \nreply",

The range does visualize min, max, and current value relative to those nicely, but it\u2019s annoying to actually use as an input more often than not.The only real exception is for  ranges of 0-100 type things, where the exact value doesn\u2019t need to be precise, just roughly somewhere on that 1-100 scale.

      "> While the hallucination problem in LLMs is inevitable [0], they can be significantly reduced...Every article on hallucinations needs to start with this fact until we've hammered that into every \"AI Engineer\"'s head. Hallucinations are not a bug\u2014they're not a different mode of operation, they're not a logic error. They're not even really a distinct kind of output.What they are is a value judgement we assign to the output of an LLM program. A \"hallucination\" is just output from an LLM-based workflow that is not fit for purpose.This means that all techniques for managing hallucinations (such as the ones described in TFA, which are good) are better understood as techniques for constraining and validating the probabilistic output of an LLM to ensure fitness for purpose\u2014it's a process of quality control, and it should be approached as such. The trouble is that we software engineers have spent so long working in an artificially deterministic world that we're not used to designing and evaluating probabilistic quality control systems for computer output.[0] They link to this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11817\n \nreply",

As a trade, we're familiar with probabilistic/non-deterministic components and how to approach them.You were closer when you used quotes around \"AI Engineer\" -- many of the loudest people involved in generative AI right now have little to no grounding in engineering at all. They aren't used to looking at their work through \"fit for purpose\" concerns, compromises, efficiency, limits, constraints, etc -- whether that work uses AI or not.The rest of us are variously either working quietly, getting drowned out, or patiently waiting for our respected colleagues-in-engineering to document, demonstrate, and mature these very promising tools for us.Everything else you said is 100% right, though.\n \nreply",

X may include \"send an email, or kick off this workflow, or add this to the log, or crash\" but you don't expect it to, for example, \"delete system32 and shut down the computer\". LLMs have essentially unconstrained outputs where the above mentioned program couldn't possibly delete anything or shut down your computer because nothing even close to that is in the code.Please do not confuse this example with agentic AI losing the plot, that's not what I'm trying to say.Edit: a better example is that when you build an autocomplete plugin for your email client, you don't expect it to also be able to play chess.

      "The term is actually fine. The problem is when it's divorced from the reality of:> in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.If you understand that, then the term \"hallucination\" makes perfect sense.Note that this in no way invalidates your point, because the term is constantly used and understood without this context. We would have avoided a lot of confusion if we had based it on the phrase \"make shit up\" and called it \"shit\" from the start. Marketing trumps accuracy again...(Also note that I am not using shit in a pejorative sense here. Making shit up is exactly what they're for, and what we want them to do. They come up with a lot of really good shit.)\n \nreply",
      "I agree with your point, but I don't think anthropomorphizing LLMs is helpful. They're statistical estimators trained by curve fitting. All generations are equally valid for the training data, objective and architecture. To me it's much clearer to think about it that way versus crude analogies to human brains.",

Similarly, there have been times when I have felt like a dope after realizing that I failed to follow up myself after a call, and am again reaching out for another reason.However, when you follow up with someone as simple as \u201cThanks for connecting me with so and so, we had a great chat\u201d or \u201cI tried that thing you suggested, here\u2019s how it worked out\u201d, you build mutual trust and enthusiasm for a successful outcome to the conversation you had. It\u2019s a genuine and thoughtful way to grow your relationship.\n \nreply",
      "Very good point.What's the old saying \"A friend in need, is a friend, indeed.\"?I like to have personal relationships, as opposed to corporate ones.Funny story: During the 1990s, my direct boss was a fairly low-key Japanese man. I really liked him. He was a marketing type, so we didn't really have a technical basis for our relationship. He was a decent chap, and I happily followed his orders. In return, he gave me a great deal of agency.After he returned to Japan, we'd run into each other, from time to time, and it was always a warm, effusive greeting.Years later, he was the Chairman of the Board of the corporation. I never leveraged the relationship, but my team was always treated well, at our level. We were a small technical team, and it would have been inappropriate to focus on us too much. I had very little ambition to go much higher up the corporate food chain, so all was fine. \nOnce, he made a visit to our office (the US branch). It was a really big deal, and people were snapping to attention all over the building.He dropped by my tiny little office, to say hi. It was really amusing, to see the puzzled expressions on all the corporate bigwigs in his entourage.\n \nreply",
      "How did you \"run into each other, from time to time\"?This seems to be the key part.  There's research that shows that relationships are built via multiple, random encounters.  Do you think he still would have dropped by your office if you hadn't had these run ins?\n \nreply",

      "This is a lot of the misunderstanding around \"networking\" you see in discussions. A lot of tech people see it as an unwelcome task/burden. Whereas, it should be generally viewed as a pleasurable opportunity to just get to know people who may (or may not) be useful at some point in the future.\n \nreply",
      "I think this happens because networking is always proposed as a way out of a bad career situation. Someone complains online about lack of opportunities then commenters come along to parrot networking as a solution. It sounds like a task you do for career gain.I have another theory that this creates a lot of rebound anger at the idea of networking. When I was doing mentoring (external to my company, people I didn't work with) I spent a depressing amount of time convincing young engineers that it was a bad idea to burn bridges as they left a company. Way too many people are enamored with the idea of ghosting their job or telling off their coworkers on the way out the door. It takes some convincing to get them to realize that leaving a bad impression on an entire office of people is the fastest way to poison their potential network. Nobody will want to refer you for future jobs if you're a jerk in your final days.\n \nreply",
      "I think the misunderstanding, in fact, is in reverse, demonstrated by the above comment. The networking required for career growth is, for many people, never going to pleasurable.My social circles don't have much overlap with, for example, startup founders. Developing personal relationships in my network is not likely to ever benefit my career growth. When people give the advice to \"network\" to enable my career growth, the people who would be most helpful tend not to have much in common with me, and building relationships with them often means not being true to myself, or even hiding myself.It isn't enough to simply build relationships or even be good at building relationships. Mostly, one needs to buy goodwill from those people who actually have power to help you.\n \nreply"

      "Bing Copilot's transcript from me asking it to ELI5. Take with a massive grain of salt, as it's an LLM etc. etc.  Me: Can you please explain this webpage like I'm five!\n  \n  Copilot: Sure! Let\u2019s break it down simply:\n  \n  The Hoare Cube: Imagine a magic cube that helps us understand how to check if computer programs work correctly or not.\n  Commands and States: Think of commands as actions and states as places. When you do an action in one place, you might end up in another place.\n  Hoare Triples: These are like rules that say, \u201cIf you start in a good place and do an action, you\u2019ll end up in another good place.\u201d\n  Flipping Switches: By changing some rules (like flipping switches), you can get different ways to check if programs are correct.\n  Three Dimensions:\n  Reach: Can you get to a place or must you get to a place?\n  Direction: Do you go forward or backward?\n  Approximation: Do you guess too much or too little about what happens?\n  The Cube: All these different ways of checking can be put together into a cube, showing how they relate to each other.\n  It\u2019s like a puzzle that helps computer scientists make sure programs do what they\u2019re supposed to do!\n  \n  Me: Explain more about the Hoare Triples for me? That bit doesn't make sense\n  Copilot: Sure! Let\u2019s break down Hoare Triples in a simple way:\n  \n  What is a Hoare Triple?\n  A Hoare Triple is a way to describe what a computer program does.\n  It looks like this: {P} C {Q}.\n  Parts of a Hoare Triple:\n  P: This is the precondition. It describes what needs to be true before the program (or command) runs.\n  C: This is the command. It\u2019s the part of the program that does something.\n  Q: This is the postcondition. It describes what should be true after the command runs.\n  Example:\n  Imagine you have a toy box (P) and you want to put a toy car in it \u00a9. After you put the toy car in the box, the box should have the toy car inside (Q).\n  In Hoare Triple terms: {Box is empty} Put toy car in box {Box has toy car}.\n  Why is it useful?\n  Hoare Triples help us make sure that programs do what we expect them to do.\n  They are like rules that tell us if we start with certain conditions and do a specific action, we will end up with the desired result.\n  Does that help clarify things?\n  \n  Me: So where do the hoare triples fit geometrically on this cube representation?\n  Copilot: Great question! Let\u2019s break it down:\n  \n  Hoare Triples: These are represented in the cube by different combinations of three dimensions:\n  Reach: Whether the states can reach (may) or must reach (must) a certain condition.\n  Direction: Whether the logic is forward (from start to end) or backward (from end to start).\n  Approximation: Whether the behavior is over-approximated (includes all possible outcomes) or under-approximated (includes only certain outcomes).\n  Cube Representation:\n  Each corner (vertex) of the cube represents a different combination of these dimensions.\n  For example, partial correctness is represented by the combination of may, forward, and over-approximate.\n  Incorrectness logic is represented by may, forward, and under-approximate.\n  Visualizing the Cube:\n  Imagine a 3D cube where each axis represents one of the dimensions (Reach, Direction, Approximation).\n  The corners of the cube show how different combinations of these dimensions form different types of Hoare Triples.\n  Equivalences:\n  Some corners are equivalent, meaning they represent the same logic but from different perspectives.\n  For instance, may+forward+over is equivalent to must+backward+over.\n  So, Hoare Triples fit into this cube by occupying different corners based on their specific combination of reach, direction, and approximation. This helps in understanding and comparing different program logics systematically!\n  \n  Me: So is \"partial correctness\" an example of a Hoare Triple? What is the 'P', 'C', and 'Q' in this case?\n  Copilot: Yes, \u201cpartial correctness\u201d is an example of a Hoare Triple. Let\u2019s break it down:\n  \n  Partial Correctness Hoare Triple:\n  {P} C {Q} means that if the precondition P is true before running the command C, and if C terminates, then the postcondition Q will be true after C finishes.\n  Components:\n  P (Precondition): The condition that must be true before the command starts. For example, if you\u2019re sorting a list, P could be \u201cthe list is not empty.\u201d\n  C (Command): The action or program being executed. In our example, C would be \u201csort the list.\u201d\n  Q (Postcondition): The condition that must be true after the command finishes, assuming it terminates. For the sorting example, Q would be \u201cthe list is sorted.\u201d\n  Example:\n  {List is not empty} Sort the list {List is sorted}.\n  In the context of the Hoare Cube, partial correctness is represented by the combination of may, forward, and over-approximate. This means:\n  \n  May: The command may reach the postcondition.\n  Forward: The logic is applied from the start to the end of the command.\n  Over-approximate: The behavior includes all possible outcomes.\n  This helps ensure that if the program starts in a good state (precondition) and runs correctly, it will end in a good state (postcondition).\n  \n  Me: So partial correctness isn't one specific hoare triple then, it's referring to a class of hoare triples that share the 'may, forward, over' properties, right?\n  Copilot: Exactly! Partial correctness refers to a class of Hoare Triples that share the properties of may, forward, and over-approximate.\n  \n  Here\u2019s a quick recap:\n  \n  May: The command may reach the postcondition.\n  Forward: The logic is applied from the start to the end of the command.\n  Over-approximate: The behavior includes all possible outcomes.\n  So, any Hoare Triple that fits these criteria is considered part of the partial correctness class. It\u2019s not just one specific triple, but rather a group of them that all follow these rules.\n  \n  Me: And I can travel between vertices of the cube by altering one of the properties I want my hoare triples to have?\n  Copilot: Yes, exactly! You can move between the vertices of the Hoare Cube by changing one of the properties (reach, direction, or approximation) of your Hoare Triples. Here\u2019s how it works:\n  \n  Reach:\n  May: The command may reach the postcondition.\n  Must: The command must reach the postcondition.\n  Direction:\n  Forward: The logic is applied from the start to the end of the command.\n  Backward: The logic is applied from the end to the start of the command.\n  Approximation:\n  Over-approximate: Includes all possible outcomes.\n  Under-approximate: Includes only certain outcomes.\n  By changing one of these properties, you move to a different vertex on the cube. For example:\n  \n  If you start with partial correctness (may, forward, over-approximate) and change the reach property from may to must, you move to total correctness (must, forward, over-approximate).\n  This way, you can explore different types of program logics and understand their relationships by navigating through the cube.\n  \n  Me: Why isn't there a point on the approximation dimension for 'no approximation'? I thought logic was an exact mathematical science?\n  Copilot: That\u2019s a great question! Let\u2019s break it down:\n  \n  Approximation in Logic:\n  In program verification, approximation helps us deal with the complexity of programs.\n  Over-approximation includes all possible behaviors, even some that might not actually happen.\n  Under-approximation includes only certain behaviors, possibly missing some that could happen.\n  Why No \u2018Exact\u2019 Point?:\n  Exact logic would mean capturing every possible behavior of a program perfectly, which is often impractical due to the complexity and undecidability of many program properties.\n  Approximations allow us to reason about programs in a manageable way, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\n  Mathematical Logic:\n  While logic is exact in mathematics, applying it to real-world programs often requires dealing with uncertainties and complexities.\n  Approximations help bridge the gap between theoretical logic and practical program verification.\n  So, the approximation dimension in the Hoare Cube reflects the practical need to simplify and manage the complexity of verifying real-world programs.\n \nreply",

      "It still boggles my mind what mental & legal gymnastics are passed through to get 3 years of funding for what looks like someone last night put together a RAG of a cbp data dump that you get for free from their site.Not saying it's not useful, just fascinated at what excuses have gone in endless meetings for 3 years to do whats basically an afternoons worth of work.Yes I mean that literally. You start off an aws rag app or a huggingface container, you download the CSVs fom cbp public portal, and you add a sh*tty backgroundcolor and a border glow that doesn't go all the way around a button. 10-15 more years of this and maybe we'll get the next dropbox again who knows.\n \nreply",
      "Honestly, if you or anyone else has a really easy way to get all communications/publications from every government/government-adjacent body, I genuinely would love to hear it. Especially at the regional/local level, cause those can be a real pain, and we'd love to save ourselves some time\n \nreply",
      "Congrats on the launch!I know it is truly the peak of the spirit of Hacker News to make the first comment a nitpick, but the fact that your name is a play on Pentagon but your logo is a hexagon causes me irrational levels of emotional distress.\n \nreply",

      "LMAO, this is unironically the kind of feedback I love to see from HN\n \nreply",
      "It's interesting to hear about the twists and turns that got you here, thanks for sharing.I happen to have built something in the same vein in a few months earlier this summer for the Gemini API developer competition.For anyone interested, check out Gov Notes (https://app.gov-notes.com)The site lets you dig into US house committee hearing videos posted to YouTube using AI search and chat. Even have some fairly powerful grounding in the chat - you can ask followups like \"when was that discussed in the video?\" and the chat will reply with a clickable link to a specific timestamp in the video where your current topic was discussed.\n \nreply",
      "Perhaps I am not using it right, I wanted to see if I could get a list of sources for \"policy roadblocks to timely court justice\" for the last 7 days in the UK.I get some interesting articles, but only really one was relevanteven then it was only tangential.Its kinda useful as a news cutting service, but its really not precise enough to replace a decent PR summary report.for housing policy It either over indexes on hansard (good source, but not for policy) or the daily mail (would have been a good source for conservative policy, but not labour.)What am I doing wrong?\n \nreply",
      "So we actually have 2 search tools. One is the one you see here, which is made to be less precise, but returns more results and returns them faster.The other sounds more like what you are looking for. It returns a more focused set of results and actually generates PR summary reports as PDFs for our customers.However, we can't really give a public demo to HN of this second one, because it takes 1-3 minutes per run and is quite computationally intensive. (And we were told that our HN launch should demo something the community can easily play around with).That being said, if you want an example of the output of this second search tool, you can see it here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sandy-suh-2ba05bb0_parsagons-...In short, I don't think you're doing anything wrong. I think you're looking for a more precise version of our product that we weren't able to provide a demo for\n \nreply",
      "Congrats on the launch! While search with LLMs is quite popular nowadays, it is still hard to get it right.As a smoke test, I tried the following queries, and they returned the same result. Good job!    international relations Turkey\n    international relations about the country with the capital city of Ankara\n\nBoth return info from this link: https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-call-with-foreign-m...\n \nreply",
      "Thank you! It's been interesting to watch HN playing around with it. This community definitely phrases its search queries differently from how many government affairs professionals would (especially to try smoke tests like yours), so I'm glad it's holding up :)\n \nreply"

      "Most of my feedback has already been mentioned by others (charging indicators, seeing what the enemy is \"thinking\", etc.). I still feel the urge to comment just to say how cool this is.The sprites being animated was definitely not something I expected. Makes the whole thing feel a lot more alive all of a sudden.I encourage everyone to also read the accompanying blog post linked in the OP. The paragraph about how I'm probably thinking that AI wrote the game for him really made me chuckle. That's exactly what I was thinking when I first read the blog title! Granted, it still would have been cool for a 9-year old, just not as cool as the alternative. So great job in immediately addressing this in the introduction. That seems like a really good use-case for AI (and I'm generally not the biggest fan of AI).The \"Dad's comments\" throughout the post are also a great way of providing some additional context without editorializing the kid's own writing.\n \nreply",
      "Kids dad here.I was not expecting animations for v1 either!   But one day he asked me what the extra buttons were in Piskel and I explained frames + layers. His eyes lit up and the flying snake was born an hour later.  Originally with 4 frames, but mom gave him feedback that he needs more frames for it to be smooth.  Thus I believe it is currently 8 frames!And we have talked in depth about how not to use AI.  He has a healthy mistrust of it because he's seen first hand how it hallucinates.v2 has sounds, which got us into a long discussion around copyrights. He's recording his own! ;)\n \nreply",
      "Dude, flying snake is my favorite. I've had a pretty bad week, and this really made my day. I miss the weird internet, with sprites and CMYK bright green. Great job.\n \nreply",
      "> I still feel the urge to comment just to say how cool this is.I will add this although it is well beyond the OP's child to fully understand... Congratulations on delivering something that people like!Cheers ^_^\n \nreply",
      "Appreciate your comments.  At this point, he definitely doesn't understand the depth of the attention his game is getting, but it will be good fuel for keeping him moving towards the next version!\n \nreply",
      "I'm sure you've gotten a lot of good feedback, but a personal message for your kid: I am well into my adulthood, but I started programming from a similar place way back when. I was probably 12-13 when I was self-studying HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Today the web tech stack is way more complicated than it was when I was a kid, but its also way more capable. You can do so much with it now that was a dream - I was into pokemon as a kid and wanted to make a \"fan site\", which is what got me learning (just to date how far back this was)!Its great you have so many tools now to learn, and your parents to ask advice. Keep it up, programming is great fun. For me as a kid it was great way to learn and explore and create in a world where I didn't have much agency.Regarding age, my buddy from college started learning to code when _he_ was 9, on BASIC, another old programming language.If I can suggest some potential learning resources for when you really want to learn more about code, checkout https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/b.... SICP was fantastic for me. If you're stuck, take it as a learning opportunity, ask for help, and keep at it. If learning a new language is too much for you, see https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/ or search google for other various attempts to port the stuff from SICP to JS world. (note to parents: if you happen to be doing this, my advice would be to set up DrRacket and install the SICP language (https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html), also feel me to email me any q's, email address in bio)\n \nreply",
      "thank you!\n \nreply",
      "Love it.In terms of constructive feedback: I would like to know when the various weapons are \"charged.\" It doesn't seem like we can tell from looking.Also it might be interesting to see what question the opponent is working on and what his answer is.\n \nreply",
      "improving clarity of the charging aspect is on his roadmap for v2 :)if you use the throwing star multiple times, it charges up other ones.  But if you use another one, then you have to charge it up again.  I believe 4 throwing stars give you the exploding star!\n \nreply",
      "We need something at the end when we win (or lose). Like a picture of a cat at least :)\n \nreply"
