      "This is a tough one. It\u2019s systemic \u2014- MS provides a \u201cbest fit\u201d code mapping from wide Unicode to ASCII, which is a known, published, \u201cvibes-based\u201d mapper. This best fit parser is used a lottt of places, and I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s required for ongoing inclusion based on how MS views backward compatibility. It\u2019s linked in by default everywhere, whether or not you know you included it.The exploits largely revolved around either speccing an unusual code point that \u201cvibes\u201d into say a slash or a hyphen or quotes. These code points are typically evaluated one way (correct full Unicode evaluation) inside a modern programming language, but when passed to shell commands or other Win32 API things are vibes-downed. Crucially this happens after you check them, since it\u2019s when you\u2019ve passed control.To quote the curl maintainer \u201ccurl is a victim\u201d here \u2014 but who is the culprit? It seems certain that curl will be used to retrieve user supplied data automatically by a server in the future. When that server mangles user input in one way for validation and another when applied to system libraries, you\u2019re going to have a problem.It seems to me like maybe the solution is to provide an opt-out of \u201cbest fit\u201d munging in the Win32 space, but I\u2019m not a Windows guy, so I speculate. At least then open source providers could just add the opt out to best practices, and deal with the many terrible problems that things like a Unicode wide variant of \u201c or \\ delivers to them.And of course even if you do that, you\u2019ll interact with officially shipped APIs and software that has not opted out.\n \nreply",
      "The opt-out is to use the unicode windows APIs (the functions ending in \"w\" instead of \"a\"). This also magically fixes all issues with paths longer than 260 characters (if you add a \"\\\\?\\\" prefix or set you manifest correctly), and has been available and recommended since Windows XP.I'm not sure why the non-unicode APIs are still so commonly used. I can't imagine it's out of a desire to support Windows 98 or Window 2000.\n \nreply",
      "As mentioned elsewhere in this discussion, 99% of the time the cause is likely the use of standard C functions (or C++ `std::string`\u2026) instead of MS's nonstandard wide versions. Which of course is a ubiquitous practice in portable command-line software like curl.\n \nreply",
      "So the culprit is still the software writer. They should have wrapped the C++ library for OS-specific behavior on Windows. Because they are publishing buggy software and calling it cross-platform.\n \nreply",
      "curl first released in 1996, shortly after Windows 95 has born and runs on numerous Windows versions even today. So, how many different versions shall be maintained? Are you going to help one of these versions?On top of that, how many new gotchas these \u201cmodern\u201d Windows functions hide, and how many fix cycles are required to polish them to the required level?\n \nreply",
      "If we're talking about curl specifically, I absolutely think they would (NOT \"should\") fix/workaround it if there are actually common problems caused by it.Yes it would have required numerous fix cycles, but curl in my mind is such a polished product and they would have bit the bullet.",

      "I think the issue is that native OS things like the windows command line, say, don\u2019t always do this. Check the results of their \u2018cd\u2019 commands with Japanese Yen characters introduced. You can see that the path descriptor somehow has updated to a directory name with Yen (or a wide backslash) in it, while the file system underneath has munged, and put them into an actual directory. It\u2019s precisely the problem that you can\u2019t control the rest of the API surface to use W that is the source of the difficulties.\n \nreply",
      "> I'm not sure why the non-unicode APIs are still so commonly used. I can't imagine it's out of a desire to support Windows 98 or Window 2000.Nowadays, it's either for historical reasons (code written back when supporting Windows 9x was important, or even code migrated from Windows 3.x), or out of a desire to support non-Windows systems.

      "Curious if anyone has tips on lead-free soldering. I basically always see in online forums \"just use lead,\" but never any tips on how to actually become capable on using lead-free solder. Esp. as my son is around a lot, it seems prudent to stay lead-free, even if you can generally handle lead safely. Thanks.\n \nreply",
      "Leaded solder is not a big health risk for hobbyists as long as you have proper fume extraction. Metallic lead is poorly absorbed through the skin (it _is_ absorbed from what I can find, but very very slowly), the major risk is from lead vapour and at normal soldering temperatures that\u2019s very minimal.However, lead free tin-silver-copper (SAC) solder is fairly easy to work with. You need a hotter soldering iron at around 300\u00b0C, and if soldering PCBs preheating the board to 80-100\u00b0C may be needed for good results. It may also take a bit longer for the solder to propagate flow and wet, since the surface needs to be hotter.If you\u2019re using additional flux or non-fluxed solder you\u2019ll need to check it for compatibility, that should be on the data sheet. Most fluxes are fine, but I\u2019ve seen a couple that say not to use with some lead free solder formulations.The main downside to SAC lead free solder is the higher temperature required which can overheat some components, particularly capacitors and ICs in my experience. It\u2019s a case of being careful to keep the heat duration as short as possible.Personally I went back to lead solder and manage my exposure with ventilation and HEPA filters.\n \nreply",
      "I've heard that the soldering temperatures aren't nearly enough to make the lead a gas and the fumes from the flux are what can kill you. I suppose the same advice applies in that case, but is that accurate?\n \nreply",
      "Yes that\u2019s accurate for hobbyist work. There will be some lead vapour, but at the temperatures used for soldering we\u2019re talking a few atoms. The flux is much more of a risk, and both are mitigated with proper fume extraction.Lead does bioaccumulate so continual exposure to low levels is dangerous, but unless you\u2019re soldering all day every day it\u2019s not likely to be dangerous.If you\u2019re a factory and have multiple wave soldering baths operating it\u2019s a different story.\n \nreply",
      "Lead has a boiling point of 1749 degrees C. That is at least 1200 degrees higher than your typical soldering temperature. If you use a propane torch you\u2019ll almost touch that temp.\n \nreply",
      "Correct, but all materials have a vapour pressure so there will be a very small amount of lead vapour when soldering. Based on lead\u2019s vapour pressure it\u2019s in the range of a few atoms, I haven\u2019t done the math though.I mentioned it for completeness because someone else would if I didn\u2019t.",
      "Quick math shows that vapor pressure of lead at 500 degrees C is  1/7,600,000 of an atmosphere.",
      "Do you know how dangerous new vs old flux is? I'm using some old  \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0444\u043e\u043b\u044c from the USSR and get headaches while soldering. Fume extraction would probably be a good idea, but I solder no more than 4h a year\n \nreply",
      "It really depends on the flux, even modern fluxes have a range of toxicity. The only way to know is to check the MSDS.I use \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0444\u043e\u043b\u044c/rosin flux as well and use a fume extractor. Rosin flux is the most common for flux-cored solder in my experience.But a few times a year is unlikely to be an issue, soldering health effects are in people who do it for work.",
      "There is a technique where you breathe out as you solder. No idea if \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0444\u043e\u043b\u044c is toxic or not but honestly if it gives you headaches why not try another type? Or wear a respirator?"

But he didn't mention that eventually if the original ARPAnet equipment was ever scrapped, the bill would also become due.When I was first at UCL in the mid 1980s until well into the 90s, all that equipment was stored disused in the mens toilets in the basement.  Eventually Peter decided someone had to do something about it, but he couldn't afford the budget to ship all this gear back to the US.  Peter always seemed to delight in finding loopholes, so he pulled some strings.  Peter was always very well connected - UCL even ran the .int and nato.int domains for a long time.  So, at some point someone from UCL drove a truck full of obsolete ARPAnet gear to some American Air Force base in East Anglia that was technically US territory.

      "Fonts are kind of dumb. There's usually nothing actually weird going on. Ligatures are simple character substitutions.

For example, when you hit a space bar, you are inserting a character which doesn't render anything because the designer didn't draw anything there. There's no extra logic.\n \nreply"

      "This is amazing.I did a similar thing for the game Highfleet, until I ran into roadblocks with the dev team.My ultimate goal was to have a \"print poster\" button that would generate the image and ship it off to one of those poster drop-shippers for a small fee. In that game, you can annotate the maps, and the world map with battle annotations is really special with lots of memories of victories and defeats. Alas, no dice.I suggest you do this for blueprints! The first thing I'm going to do is take my favorite space platforms and outposts and make posters - the colored block imagery is really artful.And, if you want a real challenge, you could parse the end-game uploads (galaxy) if available, or save files themselves.Or, slightly less ambitious - a game mod that generates links to this site directly.Very nicely done!\n \nreply",

It's often significantly better than search engines for finding the name of even an obscure work from a description, so of course folks on book-finding subreddits would use it a lot.But the author's absolutely right to warn that it also regularly fails us, and the author's also right the celebrate the folks who are trained specifically in finding this sort of information in ways that the automated tools can't replicate yet.\n \nreply",
      "I was sent a photo of a page from a book with a great piece of writing. He didn't know the book.  I ocr'd the page and pasted it into ChatGPT.  It lead me on a merry dance where it started unequivocally that it was a book it couldn't have been. It then started making up books from similar authors.  Every time I said, 'there is no such book', it appologised and then made up a new book.  It was like talking to a salesman, trying to bullshit it's way through a pitch.I put a short piece of it into Google books and it found it! I asked ChatGPT about the actual book and it claimed to know it!It was a book called Blood Knots by Luke Jennings. I bought it, and before I read it I saw the friend who sent me the excerpt, and gave it to him.  A year later I saw the same book, shelf soiled, in an independent store. It was worth the wait,  it was a great read.I also saw David Allen Green (author of the above) ask his question on Bluesky on my first day using it. Somehow I feel part of this story\n \nreply",
      "They were also pointing out an interesting point that ChatGPT does.  It treats everything as relevant.  Whereas the librarian who found the book.  Systematically discarded possible 'facts' and substituted others (goblins->demons) to find out what was going on.  Not sure any AI does this currently.\n \nreply",
      "ChatGPT does do that for me, when I'm using it for tasks like David Allen Green's book hunt.This has yet to help. If it can find it, it (so far) has not needed to change the details I provided; if it doesn't know, it will change them to something thematically similar but still not find what I wanted (and if I insist on requiring certain story elements that it had changed, it will say something along the lines of \"no results found\" but with more flowery language).\n \nreply",
      "I suspect that, given a reasonable prompt, it would absolutely discard certain phrases or concepts for others. I think it may find it difficult to cross check and synthesize, but \"term families\" are sort of a core idea of using multi-dimensional embedding. Related terms have low square distances in embeddings. I'm not super well versed on LLMs but I do believe this would be represented in the models.\n \nreply",
      "I think a more robust approach would be to restrict the generative AI to generating summaries of book texts. First summarize every book (this only has to be done once), and then use vector search to find the most similar summaries to the provided summary. Small mistakes will make little difference, e.g. \"goblin\" will have a similar embedding to \"demon\", and even entirely wrong information will only increase the number of books that have to be manually checked. Or better yet, develop an embedding model that can handle whole books at once and compare the vectors directly.Perhaps somebody with more compute than they know what to do with could try this with Project Gutenberg as a proof of concept.\n \nreply",
      "It's also interesting that years of trying on Twitter and Reddit failed, but asking on Bluesky succeeded.  I'm certainly not claiming that Bluesky is some kind of great leap forward compared to Twitter.  But it could be that being a new service it just isn't as crowded with bots, spam, and BS -- thus allowing the signal to come through.\n \nreply",

      "This is excellent!I think the utility of generating vectors is far, far greater than all the raster generation that's been a big focus thus far (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc). Those efforts have been incredibly impressive, of course, but raster outputs are so much more difficult to work with. You're forced to \"upscale\" or \"inpaint\" the rasters using subsequent generative AI calls to actually iterate towards something useful.By contrast, generated vectors are inherently scalable and easy to edit. These outputs in particular seem to be low-complexity, with each shape composed of as few points as possible. This is a boon for \"human-in-the-loop\" editing experiences.When it comes to generative visuals, creating simplified representations is much harder (and, IMO, more valuable) than creating highly intricate, messy representations.\n \nreply",

      "For a number of years it was (non-officially) thought to be a feature to use weak DKIM keys.

(I\u2019m not saying that this is why most companies used short keys, just that there was a general view that short keys were not all bad.)DKIM deniability is a particular hobbyhorse of mine [1]. These short keys are obviously not the way to achieve it, but I view this kind of thing as a result of the muddled thinking that\u2019s been associated with DKIM and the community\u2019s lack of desire to commit to the implications of an all-email signing mechanism.[1] https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/11/16/ok-googl...\n \nreply",

This finding was unexpected, as RSA keys shorter than 1,024 bits are considered insecure, and their use in DKIM has been deprecated since the introduction of RFC 8301 in 2018.Driven by curiosity, we decided to explore whether we could crack one of these keys. Our goal was to extract the private key from a public RSA key, enabling us to sign emails as if we were the original sender. We were also curious to see whether emails signed with this compromised key would pass the DKIM verification checks of major email providers like Gmail, Outlook.com, and Yahoo Mail, or if they would outright refuse to verify a signature generated with such a short key.For our experiment, we chose redfin.com after discovering a 512-bit RSA public key at key1._domainkey.redfin.com (now no longer available):The public key, located in "
