      "About \"people still thinking LLMs are quite useless\", I still believe that the problem is that most people are exposed to ChatGPT 4o that at this point for my use case (programming / design partner) is basically a useless toy. And I guess that in tech many folks try LLMs for the same use cases. Try Claude Sonnet 3.5 (not Haiku!) and tell me if, while still flawed, is not helpful.But there is more: a key thing with LLMs is that their ability to help, as a tool, changes vastly based on your communication ability. The prompt is the king to make those models 10x better than they are with the lazy one-liner question. Drop your files in the context window; ask very precise questions explaining the background. They work great to explore what is at the borders of your knowledge. They are also great at doing boring tasks for which you can provide perfect guidance (but that still would take you hours). The best LLMs (in my case just Claude Sonnet 3.5, I must admit) out there are able to accelerate you.\n \nreply",
      "I'm surprised at the description that it's \"useless\" as a programming / design partner. Even if it doesn't make \"elegant\" code (whatever that means), it's the difference between an app existing at all, or not.I built and shipped a Swift app to the App Store, currently generating $10,200 in MRR, exclusively using LLMs.I wouldn't describe myself as a programmer, and didn't plan to ever build an app, mostly because in the attempts I made, I'd get stuck and couldn't google my way out.LLMs are the great un-stickers.

      "Quick example. I was implementing dot product between two quantized vectors that have two different min/max quantization ranges (later I changed the implementation to just centered range quantization, thanks to Claude and what I'm writing in this comment). I wanted to still have the math with the integers and adjust for the ranges at the end. Claude was able to mathematically scompose the operations as multiplication and accumulation of a sum of integers and later adjust the result, using a math trick that I didn't know but was understandable after having seen it. This way I was able to benchmark this implementation understanding that my old centered quantization was not less precise in practice and faster (I can multiply integers without taking the sum, and later fix for the square of the range factor). I'd do it without LLMs but probably I would not try at all because of the time needed.Other examples: Claude was able multiple times to spot bugs in my C code, when I asked for a code review. All bugs I would eventually find but that it's better to fix ASAP.Finally sometimes I put relevant papers and implementations and ask for variations of a given algoritm among the paper and the implementations around, to gain insights about what people do in the practice. Then engage in discussions about how to improve it. It is never able to come up with novel ideas but is able to recognize often times when my idea is flawed or if it seems sounding.All this and more helps me to deliver better code. I can venture in things I otherwise would not do for lack of time.\n \nreply",

      "It\u2019s been more than a decade since I worked in games, but for my entire games career, any and all use of C++ exceptions was strictly disallowed due to other horror stories. I was still bit in a very similar way by someone\u2019s C++ copy constructor trickery - a crash that only happened in a release build after playing the game for a while, with a stack corruption. Like the author, for me this was one of the hardest bugs I ever had to track down, and I ended up writing a tiny release mode debugger that logged call stacks in order to do it. Once I was able to catch the corruption (after several days of debugging during a crunch weekend), someone on my team noticed the stomp values looked like floating point numbers, and pretty quickly we figured out it was coming from the matrix class trying to be too clever with it\u2019s reference counting IIRC. There\u2019d been a team of around a dozen people trying to track this down during overtime, so it suddenly hit me once we fixed it that someone\u2019s cute idea that took maybe 10 seconds to write cost several tens of thousands of dollars to fix.\n \nreply",

Do you see now why maybe clever code isn\u2019t a good idea?Cortisol actually reduces the effectiveness of working memory.

Probability x consequences.\n \nreply",
      "This could still happen without exceptions though, right? The flow is more explicit without exceptions, but returning an error code up the stack would have the same effect of causing the memory that select() is referencing to possibly be used for a different purpose when it writes its result.\n \nreply",
      "My reading is that the problem was specifically that they were injecting an exception to recover control from the C library back to their code.It seems like the select() was within its rights to have passed a stack allocated buffer to be written asynchronously by the kernel since it, presumably, knew it couldn't encounter any exceptions.  But injecting one has broken that assumption.If the select() implementation had returned normally with an error or was expecting then I'd assume this wouldn't have happened.\n \nreply",

This is a little bit like the Win32 analogue of POSIX signal handlers and EINTR, I suppose.\n \nreply",

      "It feels like problem with these aren't the ideas, rather the \"let's just\" approach/expectation in front of them.For instance \"Let's just add an API.\" I think the approach to an API as \"just\" a feature to your product will be about as successful as saying \"let's just add a UI\". To implement a successful UI one needs to be thoughtful, thorough, and bring in people who specialize in it. Why should any other interface for your product be any different? It's not that it's a bad, or good, idea, rather one that shouldn't \"just\" be done.\n \nreply",

Although I guess the management might not have liked that essentially I could choose what got done and what I got to work on just by running my big mouth.facetiousness aside, I'm trying to point out that most often when people say \"let's just\" it is because they are advocating a course of action and that rule won't work unless the course they are advocating gets chosen.

The whole reason the data is valuable is for account takeover and identity theft because identity verification uses publicly available information (largely publicly available, or at least discoverable, even without breaches).  But no one wants to put in the effort to do appropriate identity verification, and consumers don't want to be bothered to jump through stricter identity verification process hoops and delays---they'll just go to a competitor who isn't as strict.So we could make the PII less valuable by not using for things that attract fraudsters.\n \nreply",

Even though people often think I'm joking, almost always the backend database was a Google Sheet. Google Sheets has great API support, easy to write functionality, convenient read and file dumps, works well with Pandas/SQL, and has a universally appreciated UX. Data validation can be annoying if the \"admin\" directly enters data, but for building a proof of concept, nothing beats Google Sheets. The data from Google Sheets would be passed through an API to a web UI/dashboard. The dashboard I built for end users was a simple Bootstrap (Vue-Bootstrap) table from the API, with enough easy-to-use filters and views to work out of the box. If the data was too large, I would use a templated snippet to convert the JSON into a card view. Ignoring long-term maintainability, this was one of the most foolproof ways to build dashboards. After that, I'd slap Firebase Auth on top, and that was it.I haven't worked on these types of projects for nearly two years now.

      "I\u2018m ingesting data from my local weather service into Prometheus and display it in grafana, and what I find most interesting is how the forecast for a certain day changes over time, e.g. seeing how many changes happen until the service lands on the actual precipitation probability for the next hour, as well as correlations between changes across days - something most APIs don\u2019t provide by default but once you feed them into Prometheus you get the historic changes easily.\n \nreply",
      "Very happy to see Grafana adopt this plugin to continue it's development among all the various other data sources grafana can plugin in to. I'm happy to bring Grafana and it's stack to the work place and developers are very happy using it with their OpenTelemetry integrations. Their only complaint is that some of the settings for panels can be difficult to find.My own wish is that I hope something like this https://github.com/knightss27/grafana-network-weathermap is adopted too. I know it maybe possible using Canvas but Canvas is too much of a blank slate and needs a lot of work to set it up the same way.\n \nreply",

      "I did this a few years ago (sans plugin) and correlated weather to velocity and WIP (Jira) for our development team. I was disappointed to find no meaningful correlation.\n \nreply",
      "Years ago I worked on a live TV show that allowed viewers to call and ask questions to hosts. It was a small local TV station but the show was some what popular. We wanted to know what variables affected how many calls there are per show and we manually tracked a bunch of data points and one of them was the weather. Once enough data was collected it was very clear for our show the weather had a big impact, when we had beautiful weather we had less calls but when the weather was horrible we had a lot more calls. In hindsight it was obvious that when it rains people will stay home and watch TV.Another fun thing this data collecting showed me was subjective bias of certain managers. One of them was sure that a certain hosts were getting much less calls than the others during the show but the data showed that besides one \"star\" all the hosts have about the same amount of calls even though it \"felt\" like they got less.\n \nreply",

      "> fees, latency, slippageWhenever I trade, I somehow always get an adverse price. I figure it's the \"no fee\" brokerage chiseling a bit off for themselves.

      "\"Free\" transactions are free because they're not immediate. The broker buys the share themselves and sells it to you at markup... ie: there is still a transaction fee, you just have no idea what it is.Day traders use platforms that are optimized for speed and minimal fees, and that don't charge fees based on lot size.\n \nreply",
      "What your suggestions is front running. This is illegal for stocks and most assets (not FX!). This will get a broker in hot water.The more nuanced practice that brokers use to monetize is payment for order flow. They sell your security order flow to algorithmic trading shops that buy and sell the securities you want to trade.You\u2019re correct in that most retail orders never make it to a regulated exchange, but that may not always be a bad thing.

      "3D printing doesn't relieve any important construction constraints and probably raises costs because unfamiliarity increases risks and increased risk increases price.Superstructure is about the easiest and fastest part of residential construction. Sitework, finishes, and MEP systems are harder, tend to take longer, and cost more.Anyway, market rate housing sells at market rates no matter how it is built.\n \nreply",

      "> This is true. Do you see any opportunity for efficiencies in rebuilds?When this technology has become much more established, the \"risk premium\" can be decreased by a lot. Then one can start to find methods to make the process more economic. And I see quite some potential there, because 3D printing can potentially be done in a much more \"automatic\" way than other existing house building processes.\n \nreply",
      "What do you mean by \u201cefficiencies?\u201d\n \nreply",
      "Like you mentioned the market for housing is more about where people want to live, and the actual building on it is less important (up to first order quality and space), so that optimizing construction costs doesn\u2019t really save money on housing.But suppose we have a country of aging housing. Could prefabrication techniques result in lower costs when replacing existing buildings without a land transfer?\n \nreply",
      "1. In successful businesses, lower costs usually correlate to greater profits not lower prices. This is particularly the case with the narrow section of the real-estate market that is single family housing (single family housing is about the lowest and worst use of real-estate (i.e. the opposite of highest and best use)).2. Single family home construction in the US is highly prefabricated. You can go into any Home Depot and get lumber, fasteners, fixtures, appliances, and anything else you need to build a house. All of it movable and installable without much mechanization beyond a truck (and Home Depot will rent you one of those).3. Tearing down existing houses for replacement only makes economic sense in two cases. The first is when the value of the land justifies more expensive construction (e.g. MacMansions). The second is when redevelopment is not for the market (e.g. Habitat for Humanity).4. It is a mistake to look at construction as inefficient. Construction is just one component of real-estate markets.5. We have very efficient prefabricated housing. It tends to look like mobile homes.6. Wealth preservation is the primary function of the real-estate industry. Buying and selling for profit is the low end. The real money in real-estate resides in income producing property not single family houses.\n \nreply",
