      "As a user of npm-hosted packages in my own projects, I'm not really sure what to do to protect myself.  It's not feasible for me to audit every single one of my dependencies, and every one of my dependencies' dependencies, and so on.  Even if I had the time to do that, I'm not a typescript/javascript expert, and I'm certain there are a lot of obfuscated things that an attacker could do that I wouldn't realize was embedded malware.One thing I was thinking of was sort of a \"delayed\" mode to updating my own dependencies.  The idea is that when I want to update my dependencies, instead of updating to the absolute latest version available of everything, it updates to versions that were released no more than some configurable amount of time ago.  As a maintainer, I could decide that a package that's been out in the wild for at least 6 weeks is less likely to have unnoticed malware in it than one that was released just yesterday.Obviously this is not a perfect fix, as there's no guarantee that the delay time I specify is enough for any particular package.  And I'd want the tool to present me with options sometimes: e.g. if my current version of a dep has a vulnerability, and the fix for it came out a few days ago, I might choose to update to it (better eliminate the known vulnerability than refuse to update for fear of an unknown one) rather than wait until it's older than my threshold.reply",
      "> It's not feasible for me to audit every single one of my dependencies, and every one of my dependencies' dependenciesI think this is a good argument for reducing your dependency count as much as possible, and keeping them to well-known and trustworthy (security-wise) creators.\"Not-invented-here\" syndrome is counterproductive if you can trust all authors, but in an uncontrolled or unaudited ecosystem it's actually pretty sensible.reply",
      "Have we all forgotten the left-pad incident?This is an eco system that has taken code reuse to the (unreasonable) extreme.When JS was becoming popular, I\u2019m pretty sure every dev cocked an eyebrow at the dependency system and wondered how it\u2019d be attacked.reply",
      "> This is an eco system that has taken code reuse to the (unreasonable) extreme.Not even that actually. Actually the wheel is reinvented over and over again in this exact ecosystem. Many packages are low quality, and not even suitable to be reused much.reply",
      "The perfect storm of on the one side junior developers who are afraid of writing even trivial code and are glad if there's a package implementing functionality that can be done in a one-liner, and on the other side (often junior) developers who want to prove themselves and think the best way to do that is to publish a successful npm packagereply",
      "> I think this is a good argument for reducing your dependency count as much as possible, and keeping them to well-known and trustworthy (security-wise) creators.I wonder to which extent is the extreme dependency count a symptom of a standard library that is too minimalistic for the ecosystem's needs.Perhaps this issue could be addressed by a \"version set\" approach to bundling stable npm packages.reply",
      "If it's not feasible to audit every single dependency, it's probably even less feasible to rewrite every single dependency from scratch. Avoiding that duplicated work is precisely why we import dependencies in the first place.reply",
      "> If it's not feasible to audit every single dependency, it's probably even less feasible to rewrite every single dependency from scratch.There is no need to rewrite dependencies. Sometimes it just so happens that a project can live without outputting fancy colorful text to stdout, or doesn't need to spread transitive dependencies on debug utilities. Perhaps these concerns should be a part of the standard library, perhaps these concerns are useless.And don't get me started on bullshit polyfill packages. That's an attack vector waiting to be exploited.reply",
      "Most dependencies do much more than we need from them. Often it means we only need one or a few functions from them. This means one doesn't need to rewrite whole dependencies usually. Don't use dependencies for things you can trivially write yourself, and use them for cases where it would be too much work to write yourself.reply",
      "A brief but important point is that this primarily holds true in the context of rewriting/vendoring utilities yourself, not when discussing importing small vs. large dependencies.Just because dependencies do a lot more than you need, doesn't mean you should automatically reach for the smallest dependency that fits your needs.If you need 5 of the dozens of Lodash functions, for instance, it might be best to just install Lodash and let your build step shake out any unused code, rather than importing 5 new dependencies, each with far fewer eyes and release-management best practices than the Lodash maintainers have.reply"

The popular @ctrl/tinycolor package, which receives over 2 million weekly downloads, has been compromised along with more than 40 other packages across multiple maintainers. This attack demonstrates a concerning evolution in supply chain threats - the malware includes a self-propagating mechanism that automatically infects downstream packages, creating a cascading compromise across the ecosystem. The compromised versions have been removed from npm.In this post, we'll dive deep into the payload's mechanics, including deobfuscated code snippets, API call traces, and diagrams to illustrate the attack chain.

One Medical told me that it would be a $400/shot 3-shot regimen. I'll probably just travel to India some time to visit family and get Cervavac there instead of Gardasil here. It's about $20/shot.reply",
      "Depending on the state you\u2019re in, you likely have to get a prescription from a doctor, not a pharmacist, due to the wording of the law.Simplest route would be to call your primary doctor and ask if they can give it to you at your next annual checkup.reply",

      "This is mostly guesswork but I think you need to get the vaccine before you catch it and lots of people have it as they get older.If you have a limited supply the greater bang per buck would be to start with the young people who almost certainly haven't caught it yet and then work your way up.reply",
      "It's less that and more \"we just haven't tested it in older populations yet\".Sure you are more likely to have it the older you are but even then you are unlikely to have all the strains. The vaccine covers like 9 or 10 different strains so it can protect you from the other strains even if you already have one of them.It's generally only when you get into the 60s and up that the justification for not recommending the vaccine changes. Once you get into those later years the immune response changes a bit and you get new concerns.An example being herpes zoster (chickenpox) where after a certain age you are recommended to get the shingles vaccine instead of the chickenpox vaccine since the way the disease presents and how the body reacts to it changes with age (technically shingles can happen at any age but generally herpes zoster presents as shingles instead of chickenpox the older you get).reply",
      "> Why is there an age limit on an all encompassing vaxVaccines are subject to stringent safety standards since they\u2019re administered to healthy people. The age limit may suggest that at the time of the recommendation, in the relevant jurisdiction, the manufacturer had not studied its safety and efficacy in >40 year olds.(I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s an age limit as much as the upper end of a recommendation.)reply",
      "E.g., the Shingles vaccine simply hasn't been tested in <50 populations.  But if you're under 50 and you've had the chicken pox, you should ask your PCP to prescribe the shingles vaccine off-label and go get it, because shingles sucks and the vaccine definitely works.reply"

      "I'm split with this. If it helps other people, then I'm all for it. But speaking as someone who is legally blind and makes extensive use of these settings, Windows 10 accessibility drives me mad. I'm waiting for fractional scaling to improve for Linux so I can make the switch.The problem with Make text bigger and Make everything bigger is they apply to every single application that supports them. Let's say I have two applications: A is comfortable enough to see and B isn't. If I change either of these settings to help me use B, A could now be a problem because it can take up too much screen real estate, which makes it unusable for a different reason.This doesn't sound like much of a problem until you have 5 or more applications you're trying to balance via these two settings. In reality, it's more complex than I'm describing because I may need to change both settings to help with a new application, which then means I have to continuously test every other application I use to make sure they're all somewhat comfortable enough to use.If an application I use updates to include support for these settings, I have to go through all this unplanned work again to try and make everything usable once more. It's frustrating.I know people make fun of Electron, but one major plus point for me is I have per application scaling when using it, and so it gives me better accessibility than Windows does by far.> (Failing that, adding basic support for scaling text or UI via ctrl+plus/minus would be a huge improvement!)I'd consider this to be a better option.reply",
      "Try Fedora with KDE. It has fractional scaling, per display.I set my laptop (1920x1080) to 120%, effectively making it 1600x900 but with very good physical size of things. I set my external panel (2560x1440) to 160%, effectively making it 1600x900 also. KDE even visualizes the two panels to be the same size. Ontop of these basic DPI settings, you can then tweak font/text even further. Its quite amazing. Windows cannot do custom dpi per monitor, only a single custom dpi that gets applied to all monitors.If you do go down the fractional scaling rabit hole, make sure whatever values you pick, both the height and width ends without any fractions after applying your custom dpi... that elimnates all blurs. In my example above, 2560/1.6 and 1440/1.6 gives nice round numbers, even though the operating systems typically only offer 100/125/150/175/200 etc.I built a small console app for myself that takes the resolution and tests all increments of 1% to see which resolution combinations gives values that don't end with fractions at the end. So it tells me which effective resolutions I will get at which % settings. Its awesome and made it so that I can easily make so that my laptop and external display has the same amount of space (or line of code) on the screen, even though they are different physical sizes.reply",
      "Thanks for detailed response. Do you happen to know if this is a recent change in Fedora/KDE? I tried somewhat recently, although I can't remember quite when that was. Gnome had experimental support for fractional scaling at the time but it wasn't good enough to switch to.> Windows cannot do custom dpi per monitor, only a single custom dpi that gets applied to all monitors.Yeah, support for custom DPI in general isn't great.

I'll give it another go, thanks BatteryMountain!reply",
      "As a word of warning, it is still not 100% perfect. I've noticed that on my laptop, when the Zed editor is maximized, there is a tiny gap between it and the panel at the bottom. I think this happens when an app, even if it supports fractional scaling in general, can't handle a logical window size that is not a whole number. To be fair, this is one of the only apps I've really had any scaling issues with lately, and it is just a minor visual annoyance. The Linux DPI scaling story is finally pretty solid.Also, many apps (including Electron/Chromium apps) will still run under XWayland when using a Wayland session by default, because there are still a handful of small issues and omissions in their Wayland drivers. (It's pretty minor for Electron/Chromium so you can opt to force it to use native Wayland if you want.) In case of XWayland apps, you'll have to choose between allowing X11 apps to scale themselves (like the old days) or having the compositor scale them (the scaling will be right, even across displays, but it will appear blurry at scales higher than 1x.) I still recommend the Wayland session overall; it gives a much more solid scaling experience, especially with multiple monitors.reply",

In Wayland sessions, you can ensure that applications always appear at the correct size, though at the cost of \"legacy\" applications appearing blurry. This behavior is configured in the Display Settings in KDE Plasma.Also possibly useful: if you like the KDE Plasma session, it has a built-in magnifier; just hold Ctrl+Meta and use the scroll wheel.reply",

      "I know nothing about this, however, today's codes are not the same as yesterday's codes. From what I understand, plenty of very tall housing blocks were built for factory workers and their families, which now get retrofitted with an elevator, or, as we say in the UK, a lift.This enables people to stay in their own homes in old age. The lift is external to the building, making it relatively easy to install. The balconies, presumably built for mostly clothes-drying purposes in ye-olden-days, provide the access.I don't know if this goes to 10-20 storeys, I am just chiming in because, yes, there were many high rise buildings without lifts and our ever-inventive Chinese friends have worked out a solution.In sunny Scotland we have what non-Scottish people call 'apartment blocks' (closes) and some of these go up six storeys with no lifts. Moving house into one of these is fun, as you can imagine. You can get your steps in carrying 25Kg+ for half of your steps, to feel like you have just completed some type of marathon. On the positive side, you are unlikely to be robbed of everything, once you have moved in.As for fire, this means lots of doors.

These doors make the effort truly Herculean since you can't wedge them all open.More generally, what amazes me about lifts in the UK is that there is a general lack of redundancy. Recently I had to go across the country by train with a bicycle and two massive rucksacks full of stuff. There were four connecting trains I needed to get. This would have been 'easy enough' if the lifts had been working. They were not working. Had there been two lifts per station then one could be out for maintenance, but no.reply",

      "Literally got something similar to this last Friday. Sounded legit. My one weird trick that works every time - give me a ticket # and an official phone number to call back to and I can confirm the phone number is legit. This way you can continue the conversation if it is actually legit, and if it's not legit then all good.The guy who called me said \"I can send you an email to show it's official\" and I thought of that immediately when I read this article. No dice, he refused to give me a number to call back on, so I knew it was fake.EDIT You can spoof from email addresses and you can spoof phone numbers - if someone is calling from a legit number on caller id it means NOTHING. You have to call back to a legit number to be sure it's real.reply",

      "I've lived through the recessions of 1990-91 (in my 20s, not tech), the Dotcom bust and the Great Financial Crisis.  I can tell you that it's always been this way when its' a \"buyer's market\" and the employers can afford to be picky.  I can also tell you that this is not some game-changing phenomenon[0].  The jobs will return when it is once again a \"seller's market\" -- which it surely will be.  This applies to non-tech job markets as well.During the DotCom bust I ended up getting a taxi license in NYC and driving yellow taxicabs on 12-hour (standard) shifts for over 18 months.  During the GFC, I got trained in HazMat handling and joined contracting companies as an employee cleaning the beaches after the BP oil spill for a year.  In both cases, I re-entered the software engineering market as a high-demand candidate and made even more in base and total comp than I had previously.I am over 50 now.  I never transitioned to a management position.  Still, I do plan to re-enter the software engineering market when the current winter ends and spring next arrives.[0] I work with agentic AI on my own projects.  Due to limited context windows, even the best models like Claude Opus or Alibaba's Qwen-coder require much more expert handholding than people let on.  Even with good context engineering and memory tools.reply",
      "What could potentially put an end to the current hiring \"winter\"?We have an increasing amount of immigrants coming over in hopes of getting a white-collar job, in combination with the tech sector shrinking, as well as companies as a whole being much more careful when hiring.There would need to be some explosion in the amount of tech jobs, in order for everyone to be able to get one. However, I just cannot see what could cause something like this in the near future.reply",
      "As someone who's recently been hiring (sorry folks, position was filled just a few days ago), it's wild to me how distorted things have become.We had 1200 applications for an extremely niche role.  A huge amount were clearly faked resumes that far too closely matched the job description to be realistic.  Another huge portion were just unqualified.The irony is that there actually _are_ a ton of exceptionally qualified candidates right now due to the various layoffs at government labs.  We actually _do_ want folks with an academic research background. I am quite certain that the applicant pool contained a lot of those folks and others that we really wanted to interview.However, in practice, we couldn't find folks we didn't already know because various keyword-focused searches and AI filtering tend to filter out the most qualified candidates.  We got a ton of spam applications, so we couldn't manually filter.  The filtering HR does doesn't help.  All of the various attempts to meaningfully review the full candidate pool in the time we had just failed. (Edit: \"Just failed\" is a bit unfair. There was a lot of effort put in and some good folks found that way, but certainly not every resume was actually reviewed.)What finally happened is that we mostly interviewed the candidates we knew about through other channels.  E.g. folks who had applied before and e-mailed one of us they were applying again. Former co-workers from other companies.  Folks we knew through professional networks. That was a great pool of applicants, but I am certain we missed a ton of exceptional folks whose applications no actual person even saw.The process is so broken right now that we're 100% back to nepotism.  If you don't already know someone working at the company, your resume will probably never be seen.I really feel hiring is in a much worse state than it was about 5 years ago.  I don't know how to fix it.  We're just back to what it was 20+ years ago. It's 100% who you know.reply",
      "> The process is so broken right now that we're 100% back to nepotismJust want to comment on this, because I think think favoring unknown candidates is a mistake we make too often, and in fact the \"normal\" process is a disaster on both sides for this reason. Nepotism or Cronyism is granting resources, patronage, jobs to someone you know instead of a qualified candidate. In many industries this is how they function because qualifications and skill provide little to no differentiation (Think knowing Microsoft word and having a comms degree with no work experience).In high skill industries where experience is hard fought... people know the who the \"people\" are because they stick out like sore thumbs. If your hiring process at work is throw up a job on indeed and see what resumes come through, your company likely isn't worth working at anyway because the best candidates aren't randos.Think of it this way if you were putting together the Manhattan project again would you recruit the people with a stellar reputation in physics, engineering, manufacturing, etc OR would you throw up a job on a job board or your corporate site and see what comes back? The difference is active vs passive, good reputation vs no reputation (or a bad reputation).Not trying to make a big semantic argument... I just want to say that things like reputation and network matter... and thats not really \"nepotism\"reply",
      "I must be missing something. 1200 real applications are hard to sort through. 1200 mostly fake applications are much easier. Hiring is a high-leverage activity, and it's absolutely worth spending a couple hours going through those by hand.reply",
      "For 1200 applications, a couple hours translates to less than 10 seconds per application.  In the age of LLMs, why do you think you'd be able to discern whether an application was fake in 10 seconds?  Remember, it's not \"obviously fake\", it's \"designed to con you\" fake.reply",
      "Would you have found it reasonable for interested candidates to have reached out directly instead of just submitting a resume to the ATS? With the AI spam etc. it feels like the usefulness of these automated systems is quickly diminishing. Hiring feels broken right now.reply",
      "What does \"reaching out directly\" mean?reply",
      "I assume that they mean sending either a direct Linkedin message or an email to the recruiter or hiring manager.When I was recently unemployed I started doing that after months of getting ignored by most companies and, in my experience, the only difference is that I got far more acks (\"Hi! Sure, I'll take a look at your resume and reach out!\") but I got a similar rate of applications-to-interview compared to applying through the official platforms.reply",
