      "The complexity comes from needlessly combining two separate things into one: a simple repeating background pattern and a typeface. It's a \"serving suggestion\" when really all that's needed is the corn flakes.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, but if you are really picky you will want your background pattern to align nicely with your typeface. Sure, you can carefully try to ensure that each character is a multiple of some fixed unit and set your stripe size based on that. Then make sure that the start padding is correct. But every step of the way any differences in the text renderer and things like accessibility settings overriding font sizes will be working against you. If you want to use this on a website or any other medium that doesn't have a very strict and consistent rendering pipeline I can't think of a better way to do it than a font like this.\n \nreply",

      "I've really been trying to get Signal to get some decentralization[0] but unfortunately I pissed off some mods. I do understand their reasoning for staying away from full decentralization, both Moxie and Meredith have made good arguments. But I think this is something where there's a really good middle ground. Where both parties highly benefit.Users get a lot of added utility, \"fun\", and not to mention a huge upgrade in privacy and security (under local settings), while Signal gets to reduce a lot of data transfer over the network. There's a lot of use cases for local message and file sharing (see thread) and if the goal is to capture as little data as possible about the users, well let's not capture any network traffic when users are in close proximity, right? It's got to be a lot harder to pick up signals that only are available within a local proximity than signals traveling across the internet. The option of expanding to a mesh network can be implemented later[1] but I don't understand how an idea like this doesn't further the stated goals.The big problem with things like Briar is that you can't install it after the internet has been turned off AND it is already unpopular. But if an existing app with an existing userbase implements even some meshing then this benefits all those users when an event like that happens. Not to mention there's clear utility in day-to-day life.[0] https://community.signalusers.org/t/signal-airdrop/37402[1] I think a mesh network maintains the constraints both Moxie and Meredith have discussed, concerns about ensuring servers are up to data.

      "Okay I think I qualify. I'll bite.LeCun's argument is this:1) You can't learn an accurate world model just from text.2) Multimodal learning (vision, language, etc) and interaction with the environment is crucial for true learning.He and people like Hinton and Bengio have been saying for a while that there are tasks that mice can understand that an AI can't. And that even have mouse-level intelligence will be a breakthrough, but we cannot achieve that through language learning alone.A simple example from \"How Large Are Lions? Inducing Distributions over Quantitative Attributes\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01327) is this: Learning the size of objects using pure text analysis requires significant\ngymnastics, while vision demonstrates physical size more easily. To determine the size of a lion you'll need to read thousands of sentences about lions, or you could look at two or three pictures.LeCun isn't saying that LLMs aren't useful. He's just concerned with bigger problems, like AGI, which he believes cannot be solved purely through linguistic analysis.The energy minimization architecture is more about joint multimodal learning.(Energy minimization is a very old idea. LeCun has been on about it for a while and it's less controversial these days. Back when everyone tried to have a probabilistic interpretation of neural models, it was expensive to compute the normalization term / partition function. Energy minimization basically said: Set up a sensible loss and minimize it.)\n \nreply",
      "Doesn't Language itself encode multimodal experiences? Let's take this case write when we write text, we have the skill and opportunity to encode the visual, tactile, and other sensory experiences into words. and the fact is llm's trained on massive text corpora are indirectly learning from human multimodal experiences translated into language. This might be less direct than firsthand sensory experience, but potentially more efficient by leveraging human-curated information. Text can describe simulations of physical environments. Models might learn physical dynamics through textual descriptions of physics, video game logs, scientific papers, etc. A sufficiently comprehensive text corpus might contain enough information to develop reasonable physical intuition without direct sensory experience.As I'm typing this there is one reality that I'm understanding, the quality and completeness of the data fundamentally determines how well an AI system will work. and with just text this is hard to achieve and a multi modal experience is a must.thank you for explaining in very simple terms where I could understand\n \nreply",
      "I'm reminded of the story of Helen Keller, and how it took a long time for her to realize that the symbols her teacher was signing into her hand had meaning, as she was blind and deaf and only experienced the world via touch and smell. She didn't get it until her teacher spelled the word \"water\" as water from a pump was flowing over her hand. In other words, a multimodal experience. If the model only sees text, it can appear to be brilliant but is missing a lot. If it's also fed other channels, if it can (maybe just virtually) move around, if it can interact, the way babies do, learning about gravity by dropping things and so forth, it seems that there's lots more possibility to understand the world, not just to predict what someone will type next on the Internet.\n \nreply",

      "Imagine I give you a text of any arbitrary length in an unknown language with no images.

Some sequences of glyphs usually follow other sequences, eventually you could deduce a grammar, and begin putting together strings of glyphs that seem statistically likely compared to the source.You can do all the analysis you like and produce text that matches the structure and complexity of the source. A speaker of that language might even be convinced.At what point do you start building the space ship? When do you realize the source text was fictional?There's many untranslatable human languages across history. Famously, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. We had lots and lots of source text, but all context relating the text to the world had been lost. It wasnt until we found a translation on the Rosetta stone that we could understand the meaning of the language.Text alone has historically proven to not be enough for humans to extract meaning from an unknown language. Machines might hypothetically change that but I'm not convinced.Just think of how much effort it takes to establish bidirectional spoken communication between two people with no common language.

If nothing else, it would prove whether or not people are willing to pay for Firefox.The problem with Firefox currently is the organizational structure; the way that they need to monetize; the fact that you can't pay for Firefox development.

Three reasons:- It elevates the browser into a higher category of tool, where currently Firefox inhabits the same space as OS-bundled calculators and text editors, making it being paid more justifiable in peoples\u2019 minds.- Firefox has long had issues with rough edges and papercuts, which I believe frustrates users more than Mozilla probably realizes.- Much of Firefox\u2019s original claim to fame came from its highly flexible, power user friendly nature which was abandoned in favor of chasing mass appeal.\n \nreply",

We'll only ever just get marginally better privacy settings or whatever the next Pocket ends up being.Browsers are _user agents_. I want my user agent to serve me by being as frictionless as possible when I use it. I simply can't accept that what Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari/Opera have provided as the standard web browsing experience for the last two decades is a global maximum. We use the web in very different ways than we did a generation ago and yet Firefox 136 looks impressively similar to both Firefox 36 and Firefox 3.6. Take the gradients away from Chrome 1.0 and you could convince me a screenshot of it was their next version. If the browser is a tool, it's astounding that the tool has hardly evolved _at all_.I miss the days when Opera did all sorts of weird and wacky shit.

Part of that is probably because depending on the carrier, RCS may require access to certain SIM card information, which only pre-installed apps can do, and part of it is that many developers are waiting for Google to add RCS to the same API that SMS/MMS already exposes because they don't want to implement RCS themselves.Realistically, the target demographic for their documentation is 1) Apple (who they'd happily supply with details to get rid of the green bubble problem) and maybe 2) government officials looking into antitrust concerns. In theory someone working for LineageOS can implement an RCS client, though, but for those developers I don't think reverse engineering the remaining unknowns about the protocol (mostly \"what server\" and \"what message contents\") aren't that difficult.I'm not cryptographer, but I haven't heard any major issues from actual cryptographers about MLS.

A lot of other people have been porting APIs but actually you need to put a lot more thought into it because people don\u2019t memorize uuids that are required to make api calls. Memory is a good approach, but afraid of the recall aspect and how that could potentially cause tool calls with bad inputs.I built https://skeet.build where anyone can try out mcp for cursor and windsurf - we approached it with just brute force thoughtful design and a lot of trial and error.We did this because of a painpoint I experienced as an engineer having to deal with Jira and Linear - updating slack and all that friction. I noticed I copy and paste a lot to cursor and so spent time building this app.Mostly for workflows that I like:* start a PR with a summary of what I just did\n* slack or comment to linear/Jira with a summary of what I pushed\n* pull this issue from sentry and fix it\n* Find a bug a create a linear issue to fix it\n*  pull this linear issue and do a first pass\n* pull in this Notion doc with a PRD then create an API reference for it based on this code\n* Postgres or MySQL schemas for rapid model developmentEveryone seems to go for the hype but ease of use, practical pragmatic developer workflows, and high quality polished mcp servers are what we\u2019re focused onLmk what you think!\n \nreply",

The UI can then highlight those revisions transparently by applying strikethrough styling, coloration, dotted underline with tooltip on hover, etc.Like we've seen with human interactions and media, this may be susceptible to misinterpretation by the reader or listener, especially via second-hand clips or screenshots lacking full context.

A few years ago I was taking an AWS certification course and learned that their durability number means that one can expect to loose data about once every 10,000 years. Since then anytime I talk about S3's durability I bring up that example and it always seems to convey the point for a layperson.And it's \"simplicity\" is truly elegant. When I first started using S3 I thought of it as a dumb storage location but as I learned more I realized that it had some wild features that they all managed to hide properly so when you start it looks like a simple system but you can gradually get deeper and deeper until your S3 bucket is doing some pretty sophisticated stuff.Last thing I'll say is, you know your API is good when \"S3 compatable API\" is a selling point of your competitors.\n \nreply",

Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable \"c\" before the final \"k\". The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery.The sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, \"Mr X\". Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished; he later turned up in China.\"\n \nreply",
