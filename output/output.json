      "If you haven't been to Japan, it's worth lingering over these pictures and noticing a few things:- The complete absence of vandalism- How generally clean everything is- Accessibility strip for blind people (bumpy yellow stripe in train stations and sidewalks)- Nothing is broken or out of service- How safe and welcoming the public transit system feels.Japan is worth the journey if you ever want to step into a high-trust other dimension.\n \nreply",
      "Japan is definitely high trust and has a lot of advantages downstream of that. Though I think lots of that list is more of a \"vibrant Japanese city\" vibe (go up to some dying onsen town and you'll see plenty of broken shit and TVs dropped on the side of the road).Cleanliness is... mostly downstream of storefronts and the like picking shit up _all the time_. There are pockets of land that don't end up people's direct responsibility and end up getting very dirty very quickly. Little micro-pockets of trash that pile up (very quickly!). But lots of places you tend to have someone going around and just picking something up.For like a year there was a guy consistently eating his cup noodles or lunch box near my building, and he would just drop it near the bike parking. But we had somebody come by the building twice a week to deal with trash and the like and he was picking it up (I'd throw it into a garbage bag if I saw it and had one in my hand). Still though, like if I'd go on a midnight walk I'd see it.Turns out that the way super crowded places can be clean is by cleaning constantly (see also restrooms, which need to be constantly cleaned). \"Nothing is broken\" also definitely feels downstream of people fixing stuff promptly. Low latency when trying to deal with issues might be key.And an aside for the public transit... while the transit feels clean, ask most any woman living in Tokyo how they feel about riding public transit. Many might still grade it above other ones but I have heard many nasty experiences that white guys just don't get exposed to at all. Groping, verbal harassment, the works.EDIT: I mention lots of this to get to a bigger point: good things are possible! There is no magic entirely localized in the Japanese Isles.\n \nreply",
      "This is definitely part of government job programs. Paying people to keep your cities clean has a lot of advantages.\n \nreply",
      "Near my building it was the building manager. Most shops it's just a shop member that cleans up the stuff by the shop. At the McDonalds there's a staff member _constantly_ roving around cleaning tables up and picking up trash people leave (and they tend to not be able to keep up with the patronage trash generation...)It's just in the job description for most things honestly.\n \nreply",
      "You know how there are pictures of certain immigrants to NYC and other places in the early part of the XX century and they would show those people sweeping their stoops and sidewalks and generally keeping their neighborhoods tidy?Well, in Japan, you still see that.  Shop owners will go around their shop with a duster cleaning away any dust or cobwebs that might have sprung overnight.  Awnings, signs, etc.\n \nreply",
      "When I play Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio games like \"Lost Judgement\" or \"Like A Dragon\" I always find myself wondering if groping is a big deal over there.\n \nreply",
      "the problem is that complaining and making a fuss about things that bother you is frowned upon. especially for women. so they suffer in silence. and the games probably are mostly made by men, who of course don't think it is as much of a big deal. not much different from what it used to be in the west. if only samurai chivalry was more prevalent. but unfortunately keeping appearance (and not embarrassing others) is more important.",
      "Japanese are obsessed with being clean. Like wiping the pen with tissue paper before handing it to you. On more than one occasion I have had a stranger passenger on long distance train clearing my cup of coffee as she goes to throw hers in the trash. May be she is signalling you can't trust these foreigners to clean up before they leave!\n \nreply",
      "I went to Japan (first time) a few months ago, and I was blown away by almost everything (including what you mention). It's just so different from the US in almost every way, but so nice overall (people, cities, transit). I loved it and want to go back already.\n \nreply",
      "Having never been to Japan, I don\u2019t dispute anything you say, and as an American I definitely agree those things sound great.However I do think it\u2019s fair to point out the existence of women-only train cars in Japan, which I believe exist at least in part due to groping. Seems like YMMV depending on gender.\n \nreply"

This began with detached GPG signatures for builds, and progressed to Authenticode signing for Windows installers in Firefox 1.0.1. Since then it has evolved over time to encompass other platforms, other types of files within our products, and other ways that we ship (such as our own update packages).

Technology that seamlessly mixes symbolic equations, illustrative-and-explicative annotation, and runnable code is, I am sure, not far off. [2020; emphasis added]Back in the 1990's, we had lots of tools to write better mathematics: LaTeX, HTML, Mathematica notebooks, and so on. But it felt like nothing had really converged yet.

Given the preceding decades of cripplingly underfunded and glacial programming language evolution - that seemed a similar kind of society-hobbling infrastructure challenge that we just don't handle well. Now here we are, 3 decades later, and languages are in a far better place... though with pace still throttled by poor funding. Perhaps someday math tech will be too.

Getting Tailscale or a similar solution up and running is also on the to-do list.I know other people want direct integration with banking APIs, but for me it's actually a feature to have to enter everything manually. I'm deliberately working on better spending habits, and having a local set of data with me which is actually sometimes ahead of my bank in terms of cleared transactions is good. It means I build the habit of entering and categorizing each time I spend money, and it means I have to regularly reconcile accounts. It's only a hypothesis, but I suspect in the era of checkbooks the practical fact of having to keep up the books manually enforced better spending habits.[1a]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mn.flow.flow[1b]: Also, github: https://github.com/flow-mn/flowN.B.

Given the crisis of confidence among a sizeable (and very vocal) contingent of the Linux community, that decision has backfired horribly. And it's quite out of character for Linus not to have a blazingly clear opinion. (We all know his stance on C++, for instance.)As a pilot program, R4L should have graduated or ended a long time ago. After several years of active development, its status remains unclear. Instead of cracking heads to get everyone on the same page, Linus has instead spent all this time sitting back and watching his subordinates fight amongst themselves, only to then place responsibility for the drama on Martin's shoulders. Poor form.Arguably his reprimand of Martin is a clear signal that he will never show Rust any favor, but he hasn't said anything explicitly. Maybe he knows he should, but he fears the shitstorm it will cause. Maybe it's time for him to rip off the band-aid, though.And again, all of this could have been avoided if he'd just put his foot down one way or the other.

      "I wonder how much the Van Allen radiation belts are a contributor to the Fermi paradox, i.e. how much they contributed to providing a suitable place for life to originate and flourish, and how rare they are.The belts themselves are an effect of Earth's magnetic field, which I believe is particularly strong because of flow within the Earth's liquid iron-nickel outer core. (I had long believed that the spinning of the inner core was the primary contributor but given a surface-level skim of the literature that doesn't seem to be the case; convection seems to be more of a driver.)I think perhaps many otherwise similar planets don't have a liquid iron core, so they may not have the strong radiation belts that shield life from the solar wind. Of course I am not sure what fraction of otherwise-similar planets have liquid iron cores, but Mars for example does not seem to. It is probably a function of the size of a planet (governing the pressure distribution in the interior), the ratio of iron to other elements, the temperature field (a function of the amount of radiogenic elements in the planet and its age), and perhaps other factors. Other planets may not be hot enough to have a liquid iron core at the right pressures, or be too massive (too much pressure) at the right temperatures, etc.\n \nreply",
      "I've read that the relative contribution of planetary magnetic fields is overstated relative to atmospheres. The thickness of Earth's is the same mass as a 10 meter-high column of liquid water; not much radiation gets through that much shielding, magnetic field or no. (I think it's solely muons?)\n \nreply",
      "Earth is the only rocky planet in the solar system with a magnetic core so that'd be 1/4 at least.\n \nreply",
      "I'm pretty sure that the belts are a requirement for some types of life to originate and survive.  Along with Jupiter helping protect us, our location in the galaxy, etc.\n \nreply",
      "If abiogenesis occurred in the thermal vents deep under the ocean I believe that could have happened without the radiation protection as the water would be more than adequate.\n \nreply",
      "Sure, but small amounts of radiation are beneficial.  And those early organisms would eventually ahve to move to the shallows and land and deal with all the masked radiation at some point.  It's all speculation, we really have no idea whether it was vents-first or not.\n \nreply",
      "> And those early organisms would eventually [have] to move to the shallows and land and deal with all the masked radiation at some point.Do they, though? Why is land the requirement? What's keeping life from, say, evolving to live deep underground? Or in the deep ocean? Both those places are heavily shielded from radiation, and organisms there wouldn't be affected much at all by not having a magnetosphere. Extremophiles on Earth get by just fine hanging around thermal vents, for instance. (Edit: this was mentioned above and I didn't see it - sorry for repeating.)I think part of the problem with the Fermi paradox is that our base assumptions about what life needs are possibly a bit off. Maybe the fact that we have what we have is, well, quirky, and the fact that we evolved as living creatures that crawl around on the outside of our planet and need really fussy little temperatures to survive is just plain weird in comparison to the rest of the universe.\"Life as we know it\" is a lot tougher criterion to meet than \"life,\" I suspect.\n \nreply",
      "These are all fair questions, and to go further, life may not even have required light at all- there are chemoautotrophs living deep in the rock that never see light.I was going to say \"obviously, nothing I said above would apply to life as we don't know it, like on the surface of a neutron star\".\n \nreply",
      "I think that solar radiation isn't a direct danger to life, as it is quickly blocked by the surface of oceans and land. If an atmosphere turns out to be a major factor in the development of life, lack of a field could be a bigger impact. That said, atmospheric stripping like what happened to marks isnt sure bet. Venus has no internal Dynamo, but a massive atmosphere, despite 5X the solar radiation.\n \nreply",
      "Interesting, so the 2 new belts (fields) are closer than the 2 stable existing belts (Van Allen Belts) that shield us from radiation.These fields could affect the launch and operation of satellites. Or maybe they will help shield us further? Or affect our atmosphere in some way? To be studied...\n \nreply"

It looks natural E.g. to remove every second letter I could run '..:' which is technically '.(.:eps)':echo 'abcde' | ./trre '..:'result: 'ace'actually ':' association could have a meaning as a composition of regular relations; but I found it too complicated for now.\n \nreply",
      "I do not understand the rules by which you inject the epsilon and I think this is a source of confusion for many people. I had thought that an epsilon could be injected anywhere REGEX can appear (effectively allowing epsilon as a REGEX) but of course that just leads to infinite number of parses. Manually injecting epsilon is a highly hacky thing to do; better to consider that when you design the grammar.I would not worry about \"cat:dog:mouse\" because intuitively it is clearly correct and it means replacing cat with mouse. With parentheses it could be written as \"((cat:dog):mouse)\".\n \nreply",
      "Yeah. Similarly, for the range transformations, instead of `[a:A-z:Z]`, I would suggest `[a-z:A-Z]`; and instead of `[a:b-y:zz:a]`, something like `[a-y:b-z;z:a]`, perhaps.\n \nreply",

You have zero effort to provide and suddenly this stuff is in your mind. I'm not saying it's a good thing, I realize the danger, but that's the core mechanism.A friend in marketing describes this in terms of \"brain calories\". Eg if people have to think in order to understand your landing page, you failed to communicate your ideas efficiently, as it \"requires too many brain calories\". TikTok content requires zero brain calories.One could say that only very shallow information could be spread this way (eg people dancing, video game clips) but I'm not sure that's true. The real challenge would be to turn an arbitrary source of information (wikipedia, hn) and make it immediately graspable. I suspect modern AI models could already go quite far in this direction.Veritasium is a good example of interesting yet very graspable content:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@veritasium/video/7329576935317622058\n \nreply",

Established disciplines such as behavioral science, for example, say we don't need these disciplines, because they're problematic and add nothing.So I ask, Why haven't the sciences I speak of contributed more to the general discourse?\n \nreply",

      "Physicist here. The superconductivity in layered graphene is indeed surprisingly strange, but this popular article may not do it justice. Here are some older articles on the same topic that may be more informative: https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-twisted-graphene-became-t..., https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-twist-reveals-supercond....Let me briefly say why some reasons this topic is so interesting. Electrons in a crystal always have both potential energy (electrical repulsion) and kinetic energy (set by the atomic positions and orbitals). The standard BCS theory of superconductivity only works well when the potential energy is negligible, but the most interesting superconductors --- probably including all high temperature ones like the cuprates --- are in the regime where potential energy is much stronger than kinetic energy. These are often in the class of \"unconventional\" superconductors where vanilla BCS theory does not apply. The superconductors in layered (and usually twisted) graphene lie in that same regime of large potential/kinetic energy. However, their 2d nature makes many types of measurements (and some types of theories) much easier. These materials might be the best candidate available to study to get a handle on how unconventional superconductivity \"really works\". (Besides superconductors, these same materials have oodles of other interesting phases of matter, many of which are quite exotic.)\n \nreply",

      "I think everything we don't have a model for is surprisingly strange. Gravity only seems \"normal\" because we've been teaching a reasonable model for it for hundreds of years - Aristotle thought things fell to the ground because that was \"their nature\", but thought it quite weird. X-Rays seem bonkers unless you've grown up with them, and there is something deeply unnerving about genetics, quantum and even GenAI until you've spent some time pulling apart the innards and building an explainable model that makes sense to you. And even then it can catch you out. More ways to explain the models help normalise it all - what's now taught at 9th grade used to be advanced post-doc research, in almost every field. And so it goes on.2D superconductors don't make much sense because, as the article says, theory is behind experimentation here. That's also why there is both incredible excitement, but also a worry that none of this is going to stack up to anything more than a bubble. My old Uni (Manchester) doubled down hard on the work of Geim and Novoselov by building a dedicated \"Graphene Institute\", after they got the Nobel Prize, but even 15 years after that award most people are still trying to figure out what does it all actually mean really? Not just in terms of the theory of physics, but how useful is this stuff, in real world usage?It'll settle down in due course. The model will become apparent, we'll be able to explain it through a series of bouncing back between theory and experiment, as ever, and then it won't seem so strange any more.I'm not sure that'll ever be true of quantum computing for me, but then I am getting a bit older now...\n \nreply",

      "Here's the thing: I bet if you were to take the children who performed well at complex abstract mathematical problems and placed them in a job that required complex applied mathematical skill, the ones who eventually performed best would be the same. And vice-versa for the children who excelled at complex applied mathematics. So mathematical skill might not be immediately transferable, but would be a useful indicator of innate ability.This relates to the (somewhat controversial) economic theory that much of higher education is not about training or creating transferable skills, and instead is about \"signaling\". Essentially, we place children in simulated quasi-work settings and use it to determine who has the most of certain economically valuable abilities. By performing well at abstract mathematics, a child signals that they have the requisite mental ability to tackle similarly complex \"real world\" problems. But also, they signal that they are capable of obeying authority, working with diligence, delaying gratification, etc.\n \nreply",

In my experience, most people, even those with college degrees (and therefore some exposure to it) have a hard time grasping abstract theory of anything, especially its usefulness, and a harder time applying it. If I say, 'There is no perfect security; we need to make the attack more expensive for the attacker than it's worth to them. The existing system A is wasting resources because it is not protecting something valuable ...'; they ignore everything and might even say 'why are you telling me that?', and then 'will system B perfectly secure this asset?'It's always alarming for me.

      "Inko is an interesting language, though the handling for panics sounds disturbing. Based on the documentation, panics abort the whole program and are not recoverable.Things like dividing by zero or accessing an index outside of the bounds of an array will panic.While these aren\u2019t incredibly common, I would never want my whole production web server to go down because some random, infrequently used endpoint had a bug in some edge case.The language seems heavily inspired by Erlang, which is very resilient to programmer errors in comparison.In Erlang, the philosophy is to let a lightweight process crash and restart it when there is a problem. This doesn\u2019t need to have any effect on other lightweight processes that are running.\n \nreply",
      "Panics are meant to be used sparingly and as a last resort, and are meant to signal \"this code is utterly broken, go fix it\". Handling such errors at runtime (e.g. by restarting just a lightweight process) doesn't make much sense, as you'll keep running into the issue over and over again and possibly even end up ignoring it.For runtime error handling you'd use algebraic types such as Result and Option, similar to most functional languages and Rust.The reason we don't allow catching of panics (such as Rust allows) is because it can result in people more or less ignoring such errors (something I've seen happen far too often in past projects) and just retrying over and over again, achieving the same result every time. I'd much rather have the program crash and scream loudly, forcing developers to address the issue. Fortunately, the chances of you actually running into a panic at runtime should be pretty slim, so not being able to catch them shouldn't be much of an issue in practice.\n \nreply",
      "Thats fair, and it\u2019s your language to design how you think is best. Just throwing out my two cents here based on my personal experiences.I have 2000+ developers at my work, many of them making changes on a single huge web application. Compile/publish of the testing servers takes several hours and happens regularly throughout the day. There are thousands of testers all testing many different workflows all the time.If one developer makes a mistake in a dark corner of the code one day, it seems bad to have the whole server crashing and disrupting all the other testing that\u2019s going on for multiple hours while we wait for a fix and another build.Quality and fix prioritization is in the hands of project teams for usability problems, performance problems, functional problems, etc. Uncaught exceptions should be logged somewhere, and it\u2019s ultimately up to the team to decide whether they care enough to fix them or not.\n \nreply",
      "I feel like if that's your take, then things like array indexing or dividing by zero should never panic. Because running into those things at runtime is very hard to prevent (unless you have tooling for enforcing that statically?)\n \nreply",
      "There are cases where you might want to choose: crash and burn, or handle at runtime. Where this makes sense, Inko does actually let you do that. For example, array indexing is done using one of two methods:- Array.get/Array.get_mut for when you want to panic on an out-of-bounds index- Array.opt/Array.opt_mut for when you want an Option type, with it being a None for an out of bounds indexSo for example:    [10, 20, 30].get(0)  => 10\n    [10, 20, 30].get(42) => panic\n    [10, 20, 30].opt(0)  => Option.Some(10)\n    [10, 20, 30].opt(42) => Option.None\n\nThis pattern is applied across the standard library where this makes sense, such that the developer can pick which option works best for their needs.There are a few places where we check for some input at runtime and panic if this is invalid, but this is limited to cases where there's simply no sensible alternative (e.g. providing a key with an invalid size to a ChaCha20 cipher).\n \nreply",
      "That's why you have wrappers that return Result enumerations. There is an overhead to check if an operation is valid, pay for it if you need it.This is exactly how Rust works, for example.\n \nreply",
      "How is it knowing to panic if it isn\u2019t checking? It seems like I am paying the cost of doing the checking either way, at least in terms of performance. So it should give me the ability to handle the error somehow.As a C# and Typescript developer primarily, this concept of killing the whole program due to a bug anywhere in any part of the code is very foreign to me.I\u2019d expect that to only happen if you ran out of memory, had a hardware failure, or other such catastrophic error. To me, dividing by zero is a problem, but not worse than pretty much any other type of logical error that doesn\u2019t panic.\n \nreply",
      "> killing the whole program due to a bug anywhere in any part of the code is very foreign to me.But getting the wrong answer due to a bug anywhere in any part of the code is not?\n \nreply",
      "Programs have all kinds of bugs for all kinds of reasons. That\u2019s why you need unit testing, functional testing, performance testing, usability testing, accessibility testing, etc.Why single out just a few types of bugs to crash the whole program? Let me catch it and decide what to do.If it\u2019s in a single request to my web server, I\u2019d like that single request return an error code. I would not like all other concurrent requests for all other users to fail as well.\n \nreply",
