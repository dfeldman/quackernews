      "Okay, this is cool.It's a copper-tantalum-lithium alloy: 96.5% Cu, 3% Ta, 0.5% Li.Tantalum isn't soluble in copper and doesn't form any intermetallic compounds, so under normal circumstances you'd get something like a metal matrix composite -- pure tantalum particles dispersed in a copper matrix.  Add lithium, though, and the intermetallic Cu3Li forms, and tantalum is apparently very attracted to this stuff, so you end up with Cu3Li particles with Ta shells in that copper matrix.Yield Strength = ~1000MPa, so it's genuinely on par with high-temp nickel superalloys, though somewhat weaker than the cobalt-base ones, and far weaker than the best steels.Interestingly, it's actually a little bit weaker than the copper-beryllium alloy C17200.  (YS: ~1200-1300 MPa.)  But CuBe is very expensive, not very ductile, and potentially hazardous.  Tantalum, though expensive, is still 10x cheaper than beryllium.Depending on its thermal and electrical properties, and on its ease of manufacture, this could be a very versatile material, and may replace nickel/cobalt alloys in certain applications.\n \nreply",

Ginzburg draws on Church records, including the man's own written defense, and builds a fascinating picture of his mental world, intellect, and disposition.If I remember correctly, these small, cloudy windows into the Early Modern past even let Ginzburg identify likely traces of pre-Christian, or folk, traditions largely hidden from the written record.This is a funny example, I suppose, because in all likelihood the miller would have been tickled to know that his ideas survived and found an audience not just despite but because of Church persecution.Still, his case nicely illustrates the importance and unpredictable value of the historical record.\n \nreply",

These are ecological niches that are old, and extremely divergent.

When you get a genome (especially back when this work was initiated), you'd BLAST all the gene sequences against all known organisms to look for homologs. That's how you'd annotate what the gene does. Much more often than not, you'd get back zero results - these genes had absolutely no sequence similarity to anything else known.My PI would go through and clone every gene of the virus into bacteria to express the protein. If the protein was soluble, we'd crystallize it. And basically every time, once the structure was solved, if you did a 3D search (using Dali Server or PDBe Fold), there would be a number of near identical hits.In other words, these genes had diverged entirely at the sequence level, but without changing anything at the structural (and thus functional) level.Presumably, if AlphaFold is finding the relationship, there's some information preserved at the sequence level - but that could potentially be indirect, such as co-evolution.

      "Outside of professional software jobs, for me code is also a form of personal expression.  I code for work.  But I also code for fun.  Although there is some overlap in the experience between the two, the two forms of coding are wildly different.I probably don't need to explain much about coding at work. It's not just about \"writing code\".  It's about software engineering.  It's a responsibility that requires professionalism, discipline, and care.  The real focus isn't the code itself.  The focus is first and foremost on the business problems.  Good code, good algorithms, and solid engineering practices are simply means to an end in solving those problems effectively.But in my free time, coding is something else entirely.  It's a form of art and expressing myself.  It all started with IBM PC Logo and GW-BASIC, where writing code to draw patterns on the screen was my way of creating art.  While some kids painted with brushes and watercolours, I painted with code and CGA colours.Coding in my leisure time is a way for me to create, explore, and express my silly ideas without the constraints of business requirements or deadlines.  It's where I get to experiment, play, and bring ideas, no matter how trivial or pointless, to life purely for the joy of it.  Occasionally, these small experiments evolve into something I'm comfortable sharing online.  That's when I write up a README.md, add a LICENSE.md, commit the code to my repo, and push it to GitHub or Codeberg to share with others hoping fellow like-minded individuals might find joy or utility in these experiments.Fortunately, I've been able to release a few projects that have gathered small communities of users. For example, my last such project was https://susam.net/myrgb.html which, as far as I can tell, has got about 50 to 60 daily users.  It's a small number but it's not nothing.  While coding for leisure has always been enjoyable, the presence of these small communities has also been quite motivating.I think it is possible to do both with some luck.  While coding for work happens almost everyday by necessity, I think coding for leisure can also happen along with it, provided other circumstances of life don't get in the way.  If circumstances allow, it is certainly possible.  It doesn't have to happen everyday.  I know everyone has got responsibilities in their lives.  I've got too.  But it can happen once in a while, when a spark of inspiration strikes.  For me, it usually happens on some weekends when I get an itch to explore an idea, something I feel compelled to implement and see through.\n \nreply",

I don't know how often unauthorized IMSI catchers are used in the wild, but I doubt it's a relevant percentage of the total amount of IMSI catchers out there.Thanks to mmWave and beam forming, 5G allows operators to practically track you down to the exact centimeter in 3D space. Furthermore, depending on how willing the firmware of your modem is, the signal used to transfer GPS coordinates to the carrier for emergency response situations can also be triggered remotely by carrier hardware.Basically, who needs IMSI catchers when you can just see all of the information you'd get from them remotely on a computer screen on the other side of the country?Of course this is great to protect against criminals that are looking to find your personal phone number or whatever by showing up to your doorstep, but for the vast majority of cases, IMSI catchers are defeated because they're no longer necessary.\n \nreply",

      "Figuring out which of two things is bigger is hard. The article lightly touches on the two main reasons:- Sometimes the definition is complicated. E.g., I'd accept a computer 10x slower at most tasks if a particular small subset were sped up even 2x. No symmetric mean (geometric, arithmetic, harmonic, or otherwise) will appropriately capture that.- Nobody agrees on the definition. Even for very regular workloads, parsing protobufs is very different from old-school ML is very different from reversing the endianness of an unaligned data fragment. Venturing into even more diverse workloads muddies the waters further.The article basically gives up and says that the geometric mean is the least bad option because it has some nice properties (ones I don't think anyone cares about for this purpose...) and because it's what everyone expects.That latter argument is at least based in something sound, but I think the real point here is that attempting to come up with a single definitive \"speed\" is foolhardy in the first place.

To figure out what calculation to use, one has to made tradeoffs about desirable properties such as resilience to outliers, being bias-free, and/or having the best predictive performance in least-squared error. Bringing some grizzled statisticians into the conversation will probably clear a lot up. They are familiar with the pros and cons of various measures of central tendency.In the era of multivariate models, machine learning, and AI, some of the classic wisdom from good-old linear modeling gets overlooked.\n \nreply",
      "Metrics can be useful when they are thoughtfully chosen for the context in which they are used. The more abstract or synthetic a benchmark is, the less context there is to inform such a choice. Said another way, metrics characterizing synthetic benchmarks inherit/expose one of the key problems of synthetic benchmarks - a lack of context.In practical settings, the way to characterize performance will be more clear from context, often giving one (-ish) clear metric for each dimension you care about. For example, if an endpoint has a hard timeout of 100 ms, then it's pretty interesting to look at the percentage of real world requests that are faster than 100 ms. If the same solution is also used in a setting where throughput is more important than latency, then an additional metric is probably needed for that use case. Multiple metrics are needed for multiple use cases to capture trade-offs being made between those use cases.\n \nreply"

      "Fun fact that was dredged up because the author mentions Australia: GPS points change. Their example coordinates give 6 decimal places, accurate to about 10-15cm. Australia a few years back shifted all locations 1.8m because of continental drift they\u2019re moving north at ~7cm/year). So even storing coordinates as a source of truth can be hazardous. We had to move several thousand points for a client when this happened.\n \nreply",
      "Even accounting for tectonic drift, there is a concept of positioning reproducibility that is separate from precision. In general the precision of the measurements is much higher than the reproducibility of the same measurements. That is, you may be able to measure a fixed point on the Earth using an instrument with 1cm precision at a specific point in time but if you measure that same point every hour for a year with the same instrument, the disagreement across measurements will often be >10cm (sometimes much greater), which is much larger than e.g. tectonic drift effects.For this reason, many people use the reproducibility rather than instrument precision as the noise floor. It doesn\u2019t matter how precise an instrument you use if the \u201cfixed point\u201d you are measuring doesn\u2019t sit still relative to any spatial reference system you care to use.\n \nreply",

      "Related but slightly different. The accuracy is real but it is only valid at a point in time. Consequently, you can have both high precision and high accuracy that nonetheless give different measurements depending on when the measurements were made.In most scientific and engineering domains, a high-precision, high-accuracy measurement is assumed to be reproducible.\n \nreply",
      "GPS coordinates actually account for the motion of the Earth's tectonic plates. The problem is that it's a highly approximate model that doesn't accurately reflect areas like Australia very well.There's a great visualizer of the coordinate velocity from the Earthscope team:https://www.unavco.org/software/visualization/GPS-Velocity-V...\n \nreply",
      "GPS coordinates do not account for tectonic motion. It is a synthetic spheroidal model that is not fixed to any point on Earth.

If the tectonic plate your house is built on moves a meter over the course of a decade, then your house's GPS coords will change in the lower decimals, and eventually your government's land registry will need to update those values.\n \nreply",
      "If WGS84 was correcting for tectonic drift it would imply that the coordinates of the terrestrial fixed points used to compute the reference meridian never change under WGS84. Rebasing the coordinates of terrestrial fixed points prior to calculation disregards tectonic drift in the reference meridian calculation, it doesn\u2019t correct it. It is a noise reduction exercise to minimize the influence of plate tectonics on meridian drift. The meridian uses non-terrestrial fixed points too that don\u2019t have a concept of tectonic drift (but may introduce their own idiosyncratic sources of noise).Basically, these are corrections to their \u201cfixed points\u201d to make them behave more like actual fixed points in the reference meridian model.

This means you need to be hypervigilant of everything the LLM produces, and you need to review everything with the kind of care with which you review intern contributions.The second is that the LLMs don\u2019t learn once they\u2019re done training, which means I could spend the rest of my life tutoring Claude and it\u2019ll still make the exact same mistakes, which means I\u2019ll never get a return for that time and hypervigilance like I would with an actual junior engineer.That problem leads to the final problem, which is that you need a senior engineer to vet the LLM\u2019s code, but you don\u2019t get to be a senior engineer without being the kind of junior engineer that the LLMs are replacing - there\u2019s no way up that ladder except to climb it yourself.All of this may change in the next few years or the next iteration, but the systems as they are today are a tantalizing glimpse at an interesting future, not the actual present you can build on.\n \nreply",

It's true that many engineer-designed products are terrible, but I'd argue that most engineers have pretty good product sense.The problem is that engineers have a conflict of interest that leads to them making sub-optimal product decisions. A non-technical product person gets the \"luxury\" of only thinking \"what is the best product for the user?\", so they end up with a good design. But an engineer can't help but also factor in \"i'm the one that has to build this, so how much extra work am i giving myself?\" so they're design will be a compromise of what's good for the user and what can be built easily.this can have big consequences for how an org should divide work. If somebody has a broad set of responsibilities, they can't help but make tradeoffs (that they might not even be cognizant of) because they're weighing multiple objective functions.So, when it comes time for figuring out who should be in charge of strategy, it might not just be an issue of \"who's better\" but more an issue of \"who has the least conflict of interest\"\n \nreply",

      "I don't think this is a conflict of interest.Every feature, design decision, and iota of technical debt are money and time. Either that's raised and spent up front, eating at equity, or it is deferred until a point where revenue pays for it, it is redundant due to a pivot, or becomes so essential that new funding is raised (possibly from a pool that doesn't dilute so much value).Presenting an accurate and fair cost / benefit analysis of these tradeoffs (at least on the technical side) is the main purpose of a technical lead. Non-technical business people can't get that information on their own.
