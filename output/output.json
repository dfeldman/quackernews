      "> This isn't academic nit-picking. It's how medical research works when lives are on the line. Your startup's growth deserves the same rigor.But does it, really? A lot of companies sell... well, let's say \"not important\" stuff. Most companies don't cost peoples' lives when you get it wrong. If you A/B test user signups for a startup that sells widgets, people aren't living or dying based on the results. The consequences of getting it wrong are... you sell fewer widgets?While I understand the overall point of the post -- and agree with it! -- I do take issue with this particular point. A lot of companies are, arguably, _too rigorous_ when it comes to testing.At my last company, we spent 6 weeks waiting for stat sig. But within 48 hours, we had a positive signal. Conversion was up! Not statistically significant, but trending in the direction we wanted. But to \"maintain rigor,\" we waited 6 weeks before turning it... and the final numbers were virtually the same as the 48 hour numbers.Note: I'm not advocating stopping tests as soon as something shows trending in the right direction. The third scenario on the post points this out as a flaw! I do like their proposal for \"peeking\" and subsequent testing.But, really, let's just be realistic about what level of \"rigor\" is required to make decisions. We aren't shooting rockets into space. We're shipping software. We can change things if we get them wrong. It's okay. The world won't end.IMO, the right framing here is: your startup deserves to be as rigorous as is necessary to achieve its goals. If its goals are \"stat sig on every test,\" then sure, treat it like someone might die if you're wrong. (I would argue that you have the wrong goals, in this case, but I digress...)But if your goals are \"do no harm, see if we're heading in the right vector, and trust that you can pivot if it turns out you got a false positive,\" then you kind of explicitly don't need to treat it with the same rigor as a medical test.\n \nreply",

I remember showing Rebel Without a Cause.  We had a video projector in the same room though and had found it was cheaper to get a license to show VHS tapes which was a lot easier on the projectionist although it was much worse quality.\n \nreply",
      "Interesting that the film material had better color retention than the old projectors. I never thought about it before and assumed that the washed out colors of old 16mm projections came from bad recordings.\n \nreply",

So you want to position the radiator with the in/our ports lower, giving a low-turbulence chamber towards the top of the radiator for bubbles to accumulate.Opinions differ, but 800+watts through a 2-fan radiator, in an already hot environment, is likely not enough.

      "I worked for about 8 months on an internal product for doing transmission studies at a large utility company. Basically, it would feed a PSS/E [1] file specifying most of the transmission grid into a power flow simulation software called TARA [2]. We would add a few extra elements to the grid to simulate a wind or solar plant. TARA would spit out all the components that would be overloaded, with or without contingencies. We would read the results and estimate the transmission costs.Essentially, we were replicating the process that the ISOs used internally. The users of this product were all former ISO employees. The goal was to speed up the process of determining whether transmission costs were going to ruin a project before any money was spent. ISOs take months to do their analysis. The users told me that they were usually looking for $0 transmission upgrades on $50m+ projects.The grid and contingency files from the ISOs were under confidentiality agreements. This rubbed me the wrong way from a competition point of view. We also had data about projects slated to be built which could take away capacity from our projects.I could see a SaaS in doing this sort of analysis. It's probably bureaucratic between reselling TARA, NDAs, and maybe legal issues if the analysis was wrong. I have doubts about the market, most of the money is in big projects at big companies that are already doing this sort of thing.[1] https://www.siemens.com/global/en/products/energy/grid-softw...[2] https://power-gem.co/software/tara-software/\n \nreply",

      "Hi HN, I'm Anton, founder of Luna Rail.I've always thought night trains are a fantastic, sustainable alternative to short-haul flights, but they're often held back by a lack of privacy, comfort, and poor economics due to low passenger capacity.I became overly fascinated with this puzzle. I view it as a kind of night train Tetris (my wife less charitably calls it \"sardinology\"). I spent way too much  time learning about and sketching various layouts, trying to figure out how to fit the maximum number of private cabins into a standard railcar, while making them attractive for both day and night travel.This eventually led to a physical workshop (in Berlin) and a hands-on rapid prototyping process. We've built a series of full-scale mockups, starting with wood and cardboard and progressing to high-fidelity versions with 3D-printed and CNC-milled parts, with various functional elements.Hundreds of people have come in to test our various iterations, because you can't test ergonomics or comfort by looking at renderings (although we did create a bunch of nice ones).The link goes to our home page showing our approach and some of the thinking behind them. It\u2019s been a lot of fun working on this puzzle, and we're excited to share what we've come up with. We hope you think it's cool too and would love to hear your thoughts.\n \nreply",

      "tbh that's not the flex. storing 100PB of logs just means we haven't figured out what's actually worth logging. metrics + structured events can usually tell 90% of the story. the rest? trace level chaos no one reads unless prod's on fire. what'd could've done better be: auto pruning logs that no alert ever looked at. or logs that never hit a search query in 3 months. call it attention weighted retention. until then this is just high end digital landfill with compression\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019m of the opposite opinion. It\u2019s better to ingest everything and then filter out the stuff you don\u2019t want at the observability platform.The problem of filtering out debug logs is you don\u2019t need them, until you do. And then trying to recreate an event you can\u2019t even debug is often impossible. So it\u2019s easier to then retrieve those debug logs if they\u2019re already there but hidden.\n \nreply",
      "Once a bug is closed the value of those logs starts to decay. And the fact is that we get punished for working on things that aren\u2019t in the sprint, and working on \u201cdone done\u201d stories is one of those ways. Even if you want to clean up your mess, there\u2019s incentive not to. And many of us very clearly don\u2019t like to clean up our own messes, so a ready excuse gets them out of the conversation about a task they don\u2019t want to be voluntold to do.\n \nreply",
      "In DevOps (et al) the value of those logs doesn\u2019t decay in the same way it does in pure dev.Also, as I pointed out elsewhere, modern observability platforms enable a way to have those debug logs available as an archive that can be optionally ingested after an incident but without filling up your regular quota of indexed logs. Thus giving you the best of both worlds (all logging but without the expense and flooding your daily logs with debug messages)\n \nreply",
      "My approach for this is to add dev logging IN ALL CAPS so that it stands out as ugly and \"need adjusting\", which is to delete it before merging to main.\n \nreply",
      "You really need to define how much you are willing to spend on logging/observability as a percentage of total budget. IMHO 5% is bare minimum 10% is better. I've worked for a company that had a dedicated storage array just for logging with Splunk and it was amazing and very much worth the money.Good automatic tiering for logs is very useful as the most recent logs tend to be the most useful. I like NVMe -> hard disk -> tape library. LTO tape storage is cheap enough you don't need to delete data until it is VERY old.\n \nreply",
      "> then filter out the stuff you don\u2019t wantThis is often easier said than done.  And there's ginormous costs associated with logging everything.  Money that can be better spent elsewhere.Also, logging everything creates yet another security hole to worry about.\n \nreply",
      "> And there's ginormous costs associated with logging everythingIf you use a tool that defaults the log spew to a cheap archive, sampling to the fast store, and a way to pull from the archive on-demand much of that is resolved. FWIW I think most orgs get big scared at seeing $$$ in their cloud bills, but don't properly account for time spent by engineers rummaging around for data they need but don't have.\n \nreply",
      ">but don't properly account for time spent by engineers rummaging around for data they need but don't haveThis is a tricky one that's come up recently. How you you quantify the value of $$$ observability platform? Anecdotally I know robust tracing data can help me find problems in 5-15 minutes that would have taken hours or days with manual probing and scouring logs.Even then you have the additional challenge of quantifying the impact of the original issue.\n \nreply",
      "At the end of the day it's just vibes. If the company is one that sees:- Reliability as a cost center- Vendor costs are to be limited- CIO-driven rather than CTO-drivenThen it's going to be a given that they prioritize costs that are easy to see, and will do things like force a dev team to work for a month to shave ~2k/month off of a cloud bill. In my experience, these orgs will also sometimes do a 180 when they learn that their SLAs involve paying out to customers at a premium during incidents, which is always very funny to observe. Then you talk to some devs and they say things like \"we literally told them this would happen years ago and it fell on deaf ears\" or something.\n \nreply"

At that time, VIM was still very new, so \"VIM memes\" weren't yet part of the tech landscape.Before VIM, there was vi. In Usenet posts - about 15 years before Google - people used to add a pithy humorous sentence at the bottom called \"tagline\" - here is one:  \"How do you exit vi?
