      "Tried openscad and then cadquery for some geometry iteration projects and found them clunky. It wasn't just that I was missing a UI; the functions, constraints and geometry kernel weren't as powerful as onshape, which I've used a bit, and presumably light years behind fusion 360, which I haven't used.Even freecad, a UI-based oss cad, is not quite ergonomic for a beginner-to-intermediate user, though it has come a long way in the past few years.I'm excited for there to eventually be a good open source cad option, whether language-only or language-plus-GUI, but am also increasingly on team 'tools matter for your productivity'.reply",

Being able to interact like this makes it much quicker and easier to iterate on a design.I read through the ucad website and book for 10 minutes and haven't been able to figure out if there is an analogue to this for ucad?There are several things that look neat about ucad's language, but I would need to recreate something like openscad's workflow to consider switching.reply",
      "That immediacy is mostly thanks to OpenCSG which is essentially a magic trick to quickly fake 3d rendering of booleans between 3d objects using stencil buffer of gpu.  http://opencsg.org/In other words it renders the cylinders cubes spheres etc and their unions differences etc, to a 2d screen without actually calculating the intersection of those meshes / solids in 3d space.This is the special thing about OpenSCAD design is they figured out how to build an abstract syntax tree that could either be sent to OpenCSG, CGAL (old engine),  Manifold (new engine), or even the bare bones 'ThrownTogether' renderer (ancient engine on machines with no gpu that just draws 'negatives' as green blobs iirc).It should be theoretically possible for any CAD program to do this. its just a lot of work.reply",

The way I think about the construction of models is much more suited to standard programming techniques. I freely admit there is probably immense value in using the industry standard tools instead... I've printed a few projects now which I used OpenSCAD to design, and it went fairly well, and I'm confident in them. OpenSCAD is a bit of a PITA though.I have no idea if this approach might gain traction over sketch-based CAD, I doubt it; yet this approach has a strong chance of expanding the space.reply",

      "Writing a calculus book that's more rigorous than typical books is hard because if you go too hard, people will say that you've written a real analysis book and the point of calculus is to introduce certain concepts without going full analysis. This book seems to have at least avoided the trap of trying to be too rigorous about the concept of convergence and spending more time on introducing vocabulary to talk about functions and talking about intersections with linear algebra.reply",

Linear algebra was added to both volumes in their second editions, which came out in 1967 for volume 1 and 1969 for volume 2.The second editions are still the current edition, so no worry that you might be missing out on something if you go with used copies. If you do want new copies (maybe you can't find used copies or they are in bad shape) take a look at international editions.A new copy of the international edition for India from a seller in India on AbeBooks is around $15 per volume plus around $19 shipping to the US. Same contents as the US edition but paperback instead of hardback, smaller pages, and rougher paper. (International editions also often replace color with grayscale but that's not relevant in this case because Apostol does not use color)).You can also find US sellers on AbeBooks that has imported an international edition.

      "Something I never see mention is that all agents / CLI tools seem to modify local files. Which makes editing current files, working with the git, asking to only modify some parts of the files etc. cumbersome, as the agent is constantly reading and writing to files that we are also accessing. This is usually solved by using git worktree but this solution requires 1 new folder name and branch for each new agent, and each folder will have its own unique name and others issues.While it can be super powerful, I wish there was a quicker \"in memory\" agent solution where each agent keeps in its own RAM the list of files modifications (\"patch\") it recommends to apply to solve current issue. Then we could apply that patch depending on what we're doing, if we have others patches to apply before etc.Also even if agents can work in parallel, sometimes we only have 1 of them in front of us and if we already know what's the next thing we're gonna ask, we'll still wait for the previous task to be completed before sending the new prompt. I'm not sure how to improve this async problem, I guess I could launch multiple agents in parallel but I wouldn't get sharing of the chat history between the different agents, and when I work I usually work on related issues that depend on each others, thus I do need some kind of global or shared context between agents analyzing codebases and creating patches.Anyone has ideas over how to improve those AI coding agents workflows ?

      "Nice article, though the diagram showing [OpenGL] [WebGL] [WebGPU] being built on Vulkan and then from Vulkan to D3D12 and Metal is wrong. WebGL and WebGPU go directly to D3D and Metal, they do not go through Vulkan firstAlso, Vulkan is labeled as Open Source. It is not open source.The are other mistakes in that area as well. It claims WebGPU is limited to Browsers. It is, not. WebGPU is available as both a C++ (Dawn) and a Rust (WGPU) library. Both run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. It is arguably the most cross platform library. Tons of native projects using both libraries.Vulkan is also not really cross-platform any more than DirectX . DirectX runs on 2 platforms (listed in the aritcle). Vulkan runs on 2+ platforms, Android, and Linux. It runs on Windows but not on all windows. For example, in a business context using Remote Desktop, Vulkan is rarely available. It is not part of Windows, and is not installed by default. Graphics card companies (NVidia, AMD) include it. Windows itself does not. Vulkan also does not run on MacOS nor iOSreply",

Vulkan is just a header file, it's up to the various independent hardware vendors (IHVs) to implement it for their platform.Also a small correction: Vulkan actually _does_ run Apple platforms (via Vulkan-to-Metal translation) using MoltenVK and the new KosmicKrisp driver, and it works quite well.reply",

      "The big news here is that Racket now can run threads in parallel. While there were ways to get parallelism before (like places), this is much more lightweight and familiar. Anything that expands the areas where Racket is viable is good news to me since I like writing stuff in Racket.reply",
      "While reading the release notes, I was also surprised, that they finally have this kind of multi-threading. I knew about places, but they were kind of inflexible, as you couldn't easily send a lambda in Racket, and serializable-lambda was infectious, so one ended up having to pre-define all logic and at runtime only sending data not functions to other places, which was a shame. One could not really build a thing that distributes work via multiple places with that. Or at least no one managed to do that and no one could tell me how to do it. I hope that with the new concurrency stuff this is now possible, even if it may not be as conceptually clean as places were supposed to be.Ultimately, multi-threading is one reason, why I mostly used GNU Guile, instead of Racket in recent years. Guile's story of using multiple cores is much more solid, using its futures and possibly fibers via a library. I have used futures, which are backed by a pool of threads underneath, to implement a toy parallelized decision tree algorithm/model, that had linear (or close to) speedup.reply",

      "This is addressed in the blog post linked from the release announcement: https://blog.racket-lang.org/2025/11/parallel-threads.htmlreply",
      "That post is even more worrisome!> To address larger problems with the implementation and to improve performance, we started in 2017 rebuilding Racket on top of Chez Scheme. Rebuilding took some time, and we only gradually deprecated the old \u201cBC\u201d implementation in favor of the new \u201cCS\u201d implementation, but the transition is now complete. Racket BC is still maintained, but as of August 2025, we distribute only Racket CS buildsSo they're billing Racket as \"Mature Practical Extensible Robust and Polished\". Of those I will give them \"Extensible\" and \"Robust\". You can't say you're mature and polished and practical if you've just rewritten the entire thing and deprecated the legacy codebase to support new features that have been in other languages since forever.Maybe they were talking about Racket 8.0 and didn't change the website yet?reply",
      "How rewriting something internally makes Racket not mature? Sounds like refactoring to me and with an extensive test suite there's nothing to be hysterical about.reply",
      "Maybe I just have a different working definition of these words. To me \"mature\" means \"fully developed\" and \"polished\" means \"achieved a high level of refinement\". To me, rewriting it all to introduce a major feature that fills in a longstanding hole in the language doesn't say \"mature and polished\". Because often times many bugs are introduced into a codebase on a major rewrite despite extensive test suites, especially at the interfaces between features. Typically people might prefer a mature codebase to one that's just been rewritten precisely because it hasn't been vetted over years. \"mature rewrite\" sounds like an oxymoron to me, and I guess no one else agrees but I find it strange. That is all.reply"

They are sweating an asset into people like us, who want cheap disk but not the 100% reliable coverage of a contract which gives us replication, offsite, 3-2-1 class services.

We were making a game that consistently triggered assertion failures related to FPU calculations, but only on a single PC in the whole office. The game was explicitly setting FPU precision to 32 bits at the start to make all calculations more consistent. However, on that particular PC, there was a fancy hand writing input software that injected its DLL into every process. As you've probably already guessed, that DLL did FPU mode reset to the default in the event handling loop (i.e., main thread).

      "There's judging people, and there's judging actions.- Getting married under societal pressure even when you're pretty sure you're gay:  I'm willing to cut him some slack on this.- Having gay affairs while you're married: It puts your wife at risk of disease, but OK, you've been placed in a messed up, lose-lose situation.- Telling a lover you want to be exclusive, and getting him to move to a completely new country, stringing him along with the idea that someday you'll leave your wife and live with him, when in fact you intend neither to leave your wife nor to be exclusive: Uuh, OK, that's actually pretty bad.- You know your wife wants to start a new life with someone else.  But that would make it harder to hide your current life.  So you use the societal pressure that forced you into your situation to keep her from leaving, stealing decades of her life that she could have potentially had with someone who would have made her happier: There is simply no excuse for this.reply",

      "\u201cOK\u201d is an over-simplified word to use here. It\u2019s incredibly complicated. And it changes with the era and location. If it\u2019s illegal to be gay where you are, or if there literally is no societal understanding of gayness like in the 1700s or whatever where staying a single man is not always an option, I don\u2019t think asking someone to be celibate their entire life is reasonable either. It\u2019s still not _great_ but I don\u2019t blame the individual as much as I do society.Now, the 90s are a different time than the 1700s, and I do think it\u2019s a bit selfish and myopic to think that having affairs in a marriage is your only option. But if I\u2019m being honest, as an out gay person who strongly considered staying in the closet forever, I understand and can empathize.reply",

I am not gay, traditional, chinese or quite as old (probably i am 15 years younger than the gay dad) but i hope i would pull it off as well as he appears to in that situation. He raised only minorly messed up kids, managed to find a little of what his heart felt was love. Biggest fail was not finding a lesbian in the same situation to pull this off together and avoid the lieing and resentment and pain caused to the other partner from a marriage only known to be a sham to one party.reply",

Maybe they even have some small amount of feelings for the spouse or think they can \"learn to love them.\" See Rustin 2023 as an example of the psychology in action.> I'll go to my grave still very sad about the could-have-beens.Sorry for that.

Ultimately this means that yes indeed they could chose to not be gay, but they would have to sacrifice their whole sense of self just to comply with a societal norm.reply"

      "I knew some people that were initially very optimistic, and I tried to keep an open mind when DOGE got started despite the outlandish claims that they would be able to cut $2 trillion dollars from the budget, but it's apparent at this point that the project has been an extreme failure. It'll probably take a few years to really sort out their damage and overall impact though.It's also imperative to mention in every DOGE-related discussion and conversation that the funding freeze to USAID is directly responsible for killing thousands of people [0]. Most of the damage done by DOGE can probably be reversed, but the thousands of death as a direct result of actions taken by the richest man in the world should not be forgotten.

      "I've been a Windows user since 3.1; and I've even defended Microsoft in the past (particularly when they made unpopular choices, but for technically correct reasons, like UAC or forcing vendors to rewrite their drivers into userland or using a safer driver model).BUT, I won't defend Windows 11 and Microsoft's general direction. I feel like there has been a slow cultural shift within Microsoft, from a core of fantastic engineers surrounding by marketing/sales, to the org's direction being set by marketing/sales UX be damned.Plus it feels like a lot of the technical expertise retired out, and left a bunch of engineers scared to touch core systems instead preferring to build on top using Web tech. It means that Windows/Office stopped improving, and have actually both regressed significantly.I've actually found myself recommending MacOS, particularly the prior generation of Macbook Airs which are absurdly powerful with absurd battery life for a fair price. Combine that with the lack of user hostility, and UX, that MacOS brings relative to Windows 11, and it is hard to ignore.reply",

But outside of the processor, what is the last significant leap forward that involved brilliant engineers that you can think of ?One could argue that nothing should change, but that's a lot of missed opportunies (I personally wanted a response to the Surface Pro, and figured out it won't come anytime soon) and we also know that's not how it goes.

NAT can handle tens of thousands of devices, but carriers typically operate many more. Internetworking wonks therefore developed Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), which can handle over 100 devices per IPv4 address and scale to serve millions of users.That\u2019s useful for carriers everywhere, but especially valuable for carriers in those countries that missed out on big allocations of IPv4 because their small pool of available number resources means they must employ CGNAT to handle"
