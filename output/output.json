      "This article is framed as if there is something novel and profound here, but the \"aliveness\" of mitochondria is simply a matter of how we choose to apply the label \"life\" - a human linguistic construct that exists independently of the biological phenomena. This is not a new discussion - science has been considering this question for many decades, just as it has with viruses. These all come down to arguments about semantics and don't add anything to the science.Mitochondria are fascinating and there is still a huge amount to learn about them but they are totally dependent on the cell's machinery. Most of their genes, the code for their structure, are in the nuclear DNA. A glaring omission if you are trying to make the case that mitochondria are independently living. My heart can exist independently of me, and be transplanted into other people, but does it mean that it is alive?The implication of the whole article is that there something we have missed. This really isn't the case. Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria was challenged by many, and it did spark a scientific debate - that's how science works. She won the argument comprehensively decades ago and is well established science. There have been many such endosymbiotic events in the history of life - there are subfields of evolutionary biology that study these processes.\n \nreply",

      "\"Very much alive,\" in the sense of being a living organism in their own right.

Around 2008, Stiver became fascinated by Java decompilation.The Java decompilation landscape was very poor at that time. The first generation of decompilers like JAD or JODE came to an end.

Consequently, once an attacker gains Remote Code Execution (RCE) from these processes, their capabilities are constrained. The next step for the attacker is to circumvent the sandbox to gain enhanced execution capabilities and broader file access permissions.But how to discover sandbox escape vulnerabilities? Upon reviewing the existing issues, I unearthed a significant overlooked attack surface and a novel attack technique.

There are also countries that mainly speak French.- Guyanese are often considered \"Hispanic\" in the U.S. though they are \"Anglo\". In fact Guyanese and Belizeans are able to pick and choose what to indicate on forms regarding their ethnicity, as it suits them.- My favorite Salsa dance teacher in the U.S. has the last name \"Persaud\" and looks \"Latino\".

      "I went through the process of gathering old sources for the games I wrote in that era. Using 68K Mac emulators (BasiliskII for example) I was able to also get the compilers and other dev tools of the era such that I could compile and run from source.Looking through the sources, it was on one hand fun to marvel at the simplicity of the OS (and Mac Toolbox) from that era. I thought it was hard at the time though. Funny how hindsight (and lots and lots more experience) can change how you now see the past.(I see so many cleaner styles of coding I could have adopted - have since adopted - when I look at my old sources.)But I was amazed at how often the apps/OS crashed as I worked through trying to get them up and running within the emulators. At first I thought it was the emulator(s). But my next thought was ... maybe System 6 crashed all the time back then? I think so.Example, I would run ResEdit (a development tool) and open a file that was also open in the IDE (THINK C or THINK Pascal). Crash!Crashes required a reboot (often then requiring running Disk First Aid on the disk image and rebooting again...). I kind of see why Amiga guys laughed at us.In fact I found a few bugs in sources from 35 years ago.\n \nreply",
      "> But I was amazed at how often the apps/OS crashedWhich is one reason why Step 1 after unpacking the computer was to install the \"Programmers Switch\" to get access to the reset button.Rebooting the machine was completely routine. And it wasn't particularly slow (in context, by todays standards, everything was slow, all of those machines were glacial), at least for the time. I don't recall having to ever really run Disk First Aid on anything though.In fact, I remember making a \"toy\" that was a simple app that all it did was bring up the \"Bomb box\" (the infamous dialog with the sizzling bomb an reset button akin to the Blue Screen of Death). The detail was that if you moused to the Reset button in the dialog (which was, essentially an autonomic response for most Mac users), the Reset button would move away from the mouse. So, you \"couldn't\" hit the reset button.There was another button, typically disabled (I think is said Resume or something, I can't recall -- it was always disabled), if you clicked that, it would \"melt\" the screen and exit the app, no harm done.I spent a lot of meticulous time duplicating the dialog box and bomb icon. Run the program, note the box and icon, hit the interrupt button (on the Programmers Switch) to bring up the original, tweak, rinse and repeat.Someone eventually uploaded it to the assorted BBSes.

Still - good ROI on both, got the electronic one because my eyesight is not that good anymore.\n \nreply",
      "With a decent set of vernier calipers (I have Brown and Sharpe ones) they're accurate to 0.001\" (0.02mm) every time. But what's nice about analog measuring tools is you can actually reliably achieve better accuracy--like 0.0005\" +/- 0.00025\"--by \"reading between the lines\". I can reliably take finishing cuts accurately to a few ten thousandths of an inch using vernier calipers (confirmed by checking with a micrometer accurate to 0.0001\").The only application I've encountered where digital tools work better for me is having a DRO on a mill is extremely convenient.\n \nreply",
      "You really want to use a mike on this kind of precision. Calipers can be repeatable in a certain range but even then a readout from vernier gives too much error. Measuring a tenth of mm is acceptable (tho I'd never trust a vernier caliper measurement beyond 0.2). A hundredth IMO is wishful thinking.\n \nreply",

      "In my experience, yes. I've checked with micrometers that are an order of magnitude more precise. You have to be fairly experienced reading it, and it often helps to use a magnifying glass. Also you have to be very careful not to drag the jaws open when removing from the object you're measuring. Taking multiple measurements and averaging helps.To be clear, for a measurement where accuracy to less than 0.001\" actually matters use a micrometer! Otherwise you're likely to screw up the part. But the advertised precision of 0.001\" is totally repeatable within 0.0005\".\n \nreply",
      "tenths and hundredths of an inch \"don't mean anything\" because we don't divide inches that way in common use, but in subtractive manufacturing and the like they do use \"thou\" - and 0.001\" is a thou.Personally, i use microns instead of 0.001mm, too, when measuring that small. I forget the accuracy of my good calipers, but i could detect errors of around 2 microns if memory serves. It's been a long time since i cared about anything that accurate so i have two pairs of cheap plastic ones - scale and digital.\n \nreply",

      "Asterogue is a \"juicy\" graphical coffeebreak roguelike I made that is pretty much directly inspired by the original Rogue in terms of scope and features. You descend 17 levels into the heart of an asteroid to find The Orb and save the universe. There are a bunch of different monsters which get progressively harder as you descend. Instead of magic there is technology and you can pick up nanotech items and beakers of chemicals to buff your character (or hurt them if you get unlucky).I built Asterogue over the course of a couple of months while I was bored on a break from work due to illness. The game was always built with web tech but I only released it on Android and Windows at first because that seemed to be the right way to release a game. Well I recently realized maybe the right way is the wrong way. Maybe this web thing really is catching on. So now I'm trying out a web release to see if I can make it easier for more people to play Asterogue. So far this is working well and the game is getting more daily players than it ever did as a native app, which I'm very grateful for!For the web based version I am trying a new payment model. The original Asterogue was like most other games in that you simply buy it in the app store or on Itch and download the game. This time around I am trying a new experiment with this and instead of buying a downloadable binary, you can play the first few levels free in your browser and then you pay one-time to unlock the full game online if you want to continue. I think this strikes a nice balance for players as you get to try it out and only continue if you're actually into the game once you have picked up the vibe. I haven't really seen this done before with web based games so it's all a bit of an experiment.This release also includes a bunch of fixes and new features based on feedback I received from players after the native version was release.Anyway, I hope you enjoy my little roguelike game.

The first (commercial) languages appeared in the late 1950s, in the guise of Fortran, and Cobol, which were very successful. Work on Algol started in 1958, it was to be a scientific programming language, providing features that Fortran just didn\u2019t, e.g. better structured control, in a package that had roughly the same scope as Fortran, i.e. numerical computation. Algol-58 didn\u2019t really get too far, with emphasis shifting to Algol-60 first implemented by 1960. Algol-60 had a lot going for it, but it seemingly wasn\u2019t enough for the group that produced the 1962 revision of Algol-60. Working Group 2.1 of IFIP wanted a more universal language, one whose scope could include areas covered by Cobol and Lisp, and so they set about extending the language into Algol-X, what would become Algol-68. But Algol-68 wasn\u2019t really a new version of Algol, it was a whole new language. A very complex, and intriguing language, "

      "If you like this, you may find automation project engineer work fun... or at least familiar. Function block diagrams are quite like this: There function blocks are connected together with wires, and the order of operations is defined by block order. Blocks themselves are like builtin functions in the engine, or they can also be composites. The diagram is executed once per control cycle and generally (if no jump blocks exist), each block is always executed exactly once per control cycle regardless of if their inputs have changed or not.And that is how control logic for anything from breweries to petrochemical plants is implemented! Fun stuff! I happen to work on the UI side of an FBD-based control system, so I float around this stuff day-to-day.\n \nreply",

(This is a pair of numbers I've been trying to find forever... static power, and energy to load a bit)Oh... and the programming model, nobody likes plopping logic down on a grid, they try to abstract it away as fast as possible. I don't have sufficient focus to be able to do that bit.[edit] Somewhere in exploring this, I came across Von Neumann cellular automaton[2] and Nobili cellular automata[3], which I've not encountered, despite being interested similar ideas for decades.

The area of each strip doesn\u2019t seem important to solving it:We need to cover the circle as efficiently as possible. That means having exactly one layer of strips. Zero layers doesn\u2019t cover it, and two or more layers are wasted. As soon as you start using strips at different orientations you can\u2019t escape an overlap somewhere.

It is never a wasting time in your life. You learned how the world works!After six years of running bootstrapped businesses, I actually more strongly believe the opposite.It might be true at a high-growth VC-backed startup that you need many stars to align to succeed.In bootstrapped businesses, you basically just need one thing to succeed: product market fit. If you create a product that people want, you'll probably succeed even if you make a lot of other mistakes.With TinyPilot, I didn't know anything about hardware or selling a physical product at the beginning, so I did a million things wrong. But I landed on a product people were willing to pay for, and I found a good way of getting it in front of customers, so the company worked. I did some things right, but for the first year, I mostly felt like revenue was growing on its own and I was trying to keep up.You still need luck to find product market fit because lots of reasonable-sounding ideas end up flopping, but you really just need to get lucky once rather than wait for a whole set of things to get lucky at the same time.\n \nreply",

All parts of this used to be very very public. There are whole presentations, decks, docs, and more. What level you are and what level the person you are talking to ~mattered~. The goal isn't to be a good engineer, to make good products, or anything liek that, but to ONLY do what a nameless committee might want to make that magical number go higher.

Google is so large that I'm definitely willing to believe that there are parts where people are like this, but I found that people generally did not care about my level and while there are many docs/slides about how to get promoted it was largely oriented towards helping people advocate effectively for themselves and was not \"thou shall be promoted\".There was/is the expectation that eventually everyone can reach a certain level within a certain (very generous) amount of time, but I don't see that as the same thing at all.\n \nreply",

IMO every software engineer should be able to get to that point in their career eventually otherwise it indicates a pretty big problem.\n \nreply",
