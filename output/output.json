      "Oh wow - I recently tried 3 Pro preview and it was too slow for me.After reading your comment I ran my product benchmark against 2.5 flash, 2.5 pro and 3.0 flash.The results are better AND the response times have stayed the same.\nWhat an insane gain - especially considering the price compared to 2.5 Pro.\nI'm about to get much better results for 1/3rd of the price. Not sure what magic Google did here, but would love to hear a more technical deep dive comparing what they do different in Pro and Flash models to achieve such a performance.Also wondering, how did you get early access? I'm using the Gemini API quite a lot and have a quite nice internal benchmark suite for it, so would love to toy with the new ones as they come out.reply",
      "Curious to learn what a \u201cproduct benchmark\u201d looks like. Is it evals you use to test prompts/models? A third party tool?Examples from the wild are a great learning tool, anything you\u2019re able to share is appreciated.reply",
      "I'm a significant genAI skeptic.I periodically ask them questions about topics that are subtle or tricky, and somewhat niche, that I know a lot about, and find that they frequently provide extremely bad answers. There have been improvements on some topics, but there's one benchmark question that I have that just about every model I've tried has completely gotten wrong.Tried it on LMArena recently, got a comparison between Gemini 2.5 flash and a codenamed model that people believe was a preview of Gemini 3 flash. Gemini 2.5 flash got it completely wrong. Gemini 3 flash actually gave a reasonable answer; not quite up to the best human description, but it's the first model I've found that actually seems to mostly correctly answer the question.So, it's just one data point, but at least for my one fairly niche benchmark problem, Gemini 3 Flash has successfully answered a question that none of the others I've tried have (I haven't actually tried Gemini 3 Pro, but I'd compared various Claude and ChatGPT models, and a few different open weights models).So, guess I need to put together some more benchmark problems, to get a better sample than one, but it's at least now passing a \"I can find the answer to this in the top 3 hits in a Google search for a niche topic\" test better than any of the other models.Still a lot of things I'm skeptical about in all the LLM hype, but at least they are making some progress in being able to accurately answer a wider range of questions.reply",
      "I don't think tricky niche knowledge is the sweet spot for genai and it likely won't be for some time. Instead, it's a great replacement for rote tasks where a less than perfect performance is good enough. Transcription, ocr, boilerplate code generation, etc.reply",
      "The thing is, I see people use it for tricky niche knowledge all the time; using it as an alternative to doing a Google search.So I want to have a general idea of how good it is at this.I found something that was niche, but not super niche; I could easily find a good, human written answer in the top couple of results of a Google search.But until now, all LLM answers I've gotten for it have been complete hallucinated gibberish.Anyhow, this is a single data point, I need to expand my set of benchmark questions a bit now, but this is the first time that I've actually seen progress on this particular personal benchmark.reply",
      "And Google themselves obviously believe that too as they happily insert AI summaries at the top of most serps now.reply",
      "Or maybe Google knows most people search inane, obvious things?reply",
      "Or more likely Google couldn't give a rat's arse whether those AI summaries are good or not (except to the degree that people don't flee it), and what it cares is that they keep users with Google itself, instead of clicking of to other sources.After all it's the same search engine team that didn't care about its search results - it's main draw - activey going shit for over a decade.reply",

      "It's interesting that the most effective organism they discovered is a facultative anaerobe, which can survive with or without oxygen.According to Gemini: Cancer tissue isn't completely devoid of oxygen, but it's often severely oxygen-deprived (hypoxic), especially in the core of solid tumors where rapid growth outpaces the blood supply, forcing cancer cells to adapt to low oxygen for survival and spread, making hypoxia a key feature of cancer biology.Could it be that this organism switches to anaerobic respiration when it finds itself inside cancer tissue, and under these conditions it produces anti-cancer metabolites ?

      "I was a Udemy instructor for ~10 years selling tech courses but focused more on delivering courses through my own site for the last ~5-6 years.Something never felt right with how Udemy promoted courses. I used to have a top selling course there, selling thousands of copies a month and now it gets basically no sales but it's still one of the highest rated courses in that niche on their platform. It's just no longer ranked or promoted by Udemy, for years.I have no evidence of this but my personal opinion is their ranking is probably not fully automated and they have special offers and deals with certain instructors and if you're not a part of this club, oh well.Again, it's all speculation but I can only go by what my numbers are. They were small scale life changing and now nothing but the quality of the courses I produced didn't change. It doesn't make sense.

      "Modern society totally devalues anything considered even slightly old.  I used to notice it as a real lack of intergenerational knowledge transfer, but it's gotten so bad that it seems like more and more people react with \"how do you know so much?\" and \"why would you do that?\" over very basic knowledge that isn't even that old.  For all the reading the average person claims to do, they sure don't seem to know very much outside of a 10-year window unless they happen to have studied history in college or whatever.But I don't necessarily blame said people, at least in the proximal sense.  The technological industrial complex continuously refines its understanding of the desire for novelty that's always been there and seeks to exploit it; and they've gotten unreasonably good at that.  It doesn't matter if your intellectual property is just as relevant as ever, perhaps more so, if there's some hip new alternative.  Udemy and of course social media sites know this, and I think there's a feedback loop that goes beyond mere exploitation of the human psyche, but in the actual training of the human psyche to have blindness towards the past.The only answer right now, besides hosting your own courses (with hookers and blackjack), might be to periodically recreate your online presence from scratch in order to exploit the algorithm back.

      "The thing people miss in these \u201creplace juniors with AI\u201d takes is that juniors were never mainly about cheap hands on keyboards. They\u2019re the only people in the org who are still allowed to ask \u201cdumb\u201d questions without losing face, and those questions are often the only signal you get that your abstractions are nonsense.What AI does is remove a bunch of the humiliating, boring parts of being junior: hunting for the right API by cargo-culting Stack Overflow, grinding through boilerplate, getting stuck for hours on a missing import. If a half-decent model can collapse that search space for them, you get to spend more of their ramp time on \u201chere\u2019s how our system actually fits together\u201d instead of \u201chere\u2019s how for-loops work in our house style\u201d.If you take that setup and then decide \u201ccool, now we don\u2019t need juniors at all\u201d, you\u2019re basically saying you want a company with no memory and no farm system \u2013 just an ever-shrinking ring of seniors arguing about strategy while no one actually grows into them.Always love to include a good AI x work thread in my https://hackernewsai.com/ newsletter.reply",

      "Yep, I fully agree with this view and I find that it's seniors who ask the 'dumb' questions. Everyone is worried about losing face in this precarious economy... But seniors are able to ask really smart questions as well so even their dumb questions sound smart... They can usually spin dumb questions into a smart questions by going one level deeper and bringing nuance into the discussion. This may be difficult to do for a junior.My experience as a team lead working with a lot of juniors is that they are terrified of losing face and tend to talk a big game. As a team lead, I try to use language which expresses any doubts or knowledge gaps I have so that others in my team feel comfortable doing it as well. But a key aspect is that you have to really know your stuff in certain areas because  you need to inspire others to mirror you... They won't try to mirror you if they don't respect you, based on your technical ability.You need to demonstrate deep knowledge in some areas and need to demonstrate excellent reasoning abilities before you can safely ask dumb questions IMO. I try to find the specific strengths and weaknesses of my team members. I give constructive criticism for weaknesses but always try to identify and acknowledge each person's unique superpower; what makes them really stand out within the team. If people feel secure in their 'superpower', then they can be vulnerable in other areas and still feel confident. It's important to correctly identify the 'superpower' though because you don't want a Junior honing a skill that they don't naturally possess or you don't want them to be calling shots when they should be asking for help.reply",

At one company, my quarterly feedback was that I don\u2019t ask too many questions in meetings, which was mostly due to the fact that the project was pretty straightforward and requirements were hammered down on a document. In another company, asking questions got me the feedback that I was maybe not experienced enough to manage the project by myself, which I was completely capable of. It\u2019s a double edged sword.But yes on a personal level, being senior enough in my career, I\u2019d rather be thought of as less skilled by asking questions before the s hits the fan, than execute and mismanage a project that I didn\u2019t ask enough questions on.

      "Hi, I work at Docker. Really appreciate the thoughtful discussion here. We\u2019re excited to make Hardened Images free and open because we believe secure-by-default should be the starting point for every developer, not something you bolt on later.A big part of this for us is transparency. That\u2019s why every image ships with VEX statements, extensive attestations, and all the metadata you need to actually understand what you\u2019re running. We want this to be a trustworthy foundation, not just a thinner base image.We\u2019re also extending this philosophy beyond base images into other content like MCP servers and related components, because the more of the stack that is verifiable and hardened by default, the better it is for the ecosystem.A few people in the thread asked how this is sustainable. The short answer is that we do offer an enterprise tier for companies that need things like contractual continuous patching SLAs, regulated-industry variants (FIPS, etc.), and secure customizations with full provenance and attestations. Those things carry very real ongoing costs, so keeping them in Enterprise allows us to make the entire hardened catalog free for the community.Glad to see the conversation happening here. We hope this helps teams ship software with a stronger security posture and a bit more confidence.reply",
      "Wow, \"hardened image\" market is getting saturated. I saw atleast 3 companies offering this at Kubecon.Chainguard came to this first (arguably by accident since they had several other offerings before they realized that people would pay (?!!) for a image that reported zero CVEs).In a previous role, I found that the value for this for startups is immense. Large enterprise deals can quickly be killed by a security team that that replies with \"scanner says no\". Chainguard offered images that report 0 CVEs and would basically remove this barrier.For example, a common CVE that I encountered was a glibc High CVE. We could pretty convincingly show that our app did not use this library in way to be vulnerable but it didn't matter. A high CVE is a full stop for most security teams. Migrated to a Wolfi image and the scanner reported 0. Cool.But with other orgs like Minimus (founders of Twistlock) coming into this it looks like its about to be crowded.There is even a govt project called Ironbank to offer something like this to the DoD.Net positive for the ecosystem but I don't know if there is enough meat on the bone to support this many vendors.reply",
      "The real question isn't whether the market is saturated, it's whether it still exists once Docker gives away the core value prop for free.reply",
      "Most likely yes. There are a lot enterprises out there that only trust paid subscriptions.Paying for something \u201csecure\u201d comes with the benefit of risk mitigation - we paid X to give us a secure version of Y, hence its not our fault \u201cbad thing\u201d happenned.reply",
      "Counterpoint: most likely no, it really is about all the downstream impacts of critical and high findings in scanners.  The risk of failing a soc2 audit for example.  Once that risk is removed then the value prop is also removed.reply",
      "Yep differentiation is tricky here. Chainguard are expanding out to VM images and programming language repos, but the core of hardened container images has a lot of options.The question I'd be interested in is, outside of markets where there's a lot of compliance requirements, how much demand is there for this as a paid service...People like lower CVE images, but are they willing to pay for them. I guess that's an advantage for Docker's offering. If it's free there is less friction to trying it out compared to a commercial offering.reply",
      "Depends what type of shop. If you're in a big dinosaur org and you 'roll your own' that ends up having a vulnerability, you get fired. If you pay someone else and it ends up having a vulnerability you get to blame it on the vendor.reply",
      "Perhaps in theory, but I\u2019d be willing to wager that most dinosaur orgs have so many unpatched vulns, they would need to fire everyone in their IT org to cover just the criticalsreply",
      "> There is even a govt project called Ironbank to offer something like this to the DoD.Note that you don't have to be DoD to use Iron Bank images. They are available to other organizations too, though you do have to sign up for an account.reply",
      "It's free for now, just like registries were \"free\" and docker desktop was free.. until they weren't. I am not against Docker capitalizing and charging for their services (as they should); however, the pattern of offering a service for free and then reneging after it's widely adopted, makes me hesitant to adopt any of their offerings.reply"

The education-mortality gradient has increased sharply in the last three decades, with the life-expectancy gap between people with and without a college degree widening from 2.6 years in 1992 to 6.3 years in 2019 (Case and Deaton 2023). During the same period, mortality inequality across counties rose 30 percent, accompanied by an increasing rural health penalty. Using county- and state-level data from the 1992\u20132019 period, we demonstrate that these three trends arose due to a fundamental shift in the geographic patterns of mortality among college and non-college populations. First, we find a sharp decline in both mortality rates and geographic inequality for college graduates. Second, the reverse was true for people without a college degree; spatial inequality became amplified. Third, we find that rates of smoking play a key role in explaining all three empirical puzzles, with secondary roles attributed to income, other health behaviors, and state policies.

      "Over a decade ago, the maintainer of SQLite gave a talk at OSCON about their testing practices. One concept that stood out to me was the power of checklists, the same tool pilots rely on before every flight.He also mentioned Doctors Without Borders, who weren't seeing the outcomes they expected when it came to saving lives. One surprising reason? The medical teams often didn't speak the same language or even know each other's names.The solution was simple: a pre-surgery checklist. Before any procedure, team members would state their name and role. This small ritual dramatically improved their success rates, not through better technique, but through better communication.https://sqlite.org/src/ext/checklist/3070700/indexreply",
      "On the other hand, I think this narrative also causes a lot of useless red tape. There might be some survivorship bias here.Aviation, Doctors Without Borders, and SQLite have good checklists. Checklists are simple, so it's easy to think \"oh I could do that too\". But you never hear about the probably endless companies and organizations that employ worthless checklists that do nothing but waste people's time.I wish there was more talk about what makes a checklist good or bad. I suspect it's kind of like mathematics where the good formulas look very simple but are very hard to discover without prior knowledge.reply",
      "I've always found an enormous amount of good practices (not just engineering ones) in aircraft operations and engineering that would be applicable to software engineering.I've always day dreamed of an IT organization that combined those with the decision-making procedures and leadership of modern armies, such as the US Army one.I've re-read multiple times FM22-100 which I find strikingly modern and inspiring:https://armyoe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1990-fm-22-100...While I do understand that business leadership cannot compare to the high standards of those required by way more important stakes, I think there's many lessons to learn there too.reply",
      "In some areas, I absolutely agree... I think when it comes to vehicles, medical devices and heavy equipment, it would be better to see much more rigorous practices in terms of software craftsmanship.  I think it should be very similar in financial operations (it isn't) and most govt work in general (it isn't).In the end, for most scenarios, break fast, fix fast is likely a more practical and cost effective approach.reply",

Z, then you will have a better understanding of the state of the system you work with . If something goes wrong, at least the bits you checked can be disregarded and free you to check other factors. What if your systems correctly report a faulty issue, yet your automatic checklist doesn't catch it?Also, this manual checklist checks the operator.You should be automating everything you can, but much care should be put into figuring out if you can actually automate a particular thing.Automate away the process to deploy a new version of hn, what's the worst that can happen?But don't automate the pre flight checklist, if something goes wrong while the plane is in the air, people are going to die.I think a less verbose version of the above is that a human can detect a fault in a sensor, while a sensor can't detect it is faulty itself.reply"

It's quite easy to run if you're interested!reply",
      "I am not sure how it compares but I did use one idea from Cassio's talk on Teju:> A more interesting improvement comes from a talk by Cassio Neri Fast Conversion From Floating Point Numbers. In Schubfach, we look at four candidate numbers. The first two, of which at most one is in the rounding interval, correspond to a larger decimal exponent. The other two, of which at least one is in the rounding interval, correspond to the smaller exponent. Cassio\u2019s insight is that we can directly construct a single candidate from the upper bound in the first case.reply",
      "Indeed! I saw that you linked to Neri's work, so you were aware of Teju Jagu\u00e1. I might make a pull request to add it to the benchmark repo when I have some time :)Another nice thing about your post is mentioning the \"shell\" of the algorithm, that is, actually translating the decimal significand and exponent into a string (as opposed to the \"core\", turning f * 2^e into f' * 10^e'). A decent chunk of the overall time is spent there, so it's worth optimising it as well.reply",
