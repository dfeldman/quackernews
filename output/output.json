      "I've been a full-time FEM Analyst for 15 years now. It's generally a nice article, though in my opinion paints a far rosier picture of the last couple decades than is warranted.Actual, practical use of FEM has been stagnate for quite some time. There have been some nice stability improvements to the numerical algorithms that make highly nonlinear problems a little easier; solvers are more optimized; and hardware is of course dramatically more capable (flash storage has been a godsend).Basically every advanced/\"next generation\" thing the article touts has fallen flat on its face when applied to real problems. They have some nice results on the world's simplest \"laboratory\" problem, but accuracy is abysmal on most real-world problems - e.g. it might give good results on a cylinder in simple tension, but fails horribly when adding bending.There's still nothing better, but looking back I'm pretty surprised I'm still basically doing things the same way I was as an Engineer 1; and not for lack of trying. I've been on countless development projects that seem promising but just won't validate in the real world.Industry focus has been far more on Verification and Validation (ASME V&V 10/20/40) which has done a lot to point out the various pitfalls and limitations. Academic research and the software vendors haven't been particularly keen to revisit the supposedly \"solved\" problems we're finding.\n \nreply",

      "EV software engineer here.Your hypothesis is basically correct. Since the motor is under no load, it will appear to spin out of control even with the smallest torque application, but in reality the torque being applied is very small\u2026 probably around 5Nm.Trust me if it was truly spinning out of control with no load you\u2019d know\u2026 it would reach max speed in 0.1 seconds and probably start tearing through the floor.Most likely what\u2019s happening is that the creep torque is applying a constant small torque and the wheel sensors are reading 0 continuously, so it continues to apply a constant small torque.\n \nreply",
      "Hey! Post author here.I appreciate the insight from someone who's worked on this kind of thing formally, thanks.> Most likely what\u2019s happening is that the creep torque is applying a constant small torque and the wheel sensors are reading 0 continuously, so it continues to apply a constant small torque.This was also my hypothesis at the time of the post. Turned out it's less constrained than this, a fully operational car with the drive wheels off the ground will also run away to high rpm (even in Neutral): https://www.projectgus.com/2024/04/unremarkable/#on-car-test...There's still minimal torque, as you say, so a small press on the car's brake pedal is all it takes to stop. However I think if a driveshaft broke on a real car then it'd be spinning fast for a minute or two... It kind of makes sense that the control loop is tuned for a heavy car with a fixed drive ratio, though.I am still hopeful there will be a way to stop this behaviour via a control signal (rather than pulling the safety interlock and slamming the contactors open). Have left the problem aside until I have a mechanical brake to use for testing! If that doesn't work out then it's still usable I think, provided any EV conversion is single speed fixed gear just like the Kona.If you have any other insights on this then I'd be very interested to hear them, though.\n \nreply",

      "This project is awesome! Using Google Apps Script for an appointment link is such a clever idea\u2014just the right balance of simplicity and functionality.Google Apps Script is such an underrated tool. I use it all the time to link up different services, and it\u2019s truly \u201cserverless\u201d in a way that makes sense. No added complexity\u2014just webhook handling and periodic tasks, which is usually all I need to sync ticket systems with Slack, pull in data from Sentry, and so on. Plus, it\u2019s straightforward, no extra layers to worry about. LLMs are actually pretty handy for getting these scripts going too.I use Google Calendar\u2019s scheduling and think it\u2019s great, but it does have limits. I still have to scrape calendar events to keep an ongoing list in a spreadsheet, which helps for billing clients by month. Google Apps Script makes all this work reliably without extra cost or maintenance.There are other options, sure, but asking someone to set up PostgreSQL, Next.js, or Docker just for a personal scheduling link seems like overkill. For a solution that just works without needing constant attention, Apps Script is more than enough.\n \nreply",

Dashboards for each customer that reflect THE SAME numbers as we generate in #1, so customers could see relevant info quicker than just waiting for the bill from #1The only reason those things were valued and made a focus though was because a HUGE customer threatened to completely drop our company because that customer did an audit and noticed that we had overcharged them 3% because we were actually billing them on estimated numbers. That led to our CEO being personally yelled at by a much larger CEO, and our CEO (to his credit) didn't blame us (we'd raised the alarms that the bills were estimates and not auditable) but did say \"this can never happen again, I trust you, do whatever needs to happen to make sure this never happens again.\"And once we had #1 solid and tight, we were able to leverage that solid auditable data to generate solid dashboard numbers that always squared with what showed on the bill.\n \nreply",

At a high level all he had to do for basic thermography was to flat-field the raw image with offsets acquired from the camera's shutter, without even having to derive per-pixel gains like you normally would, and mask out some bad pixels (and inpaint them for na\u00efve consumers that can't handle NA data).  Then as a bonus he implemented lock-in thermography, which turns out to be just lock-in amplification applied to thermography by modulating a heat source over time.But the technical detail provided seems to be enough to make it easy for someone else to reproduce the whole setup.

This camera is regarded as worse than the \"V1\" mostly because the manufacturer removed the internal processing FPGA?That's actually better. In-camera processing will just reduce the amount of information you can get out of the sensor. For example, even if it does exactly the same flat-fielding as you do, the in-camera flat-fielded image has to be requantized to 8-bit format before sending to the computer, therefore losing precision.You can get even better accuracy by taking a dark or bias field (might be possible if you can set the exposure time to something very short, but this might not be possible with these thermographic cameras) and taking flatfields at different temperatures, so you can get per-pixel linearity curves. That's a lot of work though, and ideally each camera was indiviually calibrated by the producer, but I am guessing that is not done for these cheap cameras.\n \nreply",
