      "Without getting into the specifics of their arguments, it's striking to me how out of touch Martin seems to be with the realities of software engineering in this transcript. Stylistic refactors that induce performance regressions, extremely long and tortured method names for three-line methods, near-total animus towards comments ... regardless of who is right/wrong about what, those takes seem like sophomoric extremism at its worst, not reasoned pragmatism that can be applied to software development in the large.When I encounter an Uncle Bob devotee, I'm nearly always disappointed with the sheer rigidity of their approach: everything must be reduced thus, into these kind of pieces, because it is Objectively Better software design, period. Defaults and best practices are well and good, but the amount of dogma that comes up is super disappointing.I worry that this approach allows a certain kind of programmer to focus on like ... aesthetic, dogmatic uniformity (and the associated unproductivity of making primarily aesthetically-motivated, dogmatic changes rather than enhancements, bugfixes, or things that other coders on a project agree improves maintainability) instead of increasing their skills and familiarity with their craft. Maintainability/appropriate factoring are subjective qualities that depend a lot on the project, the other programmers on it, and the expectations around how software engineering is done in that environment. Pretending that that's not true and a uniform \"one clean code style to rule them all\" is a viable approach does everyone involved a disservice.\n \nreply",

      "In case the other responses to your question are a little difficult to parse, and to answer your question a little more directly:- Usually, you will only get analytic answers for simple questions about simple distributions.- For more complicated problems (either because the question is complicated, or the distribution is complicated, or both), you will need to use numerical methods.- This doesn't necessarily mean you'll need to do many simulations, as in a Monte Carlo method, although that can be a very reasonable (albeit expensive) approach.More direct questions about certain probabilities can be answered without using a Monte Carlo method. The Fokker-Planck equation is a partial differential equation which can be solved using a variety of non-Monte Carlo approaches. The quasipotential and committor functions are interesting objects which come up in the simulation of rare events that can also be computed \"directly\" (i.e., without using a Monte Carlo approach). The crux of the problem is that applying standard numerical methods to the computation of these objects faces the curse of dimensionality. Finding good ways to compute these things in the high-dimensional case (or even the infinite-dimensional case) is a very hot area of research in applied mathematics. Personally, I think unless you have a very clear physical application where the mathematics map cleanly onto what you're doing, all this stuff is probably a bit of a waste of time...\n \nreply",

      "> The decrease is almost entirely due to gains in lighting efficiency in households, and particularly the transition from incandescent (and compact fluorescent) light bulbs to LED light bulbsI am reminded of Jevons paradox:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradoxI replaced all of my incandescent and fluorescent lighting with LEDs years ago. A decent amount of the hypothetical savings from more efficient lighting was eaten by having even more lumens than previously as quality of light upgrades. Despite that, I did not notice much of a difference since my household had been keeping the lights off unless we needed them.There was a minor dip in the electric bill from other initiatives (e.g. heat pump dryer) and my solar panels started producing more than my household used. I had relatively few computers (general purpose; not counting embedded) running in my home compared to others in computing for years to try to keep this trend. In the past few years, I got an electric car and replaced my oil heat with heat pumps. Now my solar panels only produce about 60% of the electricity I use and I have given up on limiting usage to match what I produce.Anyway, no matter how many efficiency initiatives people adopt, electricity usage is likely to increase rather than drop. That is because we not only find new uses for electricity, but the population keeps growing.\n \nreply",
      "Electricity use went up in your case, but switching from oil heat and an internal combustion car to heat pumps and an EV should mean that your overall energy use has gone down fairly significantly (down to 1/3 or 1/4 of the energy used on heating and driving).So that's not quite the Jevons paradox unless you're going to drive three times the distance or expand to heating four times as much space in your house.\n \nreply",

While the total energy pie is decreasing (for now), the marketshare of electricity should be increasing.When there is no more energy usage to move to electric cars and heat pumps (and no more production to move to China), I would expect energy usage to start increasing again.

A picture is worth 1,000 words, and an experience is worth 100,000 pictures - you can't really convey it in pictures. As a result, I 'just try things' whenever I have the opportunity, and my learning rate has increased dramatically.There are two questions about efficiency upgrades:How much power do you use compared to the alternative? It may increase, but more efficiency means it increases less than the alternative.How much power do you use absolutely?

      "My household energy usage has decreased, but my household electricity usage continues to rise.In the early days, our heating oil usage was 1000 gallons per year. Efficiency initiatives reduced that to about 430 gallons per year. 1000 gallons is about 41MWh. 430 gallons is about 17MWh. Going to the heat pump has me using about 7MWh extra electricity per year, while yearly electricity usage had been around 11 MWh per year (with 10 MWh produced by solar). This does not count the car, for which the numbers would be even more skewed by life changes since I drove about 1 to 2 orders of magnitude more when I was in college.Depending on how you decide to do the accounting, my household\u2019s total energy usage dropped by 65% (if we count the oil usage reductions on top of the heat pump) or by 35% (if we count only the heat pump), without even counting the solar panels. Still, my electricity usage has never been higher.If you were to try to cook my books so to speak, you could say my household\u2019s total energy usage has decreased by 85% with a electricity usage decrease of 27%, by treating the energy from the solar panels as if it were free. I do not think that is a correct way of doing accounting (although it could be a matter of opinion).By the way, remarks on climate change could encourage people to claim unrealistic improvements in personal/household energy usage, such as the figures I gave for what I could claim if we \u201ccooked the books\u201d. Of the various figures I gave, I think the 35% reduction in total energy usage is the most honest figure.

      "> The decrease is almost entirely due to gains in lighting efficiency in households...The article is an interesting treatment of how lighting is getting more efficient and well worth a read. But pedantically zooming in on this one throwaway phrase for a second... this is a misinterpretation of the data on 2 levels.1) The (badly labelled) graph seems to be displaying a very very slight linear uptrend for \"residential\".2) Energy is literally the first example of where we expect to see Jevons paradox [0]. If its use is going down, that is because energy is getting more expensive in real terms. If the only trend here was lighting getting more efficient, households on aggregate would find ways to use more electricity because it is extremely fungible.By default the proper way to interpret the data (if for the sake of argument I say what I would interpret as a slight uptrend is actually a downtrend) is that electricity is getting more expensive real terms. The impact that has on living standards is cushioned somewhat by improvements in lighting efficiency. But if electricity costs were steady and lighting efficiency improved we'd expect to see an increase in electricity use.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox\n \nreply",
      "> Jevons paradoxThat depends on the demand elasticity of the thing in question. If everyone already had about all the lights they wanted in their homes (a somewhat reasonable assumption, give or take a proportion of families turning off lights religiously), making them cheaper wouldn't make you go out and buy more lights -- certainly not enough to make up for the cheaper cost.Stated somewhat differently, when you switched from incandescents to LEDs, did you add more or less than 8x the total lumens to your home? I'm guessing quite a bit less. My apartment is a little small, but I couldn't manage 8x if I doubled the brightness in every room and always left every light on. No lighting efficiency improvements are going to convince me to go beyond that threshold.The point about households on aggregate finding ways to use more electricity doesn't apply because it's not power those houses now have in comparative excess, but rather dollars -- you don't have to buy as much power to do the things you want, so you have more dollars and can choose to spend them on additional electricity consumption or massively inflated rent or a vacation or whatever. The _unit cost_ of electricity (note that Jevons paradox applies to unit costs, not substituted goods or alternative sources of income or savings) didn't change by making lighting more efficient (and, as you've noted, has gotten more expensive), so you're not incentivized more than you already were to spend those dollars on electricity consumption instead of other things you could buy instead.\n \nreply",
      "I think this just doesn't come to terms with how much more efficient modern lights are?I remember when folks were resisting LED lights at the start.  Folks would literally promote turning off the lights earlier to save energy.  Remember back when making sure the lights were out was a big deal?Turns out, 60-100 watts down to 10 is just ridiculously hard to come terms with.  Turn off the lights early just doesn't compete.  Not even close.This also ignores how much more efficient other things are.  Televisions would be an amusing one.  It isn't as dramatic, sure, but it is about a quarter of the energy?\n \nreply"

I'm not sure what the implementation would look like to define sorting the algorithm to organize the \"close\" rows together, how the metadata would be calculated, or what the reader implementation would look like, but I'd love to be able to implement some of the same patterns with vector search as with geoparquet.\n \nreply",

Not about to share it anywhere.But, they both look like mostly honest perspectives from particular types of people.I see the first one and think of all the out of touch HS teachers I had who were so convinced their class was important and they were going to teach me an important life lesson and save me from underachieving by being hard on me in some way (usually being super strict on deadlines, or the guy who let me turn in my test with the back side not complete and didn't tell me or let me retry for partial credit - both my fault, but they taught me nothing). They had no concern for the fact I was just trying to get through the day. They just saw someone with potential who needed to learn from their mistakes by being held accountable. But I had missed deadlines in every class I ever took since middle school, if I could have just taught myself executive functioning and how to have a stable home life, I would have.The second reminds me of a lot of some of my friends. They are anxious wrecks, obsessesing over the news constantly, meanwhile compulsively using social media to make calls for action and bring important things that they can't really actually impact to light. All the while, their personal life and mental health is a wreck, which they also loudly proclaim on social media.So I think both poems were great insights into those perspectives. It's just that those perspectives are not exactly interesting and are sometimes a bit annoying.\n \nreply",

      "From glancing through a few of the pages that piqued my interest, I was somewhat surprised to see this section in \"How to Execute Types\" (https://vekatze.github.io/neut/how-to-execute-types.html):> Here, we'll see how a type is translated into a function that discards/copies the terms of the type. To see the basic idea, let's take a simple ADT for example:    data item {\n    | New(int, int)\n    }\n\n> The internal representation of New(10, 20) is something like the below:> New(10, 20)    // \u2193 (compile)\n\n    let v = malloc({2-words}) in\n    store(10, v[0]);\n    store(20, v[1]);\n    v\n\nI suspected that it's not actually heap-allocating every single bit of memory in every program, and from looking around more in the docs, I _think_ the \"Allocation Canceling\" section here explains what I was missing (https://vekatze.github.io/neut/basis.html#allocation-canceli...):> When a free is required, Neut looks for a malloc that is the same size and optimizes away such a pair if one exists.This is a really interesting way of automating memory management at compile time. I imagine there's still a lot of room for different choices in this strategy (e.g. choosing to reuse part of a larger allocation rather than looking for one that's exactly the same size and then leaving behind the remainder to re-use for a future allocation), and I'm super curious about whether this would end up encouraging different patterns than existing memory management systems. Offhand, it almost seems like it could act as a built-in allocation buffer managed by the compiler, and I'm curious if the algorithm for reusing memory is smart enough to handle something like manually allocating the maximum amount of memory needed for the lifetime of the program up front and then re-using that for the duration of the program to avoid needing to allocate anything dynamically at all (although my worry would be that this would devolve into the knapsack problem and not be feasible in practice). If this did work though, my immediate idea would be for some sort of hook where you could specify the maximum amount of memory you'd be willing to use, which could then turn \"using too much memory at runtime\" into a compiler error. My assumption is that that I'm missing something that would make all of this not work the way I'm thinking though.\n \nreply",

Instead, it takes a type-directed approach to handle resources.Like the following:Neut translates a type into a function that can discard/copy the values of the type. By using those functions, the compiler translates programs so that every variable is used exactly once.For example, if a variable is used twice, a translation like the following will happen:If you need more, see How to Execute Types.You may wonder: \"So we need to, for example, copy the whole list just to get its length? Isn't it the end of the world?\". This topic is covered in Static Memory Management. As written there, Neut avoids such copyings by using the T-necessity operator in modal logic to achieve something like borrowing in Rust.Please see the benchmarks.You might also find Neut's module system interesting.

      "Awesome project!As someone deeply familiar with this problem (ex-JupiterOne), I'd caution against asserting that 'deep level of customization' is a differentiator. Your buyer (CISO) and userbase (Sec Engs) are drowning. They (and I) don't want yet another product to build on top of. This is a key reason why Wiz is so successful -- an operator can turn Wiz on and immediately receive value, no adjustments or additions needed.I'd strategically focus on making the 'actionability' part the cornerstone of the product and really become obsessed with making that part of your product incredible. The Goliath-killing story you need will be formed by figuring out how to get your product to the point where someone can turn it on and immediately receive value for the most impactful security problems first (ex: Log4J) and the total surface area of problems the product solves for second.\n \nreply",

Figure out how to actually solve problems in an automated/semi-automated way and ship that instead.The other issue with all of these tools is handling onboarding/integrations and getting terrible visibility as a result. A big market gap I see is a tool that can use the vulnerabilities it discovers to further information collection just like a real attacker would. Found Splunk creds in a log?

This past weekend I was playing around with something where if I clicked on a SecretsManagerSecret node then it'd give me the CLI commands to assume the roles and then retrieve the secret. It'd be neat to take it a step further and be able to click here and get a shell -- I don't think we're _that_ far off from that (but for now to be very clear we're focusing on read-only actions only since a security tool with permissions to do scary things in your environment kinda defeats the purpose).\n \nreply",

This is configurable too; here's the set of the default permission relationships shipped in OSS: https://github.com/cartography-cncf/cartography/blob/master/...It doesn't cover conditions since those can be wacky complicated, and it doesn't cover resource policies (yet!) but in my experience this is still a very good heuristic that is already more accurate than AWS IAM Analyzer when I played with it.The next step we're working on is to take this access map and correlate it with event data to see which permissions are used/unused so that we can prune them for ensuring least privilege.

Figure it out, it's 100% not the consumer's problem.And they're arguably NOT arguments at all, as doing something to make your product less repairable is generally MORE expensive that NOT doing that thing. Most of the time in product manufacture, costs come from performing actions, so by not performing actions, those costs go away. That's what these laws are usually about, skipping repair-unfriendly design choices, making repair documents available (that's free, they already exist, companies need not keep them secret/internal), and not creating software locks that are only for keeping out \"unauthorized\" repairs.Apple could save money by using all hex/phillips screws and doing away with pentalobe screws as they'd have few different items to buy and use. Apple could save a really good deal of money using NVMe drives, or an open standard for flash-chip boards like in the M4 Mini, because currently they waste a lot of engineering resources on their proprietary solutions. Devices with ultrasonically welded plastic cases could skip the ultrasonic welding step and just use clips on the plastic frame. Etc.\n \nreply",
      "It\u2019s also difficult to quantify the true savings of repair (true cost of garbage, shipping protection, etc), incentives punish local work, and the cost of losing local knowledge and know-how.I wouldn\u2019t call what you mentioned as reasonable, but nobody with the financial muscle or brain power wants to do that deep dive analysis.\n \nreply",
      "It needs to be explicitly shown how and why it increases costs because if anything it feels like the opposite to me, especially when companies use proprietary pieces and hiding schematics rather than open standards and common configurations.\n \nreply",
      "fewer sold products, less economy of scale, more cost\n \nreply",
      "Botched repair then 3 iterations of resale to obfuscate it was originally repaired badly could dilute brand strength, but that's kind of a stretch\n \nreply",
      "> reasonableIf your net worth is high enough that anti-consumer policy pumps your assets harder than it dumps your consumption, it's rational. A huge jerk move, sure, and arguably unreasonable on those grounds, but it's rational. Unfortunately the $600B sponsor and $6B president are faaaar on the other side of the invisible net worth boundary where that starts to be the case, so I wouldn't expect RtR to get much traction, but who knows. There is enough chaos to make it worth a try even if it \"ought\" to fail on grounds of \"government by the rich, for the rich.\"\n \nreply",

Today, that movement has touched every corner of the country. Lawmakers in every state in the union have filed legislation demanding access to the parts, tools, and documentation we need for repair. This year alone, legislation is active in 24 states.\u00a0Some of those laws have passed: Five states (New York, California, Minnesota, Oregon, and Colorado) have passed electronics Right to Repair legislation. One in five Americans lives in a state that has passed Right to Repair\u2014and the remaining states are working hard to restore repair competition.\u201cHere, there and everywhere\u2014people just want to fix their stuff,\u201d sa"
