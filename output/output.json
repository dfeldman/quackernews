I'd be more comfortable if they had default member initialisers, i.e., \"int x = 0; int y = 0;\" in FooArgs.It took me a while to see why they bothered to have a string template parameter for TypedArg in the first usage.

(Not sure what the english version for a daughter is).Had some Icelandic friends in school (which still has patronymic names, moved here after they were born), and it was for them somewhat problematic at times that the siblings had different surnames (Bj\u00f6rnsdottir and Bj\u00f6rnsson), as people don't assume they're family, and especially not that the parents both had different surnames again.

(Note that this algorithm does eliminate matrilineal names, because a child will effectively be receiving their two surnames from their grandfathers.From what I understand, if the genetic lineage is particularly elite, you might keep more. My wife grew up in Latin America among the Hispanic elite, and apparently some of her friends had more than two surnames because their bloodlines were extremely blue and they wanted to preserve reference to the lineage.This is a bit like how Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's kids have the surname Mountbatten-Windsor.

It\u2019s impressive they saw such good results from that, but I wonder if they could get better results by incorporating recent efficiency improvements.I would personally not use this architecture because 1) it adds a lot of hyperparameters which don\u2019t have a strong theoretical grounding and 2) it\u2019s not clearly better than simpler methods.\n \nreply",

I made a tool to visualise how characters were laid out on the page and bounding boxes of all the elements.The project was in the end a complete failure and several people were upset at me for not delivering what I was supposed to.In present day, with the capabilities that are now available with LLMs to extract data from PDFs I 100% would go the route of utilising AI to extract the data they wanted. Back then that did not yet exist.\n \nreply",

The key is to use rule based engine and references to cross check the data.\n \nreply",
      "The LLMs might help with sequencing the characters you extract from the page but actually getting the contents is still difficult. A number of times I've come across a page where the letters of the text are glyphs in a custom font with no mapping to ascii or anything similar or even more common, especially with output from CAD, are letters that are made by drawing lines in the shape of letters so there is nothing identifiable to extract and you are left with OCRing the page to double check the results\n \nreply",

Everything from the After-Visit Summary from the doctor, to your car registration document already has a specific visual representation chosen to allow them to fit sensibly and precisely on sheets of paper.Could HTML (say, with data URLs for its images and CSS so that it can stand on its own), or ePub be a better format in most ways? Sort of, but it is optimized for such a different goal that if you went in to evangelize that switch to everyone who makes PDFs today, you'd be met with frustration that the content will look a bit different on every device, and that depending on settings, even the page breaks would fall differently.Relatedly, it's interesting to me that even Google Docs, which I suspect are printed or converted to PDF far less than half the time, defaults to the \"paged\" mode (see Page Setup) that shows document page borders and margins, instead of the far more useful \"Pageless\" mode which is more like a normal webpage that fits to window and scrolls one continuous surface endlessly.\n \nreply",

      "I'm in my late 40s and have been a software engineer in New England since graduating college.  We moved to Massachusetts in 1986, my father went to work at a startup company that was across the street from a DEC building and was in the DEC ecosystem.The pervasiveness of DEC here is amazing even after all these years.  My father in law also spent almost his entire career at DEC and retired as an HP employee.  One of my mentors in my late 20s (older Gen X) started his career there.   I've known many other people who worked at Digital.My only real exposure was being like 10-12 years old and getting trucked to the office during \"crunch time\" and I got to sit at the console on a VAX at one point and got to play early text based games on it.   This was weirdly right in the machine room at the operating console as there was some rework project in the room that my father had to be present for.    Later on at my first internship in the mid 1990s I had a QA job and I had to test software and I remember having to install on both Ultrix and DEC Unix and I got to use some of the Alpha machines.There are still all these buildings and artifacts all over the place from DEC all over MA.   I bank with DCU.   When I was in middle school my best friend and fellow computer nerd's father worked at another Massachusetts institution.. EMC.I never got pushed into software but it seemed to be pre-ordained... we always had computers and I was given free rein to play with them starting in the early-mid-80s but not really allowed to have video games and we always had business type machines and not the more fun consumer oriented stuff.\n \nreply",
      "Beyond DEC, there were many minicomputer and related companies in Massachusetts in their heyday. They weren't all on Route 128 (including DEC) but that was the shorthand.I VERY briefly worked for EMC after they acquired Data General which was a DEC spinoff.\n \nreply",
      "DEC influence was definitely all over the north east! The first multi-user system I dialed into was a VAX/VMS box.

I mean, India has brutal/vicious policies that are out to destroy any and every language that's not English (since it's automatically a threat to central rule from Delhi), but pretty much no intellectual, either in India or the US, actually cares about the mass-wiping out of Indian languages by English...

      "It\u2019s amazing how much boilerplate stuff you don\u2019t have to worry about when you use Phoenix LiveView.  I think I\u2019m in love with it.\n \nreply",
      "I've been writing elixir for years (i think since 0.14?) and have been writing liveview for years. I'm all in on elixir in general, but I'm not sure I'd use liveview for another big project. Maybe it's just rose colored glasses because the TS/React world certainly has its own issues, but I think TS/react and regular old phoenix is a sweet spot. The composability of live view components still has a number of footguns (duplicate IDs, etc) and I think it has higher coupling than a nicely structured react app. You also have to treat liveviews and components fairly differently. All these design choices are for good reason, but it ends up being annoying in a large app. Also in deeply nested trees with lots of component reuse, static typing from TS really helps with refactors. As the projects grew to be large, I think I'm more productive with phoenix/TS than I am with phoenix/liveview.I think there's a certain class of small to medium sized application (I'm building several) where liveview can be a good fit, but after writing it professionally and in hobby projects for several years, I'm less convinced that it's a great solution everywhere.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for taking the time to write this, I feel like I'm always seen the excitement of new users and appreciate some criticism from a veteran.I've been considering LiveView for a real time application I need to make, but haven't been sure whether it's worth the effort of learning Elixir.\n \nreply",
      "For a real time application, there is no better option than elixir and phoenix if you actually want to get something working and shipped. Things that you will need to do which would be wildly complex in other stacks are so simple in erlang and elixir. I highly recommend taking the time to learn it - and it's a fairly simple language so that process should go pretty quickly. The debate about Liveview vs React+Phoenix channels is an exercise left up to the reader.\n \nreply",
      "I have not enjoyed a language and framework like I'm enjoying Elixir and Phoenix! It has become my stack for just about everything.\n \nreply",

The article says this will lead to problems and you'll need PubSub services, but I was hoping LISTEN/NOTIFY would easily scale to hundreds of concurrent users. Please let me know if that won't work ;)Some context: The use case is a digital whiteboard like Miro and the heaviest realtime functionality will be tracking all of the pointers of all the users updating 5x per second. I'm not expecting thousands/millions of users as I'm planning on running each instance of the software on-prem.\n \nreply",

Yes, it's nice because you get it out of the box with Postgres, but you'll find that it's not resilient, you need to be careful with managing DB connections (in your case of hundreds/thousands users it is a significant thing), and it's lackluster compared to a specialized PubSub.\n \nreply"

      "The story with the Indo-Europeans is basically as follows:1. By intersecting ancient word sets of ancient Indo-European languages using comparative phonetics we can try and reconstruct the words of the proto-IE language, both their approximate sounds and approximate meanings. This gives us some information about the society. E.g., the PIE language very likely had a word for wheel, which puts the common PIE community in the period after the wheel was invented. Other words can help us guess what landscape the PIE people lived in, and it has been generally assumed for almost a century now that it strongly resembles Southeastern Europe, essentially the Ukrainian steppe. Two alternative hypotheses (modern-day Turkey and the area to the north, in modern-day Poland/Ukraine) had different drawbacks. We can also look at the locations of the earliest historically attested IE groups (Europe, Middle East, Punjab, Anatolia) and try and guess where they all may have had come from, given the time frame.2. By looking at the descriptions of the earliest IE societies (first of all the society of Rig-Veda), we can try and guess what way of life these people had. We can then look at all the archaeological cultures in the roughly appropriate area from the roughly appropriate time frame and see which of those have features of interest (in the IE case, warrior-like culture with social stratification, etc.).3. We know that IE migrated a lot and provided a lot of genetic material to modern populations in Europe and some other regions. Since quite recently, by looking at palaeo-DNA data from the remains of the people who belonged to these cultures, we can try and check who of them made the biggest contribution to contemporary populations.All these sources of data are rather imprecise, but if you combine them all together and see a clear pattern, this looks rather convincing.\n \nreply",
      "> the society of Rig-VedaI fail to understand how the Rigvedic society can be connected to this DNA research. Rigveda never mentions anything beyond the Punjab/Swat/Haryana region in any of the hymns. The flora and fauna mentioned in it is also exclusive to this region. Lastly there is no mention of an ancient homeland both in Rigveda and Avesta.\n \nreply",

I'm guessing the original question was not that of a game developer but rather a game player, so can you really call this an occupational task?

      "In Germany on a south-facing balcony, producing your own electricity from solar panels is cheaper than the transmission costs of the power company. Meaning that even if the power company somehow had a too-cheap-to-meter fusion power plant, getting that electricity to you is more expensive than you making your own solar power.Part of this is that transmission costs are higher in Germany than e.g. in the US, partially because Germany has a much more robust system with far fewer outages. How to structure these costs will likely become a bigger topic as more people produce their own electricity but still expect the grid to be there when they need it.\n \nreply",
      "Fewer outages vs US source? I work in the power industry in the US and I am sure this is regionally true but highly doubt it as a blanket statement.\n \nreply",

      "Underground powerlines are the norm in Germany, hurricanes, tornadoes or not and their grid would still perform vastly better.\n \nreply",
      "Atlanta, GA has underground power transmission through much of the city (and specifically my neighborhood within the city) and we can still lose power in storms. What isn\u2019t underground currently is being moved there in much of the city. However, the transmission equipment is still outside and still has physical limits. There\u2019s only so much water, so much wind, and so much lightning electrical systems can take without someone going dark. Underground trunks can also flood and short so they\u2019re not a full panacea in areas that have heavy storms.We\u2019ve had a mild storm season the past two years and we\u2019ve maybe been down seconds in total in my area.While the average I\u2019m sure is correct, the distribution is going to depend a lot on what is going on with nature. When I lived in California I lived in an LADWP area so I didn\u2019t experience rolling blackouts. As a kid I had friends that would come over because they lived in an Edison area and play time in air conditioning at my house was much more enjoyable in August. If you were to find the average downtime during that period of time I expect it would saddle everyone with 10-15 minutes of outages even though my area never went down and my friends  lost power for a few hours each week during heat waves.\n \nreply",
      "This is sort of my problem with pushing at-home solar as a primary means to de-carbonize our electricity production. We still need grid access, but with more people not getting their electricity from the grid, the cost to maintain it gets shifted to those who still use it as their primary source of energy. And, well, it's not the poor who are installing kilowatts worth of solar capacity and battery storage on their property.\n \nreply",
      "This is only the case in a few markets that still do 1:1 net metering. I still get charged a grid connection fee (which you\u2019re charged even if you use zero electricity) and when I sell power back to the grid I only am credited the production value and not the full kWh rate. As a result anything I net back I still pay the cost of the transmission infrastructure.\n \nreply",
      "We _need_ grid access, for now. Batteries are getting so crazy cheap. LFP is hitting the market en masse, and right behind that is sodium ion to halve the price again.And, at least where I am, grid _access_ isn't really the biggest cost, capacity is. My power company would love it if I hooked some batteries up to solar and used that during peak hours so they don't have to upgrade every transmission line between me and a bunch of coal in Idaho. In fact, I know this because they pay me to do *exactly that with time-of-use metering.* I don't actually have any solar, but I do have an electric water heater and an electric car, which are both huge batteries, and easy to time shift the charging of.\n \nreply",
