      "but ... why?reply",
      "The mantra for the library is \"raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.\" It's for hobbyist, learners, tinkerers, or just those that want to enjoy minimalistic graphics programming without having to deal with interfacing with modern machines yourself.The default Windows installer bundles the compiler and a text editor to make poking at C to get graphics on the screen (accelerated or not) a 1 step process. Raylib is also extremely cross platform, has bindings in about every language, and has extra (also header only, 0 dependency) optional libraries for many adjacent things like audio or text rendering.When I first started to learn C/C++ in the 2000s I spent more time fighting the IDE/Windows/GCC or getting SDL/SFML to compile than I did actually playing with code - and then it all fell apart when I tried to get it working on both Linux and Windows so I said fuck it and ignored that kind of programming for many years. Raylib is about going the opposite direction - start poking at C code (or whatever binding) and having it break and worry about the environment later when you're ready for something else.reply",
      "As someone who was once a child trying to figure out how to compile and link things to use SDL, I think there's some educational value in letting people make games without having to dive deep into how to use C++ toolchains.reply",

      "An order of magnitude more ;) You need to implement user-programmable shaders, both ARB assembly and GLSL. That needs a GLSL parser, a shader interpreter (talking about compiling it to machine code would add another magnitude of complexity).You also need to implement multitexturing (probably the easy part) but also all the texture combiner stuff too. This one is not hard but also a good chunk of code...All in all, at least 40K if you ask me, but that's a very lowball estimate.Of course if you don't care about implementing the full spec, you can get away with a lot less.reply",

(I know the power injector is supposed to only deliver power when it's safe, but if all your devices work exactly as they should all the time, then I'd like to buy that bridge in Manhattan you're selling).Do you buy Ethernet cables of different colors and say \"Yellow is reserved for PoE, all yellow cables should be assumed to have power on them\"? Or do you slap a \"48V\" label on both ends of the cables you're going to use for PoE and the label is what warns you that this cable should only go into the PoE receiver, and not into an unpowered device? Or do you just not label your PoE cables any differently, and trust that the injector will never malfunction at the same time that you plug the PoE cable into the wrong device?reply",

      "I think every major vendor has had 10G PoE switches: Arista, Aruba/HPE/Juniper, Cisco, Extreme, and Fortinet for sure. The problem is there is little use case for 10G + PoE in the enterprise and even less for consumers. Ubiquity likes to tout it for the 10G APs... but, realistically, most are worried about airtime with APs, not 10G wired throughput from a single one when they have a thousand.As a result, it tends to be relegated to the \"high end switch which has every feature those one-off customers demand but costs an arm and a leg as a result\" model/family. E.g. the only ones I ever sold were to a hospital that wanted to have select switches have 10G for radiology workstations but also wanted to still be able to plug 1G APs in without having to think about the port types. Radiology was covering the cost, so they didn't care it was a waste of money.reply",

[1](They do have their own non spec labeled PoE+++ products though, which are really just \u201c802.3bt Type 4\u201d but they added another plus because that probably sounded better.)

      "Looking at the htop screenshot, I notice the lack of swap. You may want to enable earlyoom, so your whole server doesn't go down when a service goes bananas. The Linux Kernel OOM killer is often a bit too late to trigger.You can also enable zram to compress ram, so you can over-provision like the pros'. A lot of long-running software leaks memory that compresses pretty well.Here is how I do it on my Hetzner bare-metal servers using Ansible: https://gist.github.com/fungiboletus/794a265cc186e79cd5eb2fe... It also works on VMs.reply",
      "Yeah, no way. As soon as you hit swap, _most_ apps are going to have a bad, bad time. This is well known, so much so that all EC2 instances in AWS disable it by default. Sure, they want to sell you more RAM, but it's also just true that swap doesn't work for today's expectations.Maybe back in the 90s, it was okay to wait 2-3 seconds for a button click, but today we just assume the thing is dead and reboot.reply",
      "This is a wrong belief because a) SSDs make swap almost invisible, so you can have that escape ramp if something goes wrong b) SWAP space is not solely an escape ramp which RAM overflows into anymore.In the age of microservices and cattle servers, reboot/reinstall might be cheap, but in the long run it is not. A long running server, albeit being cattle, is always a better solution because esp. with some excess RAM, the server \"warms up\" with all hot data cached and will be a low latency unit in your fleet, given you pay the required attention to your software development and service configuration.Secondly, Kernel swaps out unused pages to SWAP, relieving pressure from RAM. So, SWAP is often used even if you fill 1% of your RAM. This allows for more hot data to be cached, allowing better resource utilization and performance in the long run.So, eff it, we ball is never a good system administration strategy. Even if everything is ephemeral and can be rebooted in three seconds.Sure, some things like Kubernetes forces \"no SWAP, period\" policies because it kills pods when pressure exceeds some value, but for more traditional setups, it's still valuable.reply",

Even if everything is ephemeral and can be rebooted in three seconds.I wouldn't be so quick.  Google ran their servers without swap for ages.  (I don't know if they still do it.)  They decided that taking the slight inefficiency in memory usage, because they have to keep the 'leaked' pages around in actual RAM, is worth it to get predictability in performance.For what it's worth, I add generous swap to all my personal machines, mostly so that the kernel can offload cold / leaked pages and keep more disk content cached in RAM.  (As a secondary reason: I also like to have a generous amount of /tmp space that's backed by swap, if necessary.)With swap files, instead of swap partitions, it's fairly easy to shrink and grow your swap space, depending on what your needs for free space on your disk are.reply",
      "> SSDs make swap almost invisibleIt doesn't. SSDs came a long way but so did memory dies and buses, and with that the way programs work also changed as more and more they are able to fit their stacks and heaps on memory more often than not.I have had a problem with shellcheck that for some reason eats up all my ram when I open I believe .zshrc and trust me, it's not invisible. The system crawls to a halt.reply",
      "It depends on the SSD, I may say.If we're talking about SATA SSDs which top at 600MBps, then yes, an aggressive application can make itself known. However, if you have a modern NVMe, esp. a 4x4 one like Samsung 9x0 series or if you're using a Mac, I bet you'll notice the problem much later, if ever. Remember the SSD trashing problem on M1 Macs? People never noticed that system used SWAP that heavily and trashed the SSD on board.Then, if you're using a server with a couple of SAS or NVMe SSDs, you'll not notice the problem again, esp. if these are backed by RAID (even md counts).reply",

To fix that, audio models rely on combining information from text and audio (having a single model that consumes/produces both text and audio tokens) and the audio tokens basically end up being an integrated speech-to-text/text-to-speech. This reflects my colleagues' experience working on Moshi, and it seems to be the case for other models too, see the Conclusion section.Part of the reason can also be synthetic data: if you fine-tune on data generated from text via a text-to-speech, the tone of the voice doesn't have any information, so the model learns to ignore it.reply",

That\u2019s perfectly fine in many cases (see Unmute), but it\u2019s a wrapper, not real speech understanding. The model can\u2019t hear the frustration in your voice and respond with empathy, it can\u2019t emphasize important words in its answer, it cannot sense sarcasm, and so on.Yes, there are LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode, Qwen, Moshi) that understand and generate speech natively"

      "I would normally say that \"That must be a coincidence\", but I had a client account compromise as well. And it was very strange:Client was a small org, and two very old IAM accounts had suddenly had recent (yesterday) console log ins and password changes.I'm investigating the extent of the compromise, but so far it seems all they did was open a ticket to turn on SES production access and increase the daily email limit to 50k.These were basically dormant IAM users from more than 5 years ago, and it's certainly odd timing that they'd suddenly pop on this particular day.reply",
      "Almost this exact thing happened to me about a year ago. Very old account login, SES access with request to raise the email limit. We were only quickly tipped off because they had to open a ticket to get the limit raised.If you haven't check newly made Roles as well. We quashed the compromised users pretty quickly (including my own, the origin we figured out), but got a little lucky because I just started cruising the Roles and killing anything less than a month old or with admin access.To play devil's advocate a bit. In our case we are pretty sure my key actually did get compromised although we aren't precisely sure how (probably a combination of me being dumb and my org being dumb and some guy putting two and two together). But we did trace the initial users being created to nearly a month prior to the actual SES request. It is entirely possible whomever did your thing had you compromised for a bit, and then once AWS went down they decided that was the perfect time to attack, when you might not notice just-another-AWS-thing happening.reply",

      "For anyone curious about academic studies of historical societal collapses, check out Joseph Tainter [1]> As described in Tainter's Collapse of Complex Societies, societies become more complex as they try to solve problems. [...] Such complexity requires a substantial \"energy\" subsidy (meaning the consumption of resources, or other forms of wealth).> When a society confronts a \"problem,\" such as a shortage of energy, or difficulty in gaining access to it, it tends to create new layers of bureaucracy, infrastructure, or social class to address the challenge. Tainter, who first identifies seventeen examples of rapid collapse of societies, applies his model to three case studies: The Western Roman Empire, the Maya civilization, and the Chaco culture.> For example, as Roman agricultural output slowly declined and population increased, per-capita energy availability dropped. The Romans \"solved\" this problem by conquering their neighbours to appropriate their energy surpluses (as metals, grain, slaves, other materials of value). However, as the Empire grew, the cost of maintaining communications, garrisons, civil government, etc. grew with it. Eventually, this cost grew so great that any new challenges such as invasions and crop failures could not be solved by the acquisition of more territory.  [...]> It is often assumed that the collapse of the western Roman Empire was a catastrophe for everyone involved. Tainter points out that it can be seen as a very rational preference of individuals at the time, many of whom were actually better off. Tainter notes that in the west, local populations in many cases greeted the barbarians as liberators.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainterreply",

      "It all started with ELIZA. Although Weizenbaum, the author of the chatbot, always emphasized that the program was performing a rather simple manipulation of the input, mostly based on pattern matching and rephrasing, popular press completely overhyped the capabilities of the program, with some serious articles debating whether it would be a good substitute for psychiatrists, etc.So, many people, including Searle, wanted to push back on reading too much into what the program was doing. This was a completely justified reaction -- ELIZA simply lacked the complexity which is presumably required to implement anything resembling flexible understanding of conversation.That was the setting. In his original (in)famous article, Searle started with a great question, which went something like: \"What is required for a machine to understand anything?\"Unfortunately, instead of trying to sketch out what might be required for understanding, and what kinds of machines would have such facilities (which of course is very hard even now), he went into dazzling the readers with a \"shocking\" but a rather irrelevant story. This is how stage magicians operate -- they distract a member of the audience with some glaring nonsense, while stuffing their pockets with pigeons and handkerchiefs. That is what Searle did in his article -- \"if a Turing Machine were implemented by a living person, the person would not understand a bit of the program that they were running! Oh my God! So shocking!\" And yet this distracted just about everyone from the original question. Even now philosophers have two hundred different types of answers to Searle's article!Although one could and should have explained that ELIZA could not \"think\" or \"understand\" -- which was Searle's original motivation, this of course does imply any kind of fundamental principle that no machine could ever think or understand -- after all, many people agree that biological brains are extremely complex, but governed by the ordinary physics \"machines\".Searle himself was rather evasive regarding what exactly he wanted to say in this regard -- from what I understand his position has evolved considerably over the years in response to criticism, but he avoided stating this clearly. In later years he was willing to admit that brains were machines, and that such machines could think and understand, but somehow he still believed that man-made computers could never implement a virtual brain.reply",
      "A ridiculous argument. Turing machines don't know anything about the program they are executing. In fact, Turing machines don't \"know\" anything. Turing machines don't know how to fly a plane, translate a language, or play chess. The program does. And Searle puts the man in the room in the place of the Turing machine.reply",
      "So what, in the analogy, would be the program? Surely it's not the printed rules, so I think you're making the \"systems reply\" - that the program that knows Chinese is some sort of metaphysical \"system\" that arises from the man using the rules - which is the first thing Searle tries to rebut.> let the individual internalize all of these elements of the system. He memorizes the rules in the ledger and the data banks of Chinese symbols, and he does all the calculations in his head. The individual then incorporates the entire system. There isn't anything at all to the system that he does not encompass. We can even get rid of the room and suppose he works outdoors. All the same, he understands nothing of the Chinese, and a fortiori neither does the system, because there isn't anything in the system that isn't in him. If he doesn't understand, then there is no way the system could understand because the system is just a part of him.In other words, even if you put the man in place of everything, there's still a gap between mechanically manipulating symbols and actual understanding.reply",

They don't realise that those arguments originated from when computers couldn't even play Go well, leading some people at the time to predict that they would never even get close to understanding language*. Some of those naysayers presented some halfway plausible arguments. Now that computers are way less limited than those skeptics expected, the arguments look dubious.* - And for the sort of idiot who I imagine would bring up Google Translate: Google Translate was never a chat partner, just a translator.

For the kind of high-level GUI applications they are building, having to call cx.handle() to clone a ref-counted value is pure noise. For that matter, for a lot of Rust apps, even cloning a string or a vector is no big deal. On the other hand, for a lot of applications, the answer is definitely yes \u2013 knowing where handles are created can impact performance, memory usage, and even correctness (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give examples later in the post).
