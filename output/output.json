That wizard directed her to a second, who sent her to a third, and she wound up taking a lengthy trek around the city, paying for ferries across the Thames and tromping through livestock yards and sketchy neighborhoods. According to Tabitha Stanmore\u2014who opens her charming book Cunning Folk: Life in the Era of Practical Magic with this account\u2014the whole process would have cost Mabel the equivalent of a skilled tradesman\u2019s pay for a week. And as much as Mabel\u2019s quest sounds like the premise of a fairy tale, Stanmore insists that there was nothing especially unusual about it."
