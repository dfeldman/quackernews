      "I had the privilege of taking Winston's communications/AI seminar class in college.It was an odd format. The class outwardly presented itself as a seminar class where you just read and discuss AI papers. Several of the papers involved doing mean things to ferrets. But really it was a writing/communication class with Winston giving you life advice. I remember one of his teachings was how to build and maintain your network (email them ~twice a year). And also before a big lecture you can warm up your voice by making a barking noise. He also brought donuts to most every class. I miss you professor Winston.reply",
      "What a great seminar, that was. I really appreciated his advice on writing recommendation letters, too: the expectation is shifted wildly towards effusive. If you are plainly complimentary, it can come off as a secret warning that you don't think they are worth hiring.But there were also great AI papers, and meta advice on reading them efficiently. (I don't remember any crimes against ferrets, but presumably the reading list changed over time)I appreciated that class, and it's only grown on me over time. Another line that really stuck with me was something like  \"forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit\" (Which I remembered as \"Perhaps we will look back on even this with fondness\") It's so easy to undervalue amazing things when they are happening to you. I was really convinced that I was appreciating it, even more than many around me. But I still look back and think I could have soaked it in, even more.reply",
      "> He also brought donuts to most every class.In the video he appears to be suffering from metabolic syndrome. He died a few months later. I can testify that is downstream of too many donuts. I'm sure Professor Winston intended it as a kindness, but it's a damaging indulgence as a routine. It looks like he paid a very high price for it. My own workplace suffers from this same \"kindness\".reply",
      "I think the workplace concern is worth trying to improve.  (Certainly, I've been in tech companies that encourage snacks consumption.  Many people end up eating a lot more than they would otherwise, as they sit at their keyboards, with breaks that consist of walking to the snack room/cafeteria and back.)But regarding a particular person, I suppose that friends and family members don't want to be reading random Internet commenters' speculation about that person's health and passing.Maybe bring up the general problem in an HN post, with a link to an informative article?reply",
      "There\u2019s no way you can confidently infer a metabolic syndrome by sight. And a donut once a week isn\u2019t going to induce metabolic syndrome.reply",
      "Incredibly inappropriate. You have 0 clue about anything regarding his medical history. Next time you want to attribute cause of death for someone from an anecdote, do everyone a favor and shut the fuck up.reply",
      "Please explain this to me, as I honestly don't understand it. I didn't claim knowledge, it's just speculation. I speculate about things all day long, why is this different? There really aren't many common conditions that look like Mr. Winston and I do. I'm just supposing horses instead of zebras.Just via the Golden Rule, I would be happy if someone used my own bad example (I have the same condition that I attribute to Prof. Winston) to make the argument personal, if that motivated someone to pick up the apple instead. We lose too many years to high blood pressure, obesity, high glucose, neuropathy, etc., etc., to shut up about the donuts.reply",
      "You're not wrong that he wasn't physically fit, but he was also one of the most human people many of us in this thread have ever met.reply",
      "The late Patrick Henry Winston was well aware of his eating problems and wrote extensively about his very successful effort to reform them. He even stopped eating at his desk in an effort to lose weight. As part of his \"General Patton Diet\", he subsequently lost 60 lbs in 100 days.Before: http://people.csail.mit.edu/phw/pensees/welcomethen.jpgAfter: https://people.csail.mit.edu/phw/pensees/welcomenow.jpg\"I learned to eat and drink veeeeeery slowly at the table meant for eating, not in front of my computer screen. I used to cram in a day's worth of calories in a few minutes, before my body had any idea I was eating anything, which experts say takes 20 minutes.\"https://people.csail.mit.edu/phw/index.htmlHis description of the \"General Patton Diet\" is no longer on his website but may be archived somewhere.Here is a copy that I made when it appeared on his MIT webpages:The General Patton diethttp://people.csail.mit.edu/phw/favorites.htmlFall 2012, first day of class, 255 lbsFall 2013, first day of class, 195 lbsMy doctor said I had three choices: take blood pressure medication, lose weight, or drop dead. My wife said I had turned into a fat blob. After thinking about all that for a couple of years, I decided to lose weight.When I had tried to lose weight before, nothing worked. But I had never tried everything all at once. Many years ago, I watched \u201cPatton,\u201d and I think there was a scene in which he said with pride that he was attacking in all directions at once. So I decided to try what I call the General Patton diet, attacking in all directions at once.First, I quit drinking cream in my coffee. I drink a lot of coffee, and I used to drink it with a lot of cream, so with that, I cut back 400-500 calories per day. Black coffee tasted terrible for a week, but I got used to it, and now the idea of cream in my coffee seems disgusting.Then, I started exercising, almost daily\u2014just fast walking and a little jogging at first, but then, around day 80, just jogging. Another 400-600 calories accounted for in my endorphin-generating exercise.So, exercise and a change in the way I drink coffee constituted a 1000 calorie swing every day.Then, I learned to eat and drink veeeeeery slowly at the table meant for eating, not in front of my computer screen. I used to cram in a day's worth of calories in a few minutes, before my body had any idea I was eating anything, which experts say takes 20 minutes.Then, I substitute fruit for hypoglycemic foods that take blood sugar on a roller coaster ride. I used to get so hungry by 5 pm I could eat my own hand. Now I eat apples instead of junk and the 5 pm problem has gone away.Then, the screwier things. Being interested in why we excel as a species, I note that fire is part of the explanation. Cooked food is partially digested before it goes in our mouth, so we can march more calories into our bodies in less time. That used to be a good thing, but isn't now, so I substitute raw fruits and vegetables for some of the cooked stuff I used to eat.Then, I lift dumbbells while my coffee is brewing, which means I exercise at least five times a day, albeit briefly. It doesn't consume a lot of calories, but it seems to keep my appetite down and maybe keeps my metabolism up.Then, I keep repeating to myself two quotes: \nfrom my friend Jay Keyser: \u201cfood is an addiction;\u201d \nfrom Thomas Jefferson: \u201cno man ever regretted eating too little.\u201d \nPlaying these quotes in my mind, I push away quite a lot of after-I-am-actually-satisfied food.So I attack in all directions at once.Of course what worked for one person doesn't work for another, and you really must talk to your doctor about whether what you are thinking of doing to lose weight is right for you.Anyway, all this happened over the summer, so many of my friends had not seen me for a while, but strangely few asked me if I had lost weight. I finally figured out why when I broached the subject with a friend, Scott Vanderhoof, from whom I buy my hardware, who himself had once lost a lot of weight.\u201cScott,\u201d I said, \u201chaven't you noticed that I have lost weight?\u201d\u201cOn purpose?\u201d\u201cYes, of course,\u201d I said.Then, with a great sigh of relief, he explained that he hadn't said anything because he thought I must have contracted something terrible to lose 60 pounds in 100 days.25 September 2013\nEpilogNow, Registration Day, 2014, has rolled and my weight is the same as a year ago.---reply",

The goal is to capture that premium, holographic effect you see on collectible stickers, trading cards, and high-end packaging, but to render it in real time directly in the browser.If you\u2019ve ever tilted a holographic sticker or watched sunlight catch on a soap bubble, you\u2019ve seen iridescence in action. In the real world, this rainbow shimmer comes from thin-film interference. When light waves bounce between layers of a surface, some wavelengths are reinforced while others cancel out, causing colors to shift depending on your viewing angle.In real-time computer graphics, we don\u2019t need to simulate the exact physics. Instead, we can approximate this by mapping view angle to hue, as the surface tilts relative to the camera, its color smoothly shifts through a spectrum. This gives that dynamic, \u201cali"

Being able to run linux on a simple enough hardware that anybody sufficiently motivated could write an emulator for, help us, as individuals, remain in control.

      "> I mean a standard 64-bit open source motherboard, peripherals, etc that aren\u2019t locked down with binary blobs.The problem here is scale. Having fully-open hardware is neat, but then you end up with something like that Blackbird PowerPC thing which costs thousands of dollars to have the performance of a PC that costs hundreds of dollars. Which means that only purists buy it, which prevents economies of scale and prices out anyone who isn't rich.Whereas what you actually need is for people to be able to run open code on obtainium hardware. This is why Linux won and proprietary Unix lost in servers.That might be achievable at the low end with purpose-built open hardware, because then the hardware is simple and cheap and can reach scale because it's a good buy even for people who don't care if it's open or not.But for the mid-range and high end, what we probably need is a project to pick whichever chip is the most popular and spend the resources to reverse engineer it so we can run open code on the hardware which is already in everybody's hands. Which makes it easier to do it again, because the second time it's not reverse engineering every component of the device, it's noticing that v4 is just v3 with a minor update or the third most popular device shares 80% of its hardware with the most popular device so adding it is only 20% as much work as the first one.

I believe there must be a significant number of people who have played both Minecraft and Super Mario Galaxy, and had something like this sequence of thoughts - although you have followed it all the way to an actual demonstration, and written up your thoughts along the way so clearly.The vertical distortion is the biggest issue IMO, there are a few reasonably satisfying ways to approach the horizontal tiling of each \u201cshell\u201d. For example, you can make your world a donut instead of a sphere, and now you have a perfect grid at each level!

The planet is procedurally generated and fully destructible, allowing players to place or remove more than 20 different block types.While much of the implementation relies on common techniques you\u2019d expect from your average Kirkland brand Minecraft clone, the spherical structure introduces a number of unique design considerations. This post will focus on these more novel challenges.How can I play it?The latest build is available for free on my Itch.io page here. While it\u2019s optimized to run natively for Windows, there is a playable web build available to run in the browser (some jankiness may apply).Why did you make this?I was inspired by an old tech demo by Jordan Peck that I happened to stumble across.

What Herman is doing is a service to us all, and we should find a term (better than 'source-available', which is cold and doesn't capture community projects accurately) that people can promote themselves under without much weeping and gnashing of teeth.EDIT from a comment in a thread way down, that summarises my point:I argue that the natural winner-take-all dynamics of the marketplace are not beneficial to the the mission of free and open source software.

BSD and MIT were used for certain projects, like the BSDs and X11 of course, but the goal back then was to build up a large library of open source (then, \"free software\") as viable alternatives to proprietary software, and the GPL was the easiest way to do that and ensure it remained free.It was the rise of Rails, and the attracting of commercial programmers and startup bros to open source in the '00s, that motivated the historical preference for BSD and MIT licenses.reply",

      "Ballmer's chief mistake was sticking to what worked in the past. He was not willing to let go of the Windows monopoly, and Azure in its early days was based on Windows servers. Then Satya came in and said, no it is OK to support Linux, and in fact it is OK to run Microsoft's own services on Linux. It is OK to support Open Source, and in fact we'll open source some of our stuff. That put Microsoft back on track. For now.Satya's mistake though is that he has filled Microsoft with average people. The best fresh graduates from the top colleges went to Google and Facebook in the last decade -- because they paid significantly more -- and Microsoft picked up the rest. What is the impact of that? Microsoft's execution ability is lower, and we'll see the impact of that in the coming years.Another of Satya's mistakes is his faux pas related to women employees. He was accused -- unfairly in my opinion -- of saying women employees should not ask for a raise. He did no such thing. He said employees should not ask for a raise (not women employees specifically) and instead should rely on the system to give you the appropriate raise at the appropriate time. But since he said that at a women's conference the accusation stood that he meant women employees specifically. Satya has had to fight against this accusation and he has done so by establishing a quota system for promoting women employees. Executive compensation at all levels at Microsoft is directly tied to promotion of women employees, and as a result, a lot of women now occupy positions they would not otherwise. Again, the impact is decreased ability to execute.Microsoft today is the second most valuable company behind Nvidia. But you wouldn't know that looking at their products. They don't have any interesting new products. To some extend they are coasting. Will their success continue into the next decade? It's going to be interesting to watch.reply",
      "Google has largely stagnated with products that they largely already had before Satya Nadella took over. Facebook was kind of at its peak then and they had bought Whatsapp and  added Instagram to their portfolio. But since then, Meta has had a few duds as well and it seems a bit lackluster lately. Messenger launched and imploded. Then VR. And now they are messing up with AI.The point is, if Google and Meta got the best people, what the hell did they do in the last ten years? I think they mostly got more people and less ability to do anything very well. It hasn't worked out that great for them. Neither of them has much to show for their efforts. Google bootstrapped AI and then had their people walk off to form OpenAI who are (for now) best buddies with MS. Facebook/Meta keeps changing their mind about what they are about. Social media, VR, and now AI. But it seems they end up chasing their tail every time.MS actually got better over the last ten years. They too had a few nice acquisitions. But more importantly, they revitalized what was a pretty dead development strategy. Github was critical. The attitude towards Linux and the complete 180 on open source in general was critical. MS did quite a few things right under Nadella.> They don't have any interesting new products.None of these companies do.reply",
      "> what the hell did they do in the last ten years?Having the best people and knowing how to use them effectively are two very, very different thingsreply",
      "I think the point here is that there is nothing to back up the dubious claim that MS recruits were inferior; your observation essentially reinforces that point.reply",
      "I've heard the claim so many times, and pay (that I was good enough to achieve) at MS was lower than salaries for FB and Google posted on Blind, but who knows how real those were. I never bothered to look into it myself. Honestly I was just kind of a Microsoft fanboy at the time, haha.reply",
      "Knowing how google interviews\u2026 I have some doubts that they are in fact hiring the best people.reply",
      "Google search became less effective (imo) but probably more profitable.Google hired the greatest minds to avoid competition that threatened googles monopoly on the search money printerreply",
      "It became so good I had to finally switch to use something else.reply",
      ">The best fresh graduates from the top colleges went to Google and Facebook in the last decade -- because they paid significantly more -- and Microsoft picked up the rest.That seems shaky as a justification. I don\u2019t have any data behind it, but in a world of eight billion people, it\u2019s a hard sell that there\u2019s only enough top talent for 3 companies.Plus, feel free to correct me but I don\u2019t feel Meta has brought anything technically brilliant to the table lately. Google might be a better sell with alphafold and some other projects but none of it seems mainstream tech either.Maybe pixels if you want to stretch it, but search, maps, Gmail, YouTube, android, and even photos were there a decade ago already.reply",
      "Small startups will always excel in talent density because of the increase risk (and reward) and alignment along equity, but all of the large companies have enough technically brilliant people. Many in their 30s or 40s want to do excellent work and also have stability to provide for their families. Whether management gets out of their way is another question.A few projects just in ML: DeepMind has plenty enough for Google alone but Jax and the TPU project are technically ambitious and very strategically important for Google; they hired Adam Paszke away from Meta. Besides Gemini they have Gemma and Veo and they have a reputation in the industry of having extremely high MFU averages. From Facebook there's PyTorch but that's a whole cluster of projects (compiler, abstractions for many accelerators, torchao, torchtitan). They're also famous for DINO and SAM models, as well as many others by FAIR (e.g. Mask R-CNN).reply"

      "I worked for a company making GPU clouds.  The biggest problem we had for deployments was not getting GPUs -- we had plenty of those sitting in warehouses.  The biggest issue was finding data center space with sufficient power and cooling.  There was plenty of square footage, just not enough power for it all.They're now building gigawatt datacenters to handle all the GPUs.The big question is were to build them.  There are only a few places with cheap and plentiful power.  One of those is Quebec (but it's not that big and there is a lot of regulation).  Another is Texas (except their grid isn't very stable).  And the last is China.  And you can't build a datacenter in China unless you're Chinese.It'll be interesting to see how this pans out.

And of course, the HyperCard environment was event-driven; you could write explicitly callable functions, but your entry point was only ever some GUI interaction, not top-level code or a \"main\" function.Perhaps you could say that they both came from a similar philosophy about how to make a programming language \"natural-language-like\".

      "The University of Toronto has a free store and they place items departments discard into 2 areas. 1 area can be grabbed by other departments for a month - then it goes into a public swap shop area for Wednesday AM. Lots of assorted stuff but they place cubic meter boxes of all manner of books, old journals, reference books etc. In the same vein, I have seen dozens of old book stores close over the past 20 years. Truly rare books and incunabulahttps://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/collections/incunabulaI think Ebay was the beginning of the end. Most books in the past ~100 years were printed in substantial press runs, and many had reprints. That meant they were not globally rare, just widely scattered. Ebay revealed their vast numbers and a level marketplace emerged. Books dealers snagged the truly rare and the vast bulk went unwanted and unread. As a Northern claim staker and mine engineer, I often passed by the Highway Bookstore, in Cobalt Ontariohttps://www.highwaybooks.ca/reply",

To withstand the sheer weight of all those hardbacks, the building, which began life as a prep school in c1878, must surely be as strong as a Romanesque church.Certainly the collection has been assembled with an almost religious zeal by sole trader Richard Axe, a spry 70-something who spoke to me from the Philippines, where he lives with his wife roughly half the year.

      "In the microcontroller world, there's already asymmetric RAM like this, although it's all based on the same (SRAM) technology, and the distinction is around the topology. You have TCM directly coupled to the core, then you generally have a few SRAM blocks attached to an AXI cross-bar (so that if software running on different \u00b5c cores don't simultaneously access the same block, you have non-interference on timing; but simultaneous access is allowed at the cost of known timing), and then a few more SRAM blocks attached a couple of AXI bridges away (from the point of view of a core; for example, closer to a DMA engine, or a low power core, or another peripheral that masters the bus). You can choose to ignore this, but for maximum performance and (more importantly) maximum timing determinism, understanding what is in which block is key. And that's without getting into EMIFs and off-chip SRAM and DRAM, or XIP out of various NVM technologies...reply",
      "What they seem to want is fast-read, slow-write memory. \"Primary\napplications include model weights in ML inference, code\npages, hot instruction paths, and relatively static data pages\". \nIs there device physics for cheaper, smaller fast-read slow write memory cells\nfor that?For \"hot instruction paths\", caching is already the answer. Not sure about locality of reference for model weights. Do LLMs blow the cache?reply",
      "> Do LLMs blow the cache?Sometimes very yes?If you've got 1GB of weights, those are coming through the caches on their way to execution unit somehow.Many caches are smart enough to recognize these accesses as a strided, streaming, heavily prefetchable, evictable read, and optimize for that.Many models are now quantized too to reduce the overall the overall memory bandwidth needed for execution, which also helps with caching.reply",
      "Probably not what they want, but NOR flash is generally directly addressable, it's commonly used to replace mask roms.reply",
      "NOR is usually limited to <30MHz, but if you always want to fetch an entire cacheline, and design the read port, you can fetch the entire cacheline at once so that's pretty neat.I don't know if anyone has applied this to neutral networks.reply",
      "> device physics for cheaper, smallerAnd lower power usage. Datacenters and mobile devices will always want that.reply",
      "Yes, this from the paper:> \"The key insight motivating LtRAM is that long data lifetimes and read heavy access patterns allow optimizations that are unsuitable for general purpose memories. Primary applications include model weights in ML inference, code pages, hot instruction paths, and relatively static data pages\u2014workloads that can tolerate higher write costs in exchange for lower read energy and improved cost per bit. This specialization addresses fundamental mismatches in current systems where read intensive data competes for the same resources as frequently modified data.\"Essentially I guess they're calling for more specific hardware for LLM tasks, much like was done with all the networking equipment for dedicated packet processing with specialized SRAM/DRAM/TCAM tiers to keep latency to a minimum.While there's an obvious need for this for traffic flow across the internet, whether or not LLMs are really going to scale like that, or there's a massive AI/LLM bubble about to pop, would be the practical issue, and who knows? The tea leaves are unclear.reply",
      "I'm not seeing the case for adding this to general-purpose CPUs/software. Only a small portion of software is going to be able to be properly annotated to take advantage of this, so it'd be a pointless cost for the rest of users. Normally short-term access can easily become long-term in the tail the process gets preempted by something higher priority or spend a lot of time on an I/O operation. It's also not clear why if you had an efficient solution for the short-term case you wouldn't just add a refresh cycle and use it in place of normal SRAM as generic cache? These make a lot more sense in a dedicated hardware context -- like neural nets -- which I think is the authors' main target here.reply",
      "> Only a small portion of software is going to be able to be properly annotated to take advantage of thisThe same could be said for, say, SIMD/vectorization, which 99% of ordinary application code has no use for, but it quietly provides big performance benefits whenever you resample an image, or use a media codec, or display 3D graphics, or run a small AI model on the CPU, etc. There are lots of performance microfeatures like this that may or may not be worth it to include in a system, but just because they are only useful in certain very specific cases does not mean they should be dismissed out of hand. Sometimes the juice is worth the squeeze (and sometimes not, but you can't know for sure unless you put it out into the world and see if people use it).reply",
      "That's fair, I'm implicitly assuming the area cost for this dedicated memory would be much larger than that of e.g. SIMD vector banks.reply"
