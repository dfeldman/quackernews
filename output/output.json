      "One has to be a little careful with designing courses like this. They are most likely to be of interest to people who already know, at least to some extent, both (i) calculus and (ii) programming. That is, the (presumable) target audience \u2014 those who are learning either of these subjects \u2014 is not really ready to take in such a class.Anecdotally, my personal attempts at incorporating only slightly exotic CASes (Maxima or Sagemath) into calculus courses were met with tepid response at best. Part of the issue was, I believe, that freshmen are rarely interested in setting up software for a non-CS course.That being said, for slightly higher-level classes it can work quite well as an optional component \u2014 I've had really good results with Python projects in an ODE course. Python not being a niche language certainly helped, too.",
      "This is a common challenge in teaching stats where students have to learn statistical concepts and using statistical software simultaneously. In the end, I think it is worth the challenge and beats having students calculate everything by hand & look up values in tables.",
      "Related: if you use Emacs it has the Calc package which supports computer algebra. I recently published an interface for Calc that makes it significantly easier to use and wrote about it here. http://yummymelon.com/devnull/mathing-in-emacs-with-casual.h...",
      "Nice work!Emacs folks may also like the Maxima mode, a very capable interface to a full-blown CAS: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MaximaMode",
      "This comes at a very opportune time in my life. when, my ward enters their HS -Junior year and they are taking SVC. Question to the Author(in case they are monitoring this thread), is it appropriate for a High-schooler with just an intro to Python?",
      "I skipped around in the book a bit and found it interesting. I\u2019d consider encouraging my kids to learn calculus this way.However, I am curious about the first paragraph of the preface:> Julia is an open-source programming language with an easy to learn syntax that is well suited for this task.Why is Julia better suited than any other language?",
      "Julia has a bunch of little niceties for mathematics:* Prefixing a variable with a scaler will implicitly multiply, as in standard math notation (e.g. 3x would evaluate to 6 if x is 2)* Lots of unicode support. Some feel almost gratuitous (\u2208 and \u2209 are operators that work as you would expect) but it's pretty nice to have \u03c0 predefined (it's even an irrational datatype) and to use \u221a as an operator (e.g. \u221a2 is a valid expression and evaluates to a float). It's not just that Julia supports these constructions but provides a convenient way to get them to appear.* This is a little less relevant for calculus but vectors and matrices are fist class types in Julia. Entering and visually parsing matrices is so much easier in Julia than in Python.  m = [1 2 3;\n       4 5 6;\n       7 8 9]\n\nvs.  m = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n\nTransposition is a single character operator ('). Dot product can be done with the dot operator (m \u22c5 n). A\\b works as it does in matlab.* Julia supports broadcasting. It also has comprehensions but with broadcasting I personally find much less need for comprehensions.* Rationals are built-in with very simple syntax (1//2))",
      "I quite like and use Julia but wish there was a language mixing the best aspects of Julia and Swift (which I think can be done without many compromises, i.e. it would be a better language overall).Some things I don't like about Julia:- array.mean().round(digits=2) is more readable than round(mean(array), digits=2)- Poor support for OOP (no, pure FP is not the optimal programming approach).",
      "Well, Julia also has a pipeline operator built in so:  array |> mean |> x->round(x; digits=2)\n\nwill do what you want and is arguably more readable than dot notation.Not supporting OOP is very much intentional. It has structs and multiple dispatch (which has proven to be insanely useful in Julia's domain of scientific computing) so about the only thing you lose is the namespacing that dot syntax facilitates.",
      "You can overload your own types to get a lot of those things (poor support for OOP is harder but you can sort of emulate it with traits). Overloading `getproperty` for the former case.Of course it's not built in, which I understand is annoying if that's your preferred coding style. I personally am sad that really good traits aren't encoded in the language."

      "We did night CTF (~9 pm) at our local grade school campus. Easily 40-50 kids. We just rode our bikes to the gathering. Similar rules to what this article had, except no out of bounds. We had kids making huge circuits around a nearby corn field to evade detection.It was indeed someone of my best childhood memories.Unfortunately it was all brought to an end because people kept calling the cops. They\u2019d see kids after dark at the school and just assume we were up to no good. No property was ever damaged, the principal knew what we were up to, etc. Wholesome fun.After the fifth time of coming home with a \u201cthe cops showed up\u201d story, our well-meaning parents asked us to please find another game to play.",

      "One time in Highschool at a party we played a game of \u201cFugitive\u201d across a few miles of neighborhood. I don\u2019t think anyone crossed any private property, but the police showed up and told us \u201cYou\u2019re scaring the heck out of some people\u201d. We\u2019d basically finished up anyway.It\u2019s tragic that this kind of fun gets quashed. Arguably avoidable with a little community communication. I generally think it\u2019s a product of fear-mongering. People being told that their neighborhoods are under attack from nebulous \u201cothers\u201d who don\u2019t look or sound like them. A ghost story.",
      "It\u2019s super sad how much childhood joy and fun is being sucked out if the world purely due to nosy busybodies. And the fact that police even respond to these (when they won\u2019t even show up if you\u2019re actually robbed) is also ridiculous. Mind your own business, people.",
      "Seeing a lot of similar stories here.  We used to do a game of hide and seek on our massive dead end street.  Wed use peoples bushes and cars to hide.  I still remember the sound of crotchety old mr peabody chambering a round in his shotgun behind us one night.  Pitch black.  Never saw his face, just heard him let us know we were about to die if we didn't leave.  Pretty sure he knew it was 2 little kids",

Lots of fun memories of fugitive when we weren't cooking up fireworks or something from the Anarchist Cookbook.\nMost of we thought was fun would probably be in jail time these days.There was a lot of risky Behavior, but it was all non-violent so if anyone got hurt, it was us, or sometimes our parents property. I don't know how kids these days are supposed to learn you need to cook up white phosphorus Outdoors and not in your friend's kitchen",
      "One time in about 8th grade we had a cap gun fight around a school around dusk. It didn\u2019t end well when a person driving by saw flashes, heard bangs and kids yelling at each other.

We got a firm warning about how that could have ended poorly and to pick other activities to entertain ourselves.",
      "We played tag or hide and seek at a school one time after dark. We were probably 16 or 17 since at least some of us could drive by then. Cops called all of our parents and said we'd go to jail if it happened again.The funniest thing to me was my parents just straight yelling at me about it as my only rule at that time was \"don't get in trouble with the cops\". I tried explaining it was just tag, the cops were over reacting. They didn't buy it. I told them \"I was with Friend A and Friend B. I'm telling you the cops were being ass holes\". They immediately changed their tone to \"oh, if A and B were there, those cops were ass holes\""

      "\"Breakthrough Therapy Designation\" is a regulatory term. It's definitely good news, but it's also a pretty common occurrence that the FDA designates a breakthrough drug, and it does not guarantee that drug's ultimate approval.It's also not really \"news\". It's a development that incrementally smoothes the path for what is still a highly uncertain outcome. And per the linked article it appears to be based on interim data in a phase 1/2 trial. Very early.There are many drugs that look promising at this stage (that's why the breakthrough designation exists!) But this piece of news is unremarkable. Merus, the company behind Petosemtamab, alone has like seven cancer drugs in various stages of development.And there are probably hundreds of cancer drugs in development at any given time.So this is just a mechanical write-up of a regulatory checkpoint for a drug that's like 30% of the way to approval and is among many, many other cancer drugs all sitting at different points along the same continuum.HN is really random sometimes.",
      "I'm struggling to figure out what is being reported. They were mostly able to stop progression in 37% of their test cohort?\"At a data cutoff of February 1, 2023, efficacy-evaluable patients treated with petosemtamab (n = 43) experienced an overall response rate of 37.2%\"They discussed \"progression free\" survival, which seems to mean the condition didn't worsen.",
      "> which seems to mean the condition didn't worsen.That is indeed what it means. The other metric you'll see is Overall Survival, which also is what it sounds like it is.",
      "Yeah that\u2019s all correct. It\u2019s particularly notable because the study was a third line treatment. These patients had already progressed after taking a platinum based chemotherapy, which is a standard first treatment, and they also progressed after taking a PD-L1 immunotherapy. So these patients had very advanced and difficult to treat cancer. This represents a real improvement for them as they probably didn't have many options left outside very invasive surgeries or lots of radiation to the head and neck.Also the treatment targets two cancer genes at the same time. The first is EGFR, which is a very well known therapeutic target. The second is LGR5, and I\u2019m not as familiar with that one, but I think it might be a novel target for cancer. So that's important in that more drugs might target this gene or combinations of LGR5 and others and they might be more effective than this first effort."

Exposure is limited to DoS attacks being planted into the silicon during FPGA fabrication, which yields a significantly improved level of assurance (i.e., the computer may stop working altogether, but can't betray its owner to an adversary while pretending to operate correctly).I suppose in theory the FPGA could contain a hidden CPU that has full read/write access to the FPGA program.Further, if the system becomes popular and more FPGAs need to be produced for the same system or the next generation, then the foundry has additional information and they can make a good guess of where the privilege bit will be. Even simpler, they could program an FPGA with the code and figure it out manually.",
      "This sort of thing is analogous to the \"Thompson hack\" [1], where a malicious compiler has a self-propagating backdoor. It never shows up in the source code, but self-injects into the binaries.Thompson demonstrated this under controlled conditions. But realistically, the backdoor begins to approach AGI-level cunning to evade attempts at detection. It has to keep functioning and propagating as the hardware and software evolve, while still keeping a profile (size, execution time, etc.) low enough to continue evading detection.Work like this that rebuilds modern computing on a completely different foundation, would seriously disrupt and complicate the use of this type of backdoor.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing)#Compiler_...",

      "No, it's the opposite. The FPGA makes it much harder to hide a trojan in the silicon. If the LUTs were biased, it would be detected fairly quickly. A dedicated circuit with an RF interface would be equally obvious in terms of chip usage and power draw.",

      "I have a theory that you are a board game family or you are not.We were not a board game family, apart from the occasional attempt to get through Monopoly without my little sister flinging it onto the floor. My partner, however is from board game people. When we're with her family, there are dice and cards and tokens, words and numbers fly through the air, and I am utterly lost. I played Scrabble with her once. I used to think I was smart.",
      "I come from a (board) game family. I loved games as kid, computer games and board games and physical sports (even though I was bad at most sports, with the exception of running and stealth which is useful for 'levend stratego' [1]). But with my kids I don't enjoy board gaming much yet, as they get angry quickly. I like playing with them, but when it has to go their way solely I feel like 'OK, go solo, you can have control.'I play Wordfeud (a Scrabble clone) with my wife and mother. The three of us are quite competitive with each other. My mother-in-law played a few games, lost each of them, and then called it. Because her idea of having fun is, well, not doing your best. My mother had colleagues whom she played games with (quizzes I think?), and they were terrible simply because she doesn't care. An old book on this is 'Play To Win' by Dave Sirlin.Anyway, legend has it the people who are best at Scrabble are from an SE Asian country (not sure which one it was), often barely speak English, but know all the 2 and 3 letter combinations and are able to lay those down well.[1] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levend_stratego",
      "Tbf, that's a perfectly reasonable reaction from your sister.",
      "Thanks for posting. I've been a user of the Internet Scrabble Club for over 15 years now. I came to it after learning of competitive scrabble from reading Word Freak by Stephan Fatsis [1].I had a background playing internet chess. I started with yahoo and gravitated towards lightning (1/0 time controls). I think there's more than a grain of truth to the quotation, \"I play way too much blitz chess. It rots the brain just as surely as alcohol.\" ~ attributed to Nigel Short, English grandmaster. Fast-paced board games that deliver rewards are addictive.As a student of neurotransmitters, I can attest that playing blitz chess or scrabble does result in dopamine hits. Particular to Scrabble, one can receive such a hit of dopamine from a bingo (50 point bonus for playing all seven tiles). In a three minute (or less) time control, a medium to expert player can look forward to an average of two of these per game. All that's missing from this slot machine is the lights and sounds.Isc.ro is a unique little corner of the internet. It's navigated away from a downloaded console to a browser. It has its fair share of persistent trolls. There's a chat room, channel 20, that used to regularly have over 100 members active at any given time, and significantly more than that during peak hours.Competitive scrabble as a community peaked, IMO, in 2004 with the nationals in New Orleans. There's a Sports Illustrated article chronicling its subsequent problems [2]. NASPA in particular is undemocratic in its governance and pushed a woke agenda during the pandemic, resulting in the removal of hundreds of words from the official lexicons. The net result is there are now at least 4 dictionaries, fracturing an already small and arguably dwindling community of word enthusiasts.An alternative to NASPA in the competitive Scrabble tournament and club scene is WGPO [3]. My personal experience is that most mid-size cities have clubs, and you'll meet worthwhile people in them. I liked to say, at a Scrabble club I always felt comfortable that I was typically not the most nor the least odd fellow there but rather squarely in the middle of the pack.I've noticed a pattern at the Internet Scrabble Club that I also noticed at the Free Internet Chess Server (fics.org), where I migrated after Yahoo games was phased out: a loss of members. ISC now competes with numerous viable alternatives easily accessible from a smartphone. In its heyday, it was unique place where you could navigate the interface with telnet commands. [Insert finger pun here.][1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_Freak\n[2] https://www.si.com/more-sports/2020/10/26/how-scrabble-blew-...\n[3] https://wordgameplayers.org/Edited: for grammar and clarity.",
      "Competitive scrabble certainly isn't helped by the fact that, unlike other relatively mainstream games such as chess, it's jointly owned by Mattel and Hasbro.",
      "yeah, that is without doubt the biggest millstone around scrabble's neck. the community could have done a lot more were it able to freely develop the game and surrounding activities.",
      "> ISC now competes with numerous viable alternatives easily accessible from a smartphone.Is there any technical reason why ISC never became easily accessible from a smartphone? Have there been attempts?",
      "Probably Mattel/Hasbro and trademark/copyright issues.Official mobile games have to be ruined by aggressive monetisation and scammy in-app ads, it seems.Words With Friends got away with a making A Scrabble clone by using a slightly different board layout and dictionary. But they eventually transformed that into a very annoying experience overloaded with the usual F2P clutter.WordFeud seems to be the recommended mobile Scrabble clone these days.",
      "Not that I know of. The wikipedia article on ISC.ro [1] gives the handle (i.e., username) on the owner of the site, \"Carol\". I will say that migration to a browser-based interface has helped. It's now possible to play on a smart phone, albeit a bit awkward, with a small input line for commands.Speaking to an earlier point, the domain of \".ro\" may reflect a reality of who has licensing of Scrabble in Romania, and also outside of the U.S. and U.K. I'm not up to date on all of that.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Scrabble_Club"

      "Yes please! \"Natural\" peanut butter tastes better, but the stirring is IMO not worth it. If the jars were designed better, ie with more empty space at the top above the PB, it would be acceptable. Instead they are designed in such a way that it initially A: Makes you feel like you are bad at it and should try harder and practice, then B: Realize that that this is like those plastic clamshell packaging on some consumer goods: There is no right way to do it; it's a hostile design.",
      "I think if they took your advice, people would complain that they were selling misleadingly empty jars (even if they correctly specified the amount you were getting on the label).",
      "This seems likely. I wonder if explaining it through the packaging, e.g. coloured stripe marked \"stir space\" and an explanation on the back saying don't worry you are only paying per gram of peanut butter...",
      "Except that the larger packaging size is not totally free - makes shipping more expensive and less units per shelf space. Not sure by how much. I bet peanut butter margins aren\u2019t great.",
      "The top part of a plastic jar could be expandable/collapsible maybe. Thinking of something similar to the bendy bit in a plastic straw.",
      "I've seen some powdered dish detergent boxes do this.",
      "I stir once when I get home from the grocery store then place it in my fridge upside down.The peanut oil congeals and then you have perfectly mixed smooth pb on demand.",
      "For years we stored Adams natural peanut butter at room temperature with no ill effects. A large jar usually lasts less than a month. Then one day I noticed it says refrigerate after opening on the label. I wonder if that is the reason why, or if it's really prone to spoilage.",
      "It will spoil/go rancid. Even the 'non-natural' big brands like Jif/Skippy taste and smell 'off' if they sit out for a few weeks after being opened.There's no winning here, because putting it in the fridge makes it hard to spread. The best approach is to take out a week's worth or so and put it in a small/airtight container. Leave that out but put the main jar in the fridge.",
      "I've been buying 100% peanut butter for years, never stored it in a fridge and never had it go bad. Maybe your room temperature is higher? It's strange as with a single ingredient product I would expect we would have the same results...The separation and mixing is a pain though. Love the mixer idea!"

Similar issues (though through lower tech hacking) happened in 7th of October during the Hamas attack in Israel, where the over-reliance on advanced, complicated technology became a liability.The stuff you describe make sense in normal, peaceful situations, where the cost of securing certain infrastructure can be higher than the cost of a power cut once.

Replace AGI with \"no BYOD policy\" and I bet there's a startup somewhere where it turned out that safety guy was super intent on the policy, senior leadership wasn't, and eventually safety guy quits.Or it could all be as serious and dire as it seems.

While you can force GPT to do the same, it may not be as \"natural\" e.g. high chance of GPT3.5 not doing it.2. XML tags vs full XMLUsing XML tags doesn't mean it would be amazing at outputting full valid XML. XML tags are great because there's no further formatting needed within. If you only want to separate sections in your prompt or response, XML tags are perfect for clearly marking start and end, as well as featuring syntax (<>) that's rarely seen in natural text.If it comes to generating a full data schema valid object, my experience is that JSON works way  better than XML. It just seems to be a good middle ground between structure while having little overhead. I remember a recent AirBnB posts saying that YAML works even better than JSON.

Markdown is okay as input, but testing shows better accuracy if input components are wrapped in XML tags. While it would be ideal for extracting data, JSON syntax is too sensitive as output. Often an offending character will be unescaped no matter how good your prompt is.If you stay within the very basic syntax of XML (just tags) it is also the best output. I suspect it is to do with the descriptive nature of the tag structure. Something wrapped in the tag <summary> will hint to the model that it should produce a summary, reinforcing the input prompt as the output is being constructed.",

      "Cute!",
      "Is it me, or was there an attempt to inject words that rhyme with hoot in every sentence?But more to the point, I absolutely love how well Hoot works, I've been playing with it for the last month and plan on doing the next Lisp game jam with it.",
      "An astute observation that would be hard to dispute.",
      "Reading this was definitely a hoot.",
      "Well ain't that just cute.",
      "Side note but it is sad as hell that arguments.callee is gone (in esm, a long with arguments in general), which was such an excellent way for functions to take whatever bindings it has & turn them into accessors. I miss like hell the JS world where functions could easily show off some internals.    function add(a) {\n        return a + arguments.callee.amount\n    }\n    add.amount = 2\n    console.log(add(2)) // => 4\n\n(In this simple eread-only example arguments.callee could be be replaced with add, but if one is doing inline function definitions or other cases that's not possible.)And that was something devs explicitly had to do in their libraries! But in guile there's some automatic capability to expose your bindings.> Guile programs can use first-class accessors on the module systems to pull out bindings.In general, I strongly feel like the ability for the language to let developers explore the bindings is like \"the\" missing piece of programming language systems, is one of the primary gates to good metaprogramming ever emerging. I wish the runtime would be observable.",
      "You can still emulate this to an extent with a wrapper function:  function selfBind(f) {\n      return function g(...args) {\n          return f.call(this, g, ...args);\n      };\n  }\n  \n  let add = selfBind(function (callee, a) {\n      return a + callee.amount;\n  });\n  add.amount = 2;\n  /* ... */\n\nThough obviously it isn't quite as straightforward as 'arguments.callee'.",
      "Hoot looks awesome, but I've yet to get past the initial hurdle of screwing around with guix. Frankly, I need another package manager like I need a hole in the head.It really needs someone to give other package managers some love (Homebrew, apt, rpm...)"

      "Just an hour ago, I learned about Przybylski's Star. [0]> Przybylski's observations indicated unusually low amounts of iron and nickel in the star's spectrum, but higher amounts of unusual elements such as strontium, holmium, niobium, scandium, yttrium, caesium, neodymium, praseodymium, thorium, ytterbium, and uranium.While the explanation is likely some unknown natural process, salting a star with an impossible chemical composition might also be a way for a technological species to create a monument, correct? This seems like it would involve moving less mass around than a Dyson Sphere/Swarm, although it would need a constant feed, if I understand the situation correctly.Astonishingly, there appears to be no contemporary analysis of this star.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przybylski%27s_Star\"The Star That Shouldn't Exist\" - Prof. David Kippinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maMDGZOD3mI\"Why is There Plutonium in This Star? Przybylski\u2019s Star with David Kipping\" - Event Horizonhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUbjdaPy4mw",
      "I feel like it is the duty of every intelligent species in the universe to create such monuments. Because we all have the same question. Are we alone?",
      "It's just the opposite, actually. Game theory reveals that the best thing an intelligent species can do is to hide. (The dark forest hypothesis)",
      "I imagine it depends on whether interstellar travel is practical. If intelligent species come to the conclusion that they\u2019re forever isolated, a monument seems a rational, almost inevitable choice.",
      "And how do you know you're forever isolated? There are things you don't know that you don't know. No rational species would ever build a monument IMO, and again, game theory supports this so far.",
      "How can game theory tell us that hiding from a malicious civilization is a safer choice than exposing ourselves to a benevolent civilization that could rescue us from some danger impossible for us to handle?",
      "If you reduce down your idea to an animals in the woods you will quickly see why.Humans become a rabbit, the malicious species a fox, the benevolent species humans.If the rabbit is injured, making noise and hoping for humans to help is a fools errand as the fox is more likely to hear and eat the rabbit.This is engrained in our evolution.",
      "My opinion is based on different theories and hypotheses, but the prevalent opinion is that there can't be a benevolent civilization in the first place. And even if there are, they would continue hiding themselves.Essentially, any alien civilization that survives in the long term is silent and hostile. But especially silent since being hostile can reveal your location.",
      "> but the prevalent opinion is that there can't be a benevolent civilization in the first place.You'd have to explain why. Logically, the first two civilizations to \"team up\" would easily handle any single civilization that challenges them. A civilization that happens to beat them would find among its attractive options a Nobunaga Gambit: taking on the vanquished foe's mission of unification (since it worked until it didn't - and the one time it didn't work, there was a terrifyingly good chance that it could have).\"The Dark Forest\" as an idea is inextricable from its cultural origins, a China that's rather pessimistic about inter-civilizational contact because of its recent history. That it resonates amidst a zeitgeist of global instability doesn't make it universally correct. Gene Roddenberry's competing vision might seem optimistic, but it's not naive; beneath Starfleet's cheery veneer is the Neo Princess Serenitian realpolitik of, \"Peace, or else.\"",
