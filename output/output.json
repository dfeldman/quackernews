There's then problem of getting the money there without anyone noticing, then there's the problem of what kind of characters you're going to be defrauding overseas.All told - probably a better idea is to use all that cleverness to make a 1.5 million dollars the good old fashioned way:  Spending a few years saying, \"Nothing from my end\" on Zoom calls.reply",

      "They don't link to the Form S-1 prospectus from their announcement, but it's publicly available at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025...Their highlighted metrics page: $821M LTM revenue, 46% YoY revenue growth, 18% non-GAAP operating margin, 91% gross margin.It's an incredible success story, and the engineering they did upfront (primarily led by co-founder Evan Wallace) that set the stage for their success is the stuff of legends. https://madebyevan.com/figma/ has links to numerous blog posts breaking it down, but here are some choice quotes:> [Evan] developed the hybrid C++/JavaScript architecture for Figma's editor that made it possible to build a best-in-class design tool in the browser. The document representation and canvas area is in C++ while the UI around the canvas is in JavaScript (the team eventually settled on TypeScript + React for this). This let us heavily optimize the document representation to reduce memory usage and improve editing speed while still using modern UI technologies for fast iteration on our UI. C++ development was done using Xcode (not in the browser) to provide a better debugging environment.> Even though the contents of Figma documents are similar to what HTML can display, Figma actually does all of its own document rendering for cross-browser consistency and performance. Figma uses WebGL for rendering which bypasses most of the browser's HTML rendering pipeline and lets the app work closely with the graphics card. The rendering engine handles curve rendering, images, blurs, masking, blending, and opacity groups, and optimizes for high visual fidelity.> [Evan] developed Figma's multiplayer syncing protocol, worked on the initial version of the multiplayer live collaboration service (a kind of specialized real-time database), and added multiplayer syncing support to Figma's existing editing application. The initial version was written in TypeScript but [he] later ported it to Rust for improved performance and stability.It's a great reminder that it's not premature optimization if your UI's fluidity is your distinctive feature and your calling card! And the business acumen to turn this into such a wildly successful product in the context of competitors with kitchen-sink feature lists can't be understated, either. I have an incredible amount of respect for this team, and they should inspire all of us to tackle ambitious projects.reply",
      "I was one of their first Enterprise customers way back in 2017\u2019ish-give-or-take.The brilliance of the system he built was that it allowed for real time collaboration.  Which was  god send from the Sketch -> Zeplin -> Invision -> Avocode (version management) \u2018stack\u2019 that lost Enterprise design orgs were using.Which was already a large leap from what Adobe was expecting us to do with Photoshop/Illustrator (after they depreciated Fireworks).Figma made handoff much easier. Made version control dead simple.  Made my life as a UX leader much much better.  I remembered talking to a few now-Gigantic companies back then and we all plotted the move togetherIt wasn\u2019t lost on us that Sketch is/was much much smoother with its usage of Mac OS\u2019s native shape rendering.  It\u2019s just that the benefits far outweighed the small drop in snappiness.And for anyone who\u2019s going to say \u201cSketch was Mac only that\u2019s why it failed!\u201d  I assure you that had nothing to do with it.  For the same reasons an entire generation of UX/UI designers stopped using Axure.   But we would need to start talking about Invision 7 and Invision Studio if you wanted to get into the nitty gritty.reply",

      "As a former figma engineer, let me be the first to say that Evan Wallace is, in fact, a legend. A true 100x-er. There's still parts of the codebase basically no one at Figma really understands that Evan wrote back in the day.One example of that is something like he adapted a shader we use internally to render font glyphs, which no one has touched ever since. The engineer who told me this had spent a few days trying to understand it and said (after having worked in this area for years) was stumped by it.reply",
      "Font rendering is indeed complex, but the anecdote seems to be misleading readers into thinking Evan wrote obscure code.I worked extensively in the parts of the Figma where Evan wrote a lot of foundational code, and have also worked directly with him on building the plugin API.One of Evan's strong points as a CTO is that he was very pragmatic and that was reflected in his code. Things that could be simple were simple, things that needed complexity did not shy away from it.While all codebases have early decisions that later get changed, I'd say that largely speaking, Figma's editor codebase was built upon foundations that stood the test of time. This includes choices such as the APIs used to build product code, interact with multiplayer, the balance between using OOP v.s. more functional or JS-like patterns, the balance between writing code in C++/WASM v.s. JS, etc. Many of these choices can be credited to Evan directly or his influence.Subsequent engineers that joined were able to build upon the product without causing a spiraling mess of complexity thanks to those good decisions made early on. In my opinion, this is why Figma was able to ship complex new features without being bogged down by exploding tech debt, and a major contributing factor to the business's success as a whole.reply",
      "I don\u2019t know anything about shaders and this is not personal against Evan, but if someone wrotes code that nobody understands, isn\u2019t it bad thing and not good thing? I thought similarly (admired) many years ago, that those people are wizards and that is cool, but the older I get, less I think so. You often can write the same thing so that it is also easier for others to understand. In most cases, when we talk about compiled languages, compiler optimises it anyway, if you use some extra variables and so on.reply",
      "Exactly, I had the same issue when I was younger. I thought if I read code I could not understand was because the other dev was a legend. Now its the opposite, I am amazed by code that does its job well, its understandable and has low complexity.reply",
      "I don\u2019t mean this to throw shade, but isn\u2019t the whole point of writing code that someone else can understand it? I worked with some crazy smart people when I was in academia, and when one of them left it was not worth trying to maintain what they left behind because it was so often inscrutable.reply",
      "Font rendering code is a nightmare because the problem is really damn hard. Font files are complex, and actual real world usage is even worse.Any code that involves parsing old school binary file formats is going to look ugly to modern day developers who are used to JSON everything, even if the code is actually very well structured.reply",
      "Even well-written code can be hard to understand -- practically impossible, even -- if what it's doing is sufficiently complex. Cryptography and certain areas of graphics have humbled me, for instance. I followed the flow, and I appreciated the comments, but I did not understand.reply"

      "Genuine question for people in the field. My understanding is that the cooling effect of trees is primarily driven by evaporative cooling. That is, the shade effect only really exists because the plant does not shrivel up and die due to storing water. How much more effective are trees vs. big swamp coolers? Even in this article, they admit that daytime cooling of half a degree requires 3 times more water.reply",
      "There is something to be said for the parts about shading the surface too though. You're unlikely to cool an entire desert a significant amount with water you bring in but if that's something that happens as part of keeping the actual surfaces in the city cooler during peak heat times on top of the air cooling effects of evaporation then the sum result is greater than the parts in terms of effect.Of course it's Vegas, I wouldn't be surprised if we decided to make the downtown completely indoors so we could just run AC in the streets too. It's not exactly the city of practicality.reply",
      "They do outdoor AC in [some places in some] parks in Qatar.reply",
      "Under the sand on the beach, too!reply",
      "Sounds like Qatar. Innovative and expensive.reply",
      "In the abstract it discusses that most of the effect (16deg Celsius) is from reduced radiative heating and only a few degrees from evaporation.Mostly the benefit is instead of having the concrete under you absorb and emit the sun, the leaves above you do.This dramatically reduces the heat we feel at human height.reply",
      "> the effect (16deg Celsius)Did I read that right?  16\u00b0C seems like an enormous effect.Seems like trees would be a small investment to effectively get \"outdoor AC-ish\"?reply",
      "Even without any evaporative effect, the air cooling of leaves (at least bringing them to the surrounding air temperature) happens more easily than that of concrete pavement due to height and larger surface area. The concrete can easily get heated much hotter than the air at even 10-20ft.Wrt. water consumption - Mediterranean species like say olive trees are kind of optimized for low water consumption, by for example having leaves covered with wax-like stuff decreasing evaporation.reply",
      "Trees are also vertical structures.  Any vertical structure will absorb some of the light, turning it into heat, then be cooled by rising air.  This keeps the heat from getting to the ground, with or without evaporation.  In other words, instead of the sidewalk getting hot, something 20+ feet in the air get hot. Hot air rises and the air near the ground stays cooler.reply",
      "The point of that article is that in many places the evaporative cooling is the main thing but in Vegas the water situation is such that it's more about the shade so the optimal tree is something that gives shade but doesn't need a lot of water.Right where I am sitting now I have an LED strip above my desk and when I have my shirt off (right now) I can very definitely feel the radiant energy when it is on,  so if it is really hot I either turn it off or switch it to green because the eye is most sensitive to green light.  In fact,  as I'm writing this,  I just set the backlight on the 55-inch TV I use as a computer monitor down so I'd feel more comfortable.reply"

      "> Sedna is expected to pass through the perihelion of its orbit in 2075--2076 and then move again away from the Sun. Considering the distances involved, a mission targeting the object would need to be launched \"relatively\" soon, especially if using conventional propulsion systems, which could require up to 30 years of deep-space travel.Sedna's perihelion is ~76 AU - more than twice as far as Pluto, which took New Horizons nearly a decade to reach.Sedna's apehelion is over 500 AU.> The Direct Fusion Drive rocket engine is under development at Princeton\nUniversity Plasma Physics LaboratoryIs it ... is it actually working? How close are they? And even if they get it to work next year, will it be something well-engineered & reliable enough to send it into space for 10 years and expect it to work?reply",
      "There's also Pulsar Fusion, a UK company currently building a Dual Direct Fusion Drive (DDFD). They claim:> Modelling shows that this technology can potentially propel a spacecraft with a mass of about 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) to Pluto in 4 years.They're apparently targeting an in-orbit test in 2027. Even if this were to slip to 2030, and becomes commercially available in 2040, I expect that would be plenty of time for a rendezvous with Sedna's perihelionreply",
      "When it comes to the UK space industry all I can think of is Skylon and Reaction Engines Ltd. Or more how they spent 20 years working on an engine that never left the ground until going bankrupt.Hopefully this time round it goes a bit better than that.reply",
      "Yeah, the British space industry has struggled; principally with investment. Reaction Engines largely went under because they ran out of money and their investors declined to put more money in.My hope with Pulsar Fusion is that their existing thruster business provides the necessary revenue to both keep them solvent, and attract continued investment, until they're able to get their Fusion Drive off the ground.reply",
      "I remember when Reaction turned down relocating to America in favour of some minor support from London. It was around 2014 and we all figured it was D. O. A.reply",
      "Frankly it seemed like an idea that made no sense for multiple reasons.  For one thing the density of atmospheric oxygen is a fraction of the density of liquid oxygen so it's hard to picture getting enough oxygen in the thing to make a difference.  If you're liquifying it you're going to slow your rocket down by bringing O2 as well as 4 times as much N2 on board,  then there is the weight of the liquification plant.  Investing in Skylon is like investing in cold fusion.It was bad enough that Richard Branson discredited private orbital spaceflight with the overly long development process for a vehicle that made the Space Shuttle look like a paragon of safety and low costs -- Skylon was so much worse.reply",
      "Henry Spencer on air breathing launchers (New Scientist, 2009):https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/03...'Trying to build a spaceship by making aeroplane fly faster and higher is like trying to build an aeroplane by making locomotives faster and lighter - with a lot of effort, perhaps you could get something that more or less works, but it really isn't the right way to proceed. The problems are fundamentally different, and so are the best solutions.As Mitch Burnside Clapp, former US Air Force test pilot and designer of innovative launcher concepts, once commented: \"Air breathing is a privilege that should be reserved for the crew\".'reply",
      "https://web.archive.org/web/20090727013542/http://www.newsci...(The original link says \"Page is Gone\")And here's some more quotingCould a single-stage-to-orbit spaceship, something that could operate rather like an aeroplane, be built with just rocket engines? Well, actually, yes. In the 1980s, NASA and the US Air Force spent about $2 billion trying to build the X-30, a single-stage spaceship powered by scramjets (with help from rockets, of course). It never flew. At the same time, for comparison, NASA's Langley Research Center studied building a single-stage pure-rocket spaceship. The results were interesting.The pure-rocket design was more than twice as heavy as X-30 at takeoff, because of all that LOX. On the other hand, its empty weight - the part you have to build and maintain - was 40% less than X-30's. It was about half the size. Its fuel and oxidiser together cost less than half as much per flight as X-30's fuel. And finally, because it quickly climbed out of the atmosphere and did its accelerating in vacuum, it had to endure rather lower stresses and less than 1% of X-30's friction heating. Which approach would be easier and cheaper to operate was pretty obvious.The Langley group's conclusion: if you want a spaceship that operates like an aeroplane, power it with rockets and only rockets.reply",
      "See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_X-33There have been some other discussions of this lately,  but I would say the pursuit of SSTO resulted in a lost decade for spaceflight in the 1990s.SSTO is just barely possible,  the problem is that you have a big rocket that carries a tiny payload so you are driven to exotic engines, exotic materials, and various risky technologies.If Musk had any good idea it was not only falling back to two-stage-to-orbit reusable rockets but also recognizing that it was worth just reusing the first stage.  A SSTO gets closer to aircraft-like operations in that you don't need to stack two stages on top of each other,  but given how much TSTO improves everything else it's probably worth just optimizing the stacking.reply",
      "And I strongly suspect Henry knew the \"don't turn an airplane into a launcher\" extended to using wings for landing and takeoff as well, although in 2009 that maybe wasn't quite as inescapable a conclusion as it is today.reply"

      "This is actually very cool. Not really replacing a browser, but it could enable an alternative way of browsing the web with a combination of deterministic search and prompts. It would probably work even better as a command line tool.A natural next step could be doing things with multiple \"tabs\" at once, e.g: tab 1 contains news outlet A's coverage of a story, tab 2 has outlet B's coverage, tab 3 has Wikipedia; summarize and provide references. I guess the problem at that point is whether the underlying model can support this type of workflow, which doesn't really seem to be the case even with SOTA models.reply",
      "> tab 1 contains news outlet A's coverage of a story, tab 2 has outlet B's coverage, tab 3 has Wikipedia; summarize and provide references.I think this is basically what https://ground.news/ does.(I'm not affiliated with them; just saw them in the sponsorship section of a Kurzgesagt video the other day and figured they're doing the thing you described +/- UI differences.)reply",
      "I am a ground news subscriber (joined with a Kurzgesagt ref link) and it does work that way (minus the wikipedia summary). It's pretty good and I particularly like their \"blindspot\" section showing news that is generally missing from a specific partisan new bubble.reply",
      "Thank you.I was thinking of showing multiple tabs/views at the same time, but only from the same source.Maybe we could have one tab with the original content optimised for cli viewing, and another tab just doing fact checking (can ground it with google search or brave). Would be a fun experiment.reply",
      "> I was thinking of showing multiple tabs/views at the same time, but only from the same source.I think the primary reason I use multiple tabs but _especially_ multiple splits is to show content from various sources. Obviously this is different that a terminal context, as I usually have figma or api docs in one split and the dev server on the other.Still, being able to have textual content from multiple sources visible or quickly accessible would probably be helpful for a number of usersreply",
      "Interestingly, the original idea of what we call a \"browser\" nowadays \u2013 the \"user agent\" \u2013 was built on the premise that each user has specific needs and preferences. The user agent was designed to act on their behalf, negotiating data transfers and resolving conflicts between content author and user (content consumer) preferences according to \"strengths\" and various reconciliation mechanisms.(The fact that browsers nowadays are usually expected to represent something \"pixel-perfect\" to everyone with similar devices is utterly against the original intention.)Yet the original idea was (due to the state of technical possibilities) primarily about design and interactivity. The fact that we now have tools to extend this concept to core language and content processing is\u2026 huge.It seems we're approaching the moment when our individual personal agent, when asked about a new page, will tell us:    Well, there's nothing new of interest for you, frankly:\n    All information presented there was present on pages visited recently.\n    -- or --\n    You've already learned everything mentioned there. (*)\n    Here's a brief summary: \u2026\n    (Do you want to dig deeper, see the content verbatim, or anything else?)\n\nBecause its \"browsing history\" will also contain a notion of what we \"know\" from chats or what we had previously marked as \"known\".reply",
      "It would have to have a pretty good model of my brain to help me make these decisions. Just as a random example, it will have to understand that an equation is a sort of thing that I\u2019m likely to look up even if I understand the meaning of it, just to double check and get the particulars right. That\u2019s an obvious example, I think there must be other examples that are less obvious.Or that I\u2019m looking up a data point that I already actually know, just because I want to provide a citation.But, it could be interesting.reply",
      "Well we should first establish some sort of contract how to convey the \"I feel that I actually understand this particular piece of information, so when confronted with it in the future, you can mark is as such\".  My lines of thought were more about a tutorial page that would present the same techniques as course you have finished a week prior, or news page reporting on an event you just read about on a different news site a minute before \u2026 stuff like this \u2026 so you wold potentially save the time skimming/reading/understanding only to realise there was no added value for you in that particular moment. Or while scrolling through a comment section, hide comment parts repeating the same remark, or joke.Or (and this is actually doable absolutely without any \"AI\" at all):    What the bloody hell actually newly appeared on this particular URL since my last visit?\n\n(There is one page nearby that would be quite unusable for me, had I not a crude userscript aid for this particular purpose.  But I can imagine having a digest about \"What's new here?\" / \"Noteworthy responses?\" would be way better.)For the \"I need to cite this source\", naturally, you would want the \"verbatim\" view without any amendments anyway.  Also probably before sharing / directing someone to the resource, looking at the \"true form\" would be still pretty necessary.reply",

I don't want any phone calls, ever. I'll get to your messages when my flow state has subsided.You're not alone. Here's how I solved it: Last year I really wanted a new smartphone just for the better camera. My existing phone from 2018 was still working fine, but the camera sucked.So I bought a used, but only few months old, new smartphone.And I never got it hooked up to the cell network (i.e. no SIM card). I now typically carry two phones on me. The old one is for texts/phones. The new one is for everything else. A clean separation. At times when I do groceries or something, I leave the SIM phone in the car so no one can contact me.When the old phone finally dies, I'll just find the cheapest smartphone to replace it and maintain the separation.For app notifications, I use the Buzzkill app to keep them down. For a long time I had it set up such that I would not get any notification for texts - other than a vibration. No sound. No flashing LED. And no notification in the task bar. If I wanted to know if I'd received a text, I'd have to open the app. I strongly encourage this set up.Before I got a smartphone, I would turn my cell phone on only for emergencies and the occasional coordination (picking someone up - call him and let him know I'm downstairs). I told people they wouldn't be able to reach me on my cell phone, and to call my home phone (landline, and then VoIP) if they needed me.Then I finally got a smartphone. I still have that home phone. But boy, I often tell people that my life is definitely worse because of that smartphone. I like the portable computing device, camera and GPS. Just not the phone part!reply",

I can use the SIMless phone around the house and not worry about pings.reply",

      "Definitely of a similar mindset... my text notification chime is about as subdued as I can make it... I mean I don't want to miss a text entirely, but would really rather push it all off.  I disabled email notifications and other app notifications entirely.  I wouldn't disable my actual phone calls, though I don't like that nearly half the calls I get are either spam, or bots notifying my of dr appts.It's all gotten so dysfunctional as a whole.  My SO gets on Tiktok live chats (whatever they're called) and I'll get into an X space now and then.  Once in a great while, I'll pull up IRC.  I really do miss the days of AIM an Yahoo Messenger chat groups though.  It was fun.  I also miss the locality of BBSing back when.

      "Thanks to author for doing some solid work in providing data points for modules. For those like me looking for the headline metric, here it is in the conclusion  While the evidence shown above is pretty clear that building a software package as a module provides the claimed benefits in terms of compile time (a reduction by around 10%, see Section 5.1.1) and perhaps better code structure (Section 5.1.4), the data shown in Section 5.1.2 also make clear that the effect on compile time of downstream projects is at best unclear. \n\nSo, alas, underwhelming in this iteration and perhaps speaks to 'module-fication' of existing source code (deal.II, dates from the '90s I believe), rather than doing it from scratch. More work might be needed in structuring the source code into modules as I have known good speedup with just pch, forward decls etc. (more than 10%). Good data point and rich analysis, nevertheless.reply",
      "It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they could do better if they gave up on doing most of the work programmatically.One part of me agrees with (both from the paper)> For example, putting a specific piece of code into the right place in each file (or adding necessary header files, as mentioned in Section 5.2) might take 20-30 seconds per file \u2013 but doing this for all 1051 files of deal.II then will take approximately a full day of (extremely boring) work. Similarly, individually annotating every class or function we want to export from a module is not feasible for a project of this size, even if from a conceptual perspective it would perhaps be the right thing to do.and> Given the size and scope of the library, it is clear that a whole-sale rewrite \u2013 or even just substantial modifications to each of its 652 header and 399 implementation files \u2013 is not feasiblebut another part knows that spending a few days doing such \u2018boring\u2019 copy-paste work like that often has unexpected benefits; you get to know the code better and may discover better ways to organize the code.Maybe, this project is too large for it, as checking that you didn\u2019t mess up things by building the code and running the test suite simply takes too long, but even if it seems to be, isn\u2019t that a good reason to try and get compile times down, so that working on the project becomes more enjoyable?reply",
      "This is a great task for LLMs, honestly.reply",
      "A few points1) modules only really help address time spent parsing stuff, not time spent doing codegen. Actually they can negatively impact codegen performance because they can make more definitions available for inlining/global opts, even in non-lto builds. For this reason it's likely best to compare using thin-lto in both cases.2) when your dependencies aren't yet modularized you tend to get pretty big global module fragments, inflating both the size of your BMIs and the parsing time. Header units are supposed to partially address this but right now they are not supported in any build systems properly (except perhaps msbuild?). Also clang is pretty bad at pruning the global module fragment of unused data, which makes this worse again.reply",
      "Oh, it\u2019s Wolfgang. In computational math, he has a focus on research software that few others are able to do, he (the deal.ii team more generally) got an award for it last SIAMCSE. Generally a great writer, looking forward to reading this.reply",

      "As per Office team, modules are much faster, especially if you also make use of C++ standard library as module, available since C++23.See VC++ devblogs and CppCon/C++Now talks from the team.Pre-compiled headers have only worked well on Windows, and OS/2 back in the day.For whatever reason UNIX compilers never had a great implementation of it.With exception of clang header maps, which is anyway one of the first approaches to C++ modules.reply",
      "This has been puzzling me for over 3 decades. My first experience with C++ was Borland C++ for DOS. It had precompiled headers and it worked extremely well.Then around 1995 I got access to HP-UX and native compiler there and GCC. Nobody heard about precompiled headers and people thought the only way to speed up compilation was to get access to computer with more CPUs and rely on make -j.And then there was no interest to implement precompiled headers from free and proprietary vendors.The only innovation was unity builds when one includes multiple C++ sources into super-source. But then Google killed support for it in Chromium claiming that with their build farm unity builds made things slower and supporting them in Chromium build system was unbearable burden for Google.reply",
      "Fwiw doing a unity build with thin-lto can yield lovely results. That way you still get parallel _and_ incremental codegen.reply",
      "So, clang's modules are quite similar to clangs precompiled headers, especially the \"chained\" pchs. With PCH you have to wait on the serial PCH compilation step before you can get any parallelism, with modules you can compile each part of the \"PCH\" in parallel and anything using some subset of your dependencies can get started without waiting on things it doesn't use.Header units are basically chained PCHs. Sadly they are hard to build correctly at the moment.reply"

I then switched to working on facilitating our teams through building frameworks, teaching, and overall enabling them to quickly launch applications.Prior to that, I spent a couple years at First Orion - a smaller data company - helping found & build out a data engineering team as one of the first engineers. We were focused on building data pipelines and models to protect our users from malicious phonecalls. If you know the phrase \"Scam Likely\", we were a pioneer :)There is a noticeable gap in my resume where I was dealing with health issues from 2022 - 2024, but am looking to rejoin the software industry. I'm passionate about helping others through my work, teaching, and building tools to improve the experience for end users - including other developers.reply",

That night, a priest came to see him in the dark hole into which he had been cast on the island of Ternate.
