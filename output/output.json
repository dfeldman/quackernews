The thing about firmware updates is that by definition, every bug is caused by the updater because before installing the affected version, the bug was not present. You could say that updates are the cause and the solution of all software problems. So, a lot of update bug reports that find their way to me have nothing to do with the updater per se, they just manifest themselves immediately, giving the impression that the updater is broken. But I'm getting ahead of myself, so let's start from the beginning."
