      "Power is really one of the weaknesses of the rpi family (I'm quite excited for the new pico 2 for exactly this reason - it seems like they're finally making it easy to enter a relatively deep sleep without external hardware).I built some cameras for an application like this using a Google Coral mini, whose camera is not nearly as good as the HQ cam, unfortunately, but it supports a built in suspend + wake from onboard RTC that is very easy to use and perfect for a periodic camera app - while still having enough oomph and 2GB of memory to handle a high resolution image. (You can physically hook an HQ camera up but the software pipeline doesn't exist to manage it on the coral AFAIK.)The Rpi ecosystem is a lot more mature and (sorry, friends) I trust the future availability of rpi more than I trust Google to keep delivering the coral line, but it really underscored how helpful good power support in the hw was.(Ironically, we ended up outsourcing the next version of these cameras to a firm that built them using an rpi and we just threw in a much larger battery to compensate. Which means I have a stack of 100 unopened coral dev minis + cameras looking for either good ideas or to sell to someone. Oops.)\n \nreply",
      "Interesting, I\u2019ve always run pis from wall power.

My personal laptop has everything except OneDrive disabled. YMMV and I acknowledge the default settings of letting apps insert themselves as Startup apps without user approval is not ideal. I note this is also an issue on MacOS from experience at my previous employer who issued me a Macbook which was configured as per corporate policy to have various apps including anti virus and the like loading on login to desktop.

      "As someone with zero knowledge regarding Zero Knowledge Proofs in a programming context, can someone give me a basic explanation regarding the utility? I do understand the basic principle of ZKP\u2019s, but as yet I\u2019m failing to understand how this would be applied in industry.\n \nreply",
      "It is currently possible to use ZKP's to set up via a central authority a digital cash system where the bank notes are all anonymous and all transfers are anonymous.The central authority in this scenario cannot discriminate between transactions - any function that would compare two or more transactions cannot glean any useful information that would allow to discriminate. And and security of the anonymity of past transactions will be reducible to the security of the cryptographic hash function used (the next best thing to Information-theoretic security). As for forging money, depending on what ZKP approach is used even a quantum computer will be insufficient.The central authority can still print money and can obviously shut the entire system down.It is interesting to ponder whether or not some government will decide to take such a step and surrender all control (except for the nuclear option) over how their currency is used. It will certainly boost demand for the currency.\n \nreply",
      "The way I always explain it to newcomers now is to start from digital signatures.Digital signatures are useful, we all know that, now imagine if you could sign not only data, but also computation result. As in \u201cI ran this code with these inputs and it produced that output\u201d.If you imagine that this would work, and it takes less time to verify that signature than running the program myself, you have a succinct proof.If in addition you can hide some of the inputs you used, then you have a zero knowledge proof.So ZKPs are \u201cstronger\u201d signatures as they can sign more than data. Sometimes a signature is enough, sometimes you need more. Sometimes you need privacy so you verify a signature inside a ZKP :D\n \nreply",
      "The most common example in the talks I've been to have been for verifying anonymous voting amongst a group that you want to verify is valid to vote in the process. ZKPs allow for doing this without needing a central authority to attest to the person's credentials.But it is early days and I think there's going to be many more use cases in the future around data privacy. Take an example of credit bureaus. What if instead of a lender sending over all the personally identifiable information needed to do a lookup it could instead send a ZKP to prove it knows enough information about an individual to be authorized to retrieve their record, meaning instead of sending SSN, DOB, Address, Phone, Name, they could instead just send enough specific values in the hash of a combo of some of those fields to prove that the full hash is known but without exposing the full hash itself (along with the existing shared secret to have authorization do lookup a value in the credit bureau in the first place).\n \nreply",

      "Imagine you are Goldman Sachs and a client wants to make a 100mm USD wire transfer to one of their accounts at Citibank. How does citibank know that the account at GS has the money to cover this transfer?Right now, the way this works is essentially through a lot of trust and some guarantees by the fed. This has some downsides: because you need a lot of confirmations, it makes transfers take longer. Also, small players can't really get in on this system, so some regional banks are at a disadvantage.How do you make this safer and more robust? GS obviously can't send info on all of its clients accounts and balances to Citi. You could imagine a protocol where the client/GS sends Citi a zkp to prove that the client has the money (as long as all inputs are agreed upon).Of course, you don't really need zkps. You could also have the fed keep a database on all money in all accounts (like they do in Brazil), so that the bank only has to ask the central bank to give you an ok. But that is a whole lot of power in the hands of a central authority, as well as a single point of failure, which is something banking systems should avoid imo\n \nreply",

      "I know my comment will sound too cynical or not well-received in a startup incubator forum. However, what I observed in common with the founders of the B2B startups I worked on was good networking.The board members and initial contacts have much to do with the initial clients and the network effect it creates. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have an excellent product. Without the initial boost of early adopters, you\u2019ll struggle to survive. That\u2019s why many founders go to SV or well-known startup incubators: the networking it creates is priceless. Of course, you\u2019ll need to create a valuable product -and that\u2019s the problem of many opportunistic startups leveraging current trends. Many startup pieces of advice I read seem to ignore the fact that you need money and contacts to have visibility in the right places (SV, elite university/circle).While Paul Graham is a legend and I look forward to learning from his experiences, I believe that people in a position of privilege tend to overlook the advantages that come with their position.For example, it is true that Steve Jobs started in a garage. However, both Apple founders were living in the epicenter of computing companies at the time. They both worked at HP and had contacts with people at Stanford. If you had built a personal computer in a garage in Latin America at that time, it would have been like a tree falling in the middle of nowhere.\n \nreply",

      "Yes, you are right. The article discusses scaling. I got fixated on the concept of \"founder mode\" because the article invites a discussion about its meaning. My example involving Steve Jobs doesn\u2019t apply to scaling, but without moving forward from the company's initial stages, there isn't anything to scale. I think initial networking also plays a vital role in decision-making during growth. For example, Steve Jobs' contacts with Xerox Parc greatly influenced the creation of Apple's Lisa, and Mac.So, a book on \"founder mode\" could include multiple chapters on leveraging your network to scale your company.\n \nreply",

At my current company, I see the CEO doing the exact same thing, which gives me great hope.  Huge contrast from my previous start-up, for which I have great anti-hope unfortunately.  (Current company is Zap Surgical Systems, with Dr. John Adler as the founder.)  I've seen John everywhere, all day every day.  I've seen him literally on his hands and knees under our robotic treatment table back in the engineering lab, discussing details with a young mechanical engineer.  And yeah, we are curing cancer ;-)To re-iterate:  What I believe PaulG is saying is that there is a crucially important phenomenon that we don't yet understand, and naming it will facilitate the process of bringing it into focus so that we can help more companies be successful.His footnote has a painful resonance:  \"I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start misusing it.\"This is exactly what has happened to the Agile methodology.\n \nreply",
      "I don\u2019t believe it is that mysterious or revolutionary. What PG is describing is the \u201coptimization of local maximum\u201d problem.Founders focus on the strategic goal. Managers focus on tactical goals. Rules and processes are put in place to efficiently achieve these tactical goals. The problem is, in certain situations, these local process are at odds with the broader goal. Only the Founder has the authority to break the bureaucratic rules.My favorite example is from the film Zulu when the British quartermaster  adamantly dispenses ammo per the rule book and a long queue of desperate soldiers form up. Nevermind the British were out numbered 10 or 20 to 1 and should be firing their rifles as quickly as possible and using up all their ammo as quickly as possible.https://youtu.be/8xjCX_TXkyU\n \nreply",

      "But it does make it more difficult to talk about a concept when it's been (re)defined and argued about and gaslit about instead of what PaulG is doing: providing a simple definition backed by some real-world examples that actually are founder-mode being done more or less right.\n \nreply",

      "The GitHub repo README gives a better sense of the capabilities of the pgstream system: https://github.com/xataio/pgstream?tab=readme-ov-file#archit...For deployments at a more serious scale, it seems they support buffering WAL events into Kafka, similar to Debezium (the current leader for change data capture), to de-couple the replication slot reader on the Postgres side throughput from the event handlers you deliver the events to.Pgstream seems more batteries-included compared to using Debezium to consume the PG log; Kafka is optional with pgstream and things like webhook delivery and OpenSearch indexing are packaged in, rather than being a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d game with Kafka Streams middleware ecosystem jungle. If their offerings constraints work for your use-case, why not prefer it over Debezium since it seems easier? I\u2019d rather write Go than Java/JVM-language if I need to plug into the pipeline.However at any sort of serious scale you\u2019ll need the Kafka in there, and then I\u2019m less sure you\u2019d make use of the other plug and play stuff like the OpenSearch indexer or webhooks at all. Certainly as volume grows webhooks start to feel like a bad fit for CDC events at the level of a single row change; at least in my brief Debezium CDC experience, my consumer pulls batches of 1000+ changes at once from Kafka.The other thing I don\u2019t see is transaction metadata, maybe I shouldn\u2019t worry much about it (not many people seem to be concerned) but I\u2019d like my downstream consumer to have delayed consistency with my Postgres upstream, which means I need to consume record changes with the same transactional grouping as in Postgres, otherwise I\u2019ll probably never be consistent in practice: https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/internal-consiste...\n \nreply",

      "Implementing webhook deliveries is one of those things that's way harder than you would initially imagine. The two things I always look for in systems like this are:1. Can it handle deliveries to slow on unreliable endpoints? In particular, what happens if the external server is deliberately slow to respond - someone could be trying to crash your system by forcing it to deliver to slow-loading endpoints.2. How are retries handled? If the server returns a 500, a good webhooks system will queue things up for re-delivery with an exponential backoff and try a few more times before giving up completely.Point 1. only matters if you are delivering webhooks to untrusted endpoints - systems like GitHub where anyone can sign up for hook deliveries.2. is more important.https://github.com/xataio/pgstream/blob/bab0a8e665d37441351c... shows that the HTTP client can be configured with a timeout (which defaults to 10s https://github.com/xataio/pgstream/blob/bab0a8e665d37441351c... )From looking at https://github.com/xataio/pgstream/blob/bab0a8e665d37441351c... it doesn't look like this system handles retries.Retrying would definitely be a useful addition. PostgreSQL is a great persistence store for recording failures and retry attempts, so that feature would be a good fit for this system.\n \nreply",
      "I think retries are sketchy. Sometimes they really are necessary, but sometimes the API can be designed around at-most-once semantics.Even with a retry scheme, unless you are willing to retry indefinitely, there is always the problem of missed events to handle. If you need to handle this anyway, it might as well use this assumption to simplify the process and not attempt retries at all.From a reliability perspective, it is hard to monitor whether the delivery is working if there is a variable event rate. Instead, designing it to have a synchronous endpoint the web hook server can call periodically to \u201ccatch up\u201d has better reliability properties. Incidentally, this scheme handles at-most-once semantics pretty well, because the server can periodically catch up on all missed events.\n \nreply",
      "That's a good call: having a \"catch me up\" API you can poll is a very robust way of dealing with missed events.Implementing robust retries is a huge favor you can do for your clients though: knowing that they'll get every event delivered eventually provided they return 200 codes for accepted events and error codes for everything else can massively simplify the code they need to write.\n \nreply",
      ">a good webhooks system will queue things up for re-delivery with an exponential backoff and try a few more times before giving up completely.Microsoft's Graph API also requires consumers to re-register webhooks every N days, a kind of \"heartbeat\" to make sure the webhooks aren't sent to a dead server forever.\n \nreply",
      "Really any time you're using a distributed system, you should ask yourself, do I need retries? Do I need circuit breakers? Do I need rate limits?The answers are probably either \"yes\" or \"yes, but not yet.\"\n \nreply",

      "Lotsa big words here.The key sentence: \"Low intrinsic electrical conductivities are obtained by utilizing electrically conductive ceramics made from reaction-bonded silicon carbide.\"The basic idea seems to be to make some kind of mesh/foam that will survive high temperatures, is conductive, and contains the catalyst for the desired reaction. Then the mesh/foam can be heated inductively, and you get good contact between the hot catalyst and the reactants.I'd never heard of silicon carbide ceramic foams before, but they are apparently a common industrial product.[1] Alibaba has many suppliers. They're useful for filters that have to survive high temperatures. The process by which they're made allows adding other materials to the foam, so you can get a material with your catalyst and a nice big surface to volume ratio. That, too, is a known idea.[2] Now somebody has to try it at pilot plant scale for various processes that use catalysts and heat.

      "You generally want to minimize the number of passwords you manage; for instance, you should generally be paying the SSO tax and getting as many services as you can onto OIDC. After that, just do the cloud version of 1Password, which is easy to audit and manage access for, which you'll thank yourself for when it comes time to SOC2.Remember, as you give people access to passwords, that those passwords will need to be rotated when those people change to incompatible roles or depart the company. If passwords aren't a total pain in the ass for you, you're probably doing something wrong.\n \nreply",

      "And when you set up 1Password, make sure you also get the CLI going, so passwords & shared gunk that's needed to access other people's services can be scripted, and when the passwords, etc get rotated no-one needs to know because no-one needs to store them.\n \nreply",

      "That is the answer.SSO, then password manager.I'd strongly recommend bitwarden, having deployed and managed it. I would warn against lastpass, strongly, due to papercut level issues everywhere. I haven't used 1password in an appropriate scenario to comment on it.\n \nreply",
      "Don't. Give them access to all systems they need with their own user/password. That way you can revoke them (if/when necessary) without disrupting everyone else.Also automate as much as is reasonable, e.g. github access to push code to a dev branch, then enqueue merging of it. But a CI/CD pipeline does the actual deploy, the employee doesn't need to access any of the production systems. A very small number still will, but that's a much better situation.Give the employee 1Password to manage their own passwords.\n \nreply",
      "I agree with this. But I want to ask a similar question as OP but for services. How do you handle service account credentials in a good way? Typically multiple engineers need to be able to test out a given service account. So a number of users need to have access to the credentials of that service account. And you need a good way to enroll a new service to service connection, i.e give a service account access to another service.I haven't seen this done in a way that didn't feel overly complex, prone to error and oversharing of secrets.\n \nreply",
      "You need to be able to automate 3 things:   1. Account pass retrieval\n   2. Account pass rotation\n   3. Account pass ref update\n\n(1) is how a user gets the pass when needed (normal process or break glass debug). (2) is how the pass rotates to an unknown value, automatically, after the user is done with it. (3) is how the new value gets updated in references, without the user knowing the new value.At the root of any solution are answers to those 3 needs.\n \nreply",
      "> the credentials of that service accountWhy do these accounts only have a single user/password?In any case, my answer would again be automation. Script the test, have the authorized process test out the service account on behalf of any employee who can create and run those tests.\n \nreply",
      "Because that's just how some products are set up. Not every external service account provides separate passwords for different employees, there's just a single corporate account that some certain number of people need to have access to.And automation isn't an answer to that. The question is how to share the password in the first place, not to automate what is done with it.\n \nreply"

Software design is an evolutionary process, and I think professional tablet software is still pretty stunted in that department. Largely down to Apple's endless resistance against allowing the iPad to be used as a computer rather than a media appliance.The more stuff we get like this, the sooner we can collectively work out how to work around the shortcomings (no guaranteed keyboard, poor feature discoverability of touch-first UIs) and lean into the positives (handheld, ultraportable, direct manipulation).It's crazy that we've had the iPad for 14 years and tablet computers in general much longer than that but we seemingly still haven't worked it out yet.
