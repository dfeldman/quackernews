      "I used Affinity for several years, so to add some background here:Serif is the company that originally built this software.--------2014\u20132024Serif developed the Affinity suite, a collection of three independent desktop apps sold with a one-time payment model:- Affinity Designer: vector graphic design (Adobe Illustrator equivalent)- Affinity Photo: digital image editing (Adobe Photoshop equivalent)- Affinity Publisher: print and layout design (Adobe InDesign equivalent)They were solid, professional tools without subscriptions like Adobe, a big reason why many designers loved them.-------2024Canva acquired Serif.-------2025 (today)The product has been relaunched. The three apps are now merged into a single app, simply called Affinity, and it follows a freemium model.From what I\u2019ve tested, you need a Canva account to download and open the app (you can opt out of some telemetry during setup).The new app has four tabs:- Vector: formerly Affinity Designer- Pixel: formerly Affinity Photo- Layout: formerly Affinity Publisher- Canva AI: a new, paid AI-powered sectionScreenshot https://imgur.com/a/h1S6fcKHope can help!reply",
      "This is such a shame IMO. The Serif suite was great, and I used to try to get every designer I could to dump adobe and switch to serif.Now that it has switched to a freemium model trying to get you to subscribe to AI, I wont be using this or telling other people about it any more. Their priorities have changed. No longer are they trying to to beat adobe at their own game, they are just chasing AI money like everyone else.reply",
      "I think it's really cool they can get AI money from the people who want to pay that, to give away the core for free. I can empathize with feeling their focus will be elsewhere (whatever increases revenue) but I figure AI isn't magic, they need to have the rest of the creative suite work well to, yaknow, synergizeEdit: I'll add that I much prefer purchasing perpetual licenses for software that can work without a cloud component. Opus, Sublime, Mathematica, totally agree that paying for software aligns incentives. But if it is online, it's a SaaS, and they can't very well offer you cloud services forever at a one time cost.

      "In the early days of the Internet, there was this website with a list of payphone numbers from all over the United States. In my state, there were only three entries, and my home phone number was one of them. It was listed as being outside a publicly traded chain restaurant.On occasion, radio stations would do bits where they would call a random payphone from the website. My house was called 3 times for the same bit by different radio stations. Within a month apart, I spoke to two different stations from New Zealand. MoreFM was one of them, but I don't remember the other. I do remember that that were very disappointed when I told them I had just spoken to MoreFM a month prior. Also MoreFM was the only station that didn't end the bit when I explained it was not a pay phonereply",

      "To summarize: the ear does not do a Fourier transform, but it does do a time-localized frequency-domain transform akin to wavelets (specifically, intermediate between wavelet and Gabor transforms). It does this because the sounds processed by the ear are often localized in time.The article also describes a theory that human speech evolved to occupy an unoccupied space in frequency vs. envelope duration space. It makes no explicit connection between that fact and the type of transform the ear does\u2014but one would suspect that the specific characteristics of the human cochlea might be tuned to human speech while still being able to process environmental and animal sounds sufficiently well.A more complicated hypothesis off the top of my head: the location of human speech in frequency/envelope is a tradeoff between (1) occupying an unfilled niche in sound space; (2) optimal information density taking brain processing speed into account; and (3) evolutionary constraints on physiology of sound production and hearing.reply",
      "Yeah, this article feels like it's very much setting up a ridiculous strawman.Nobody who knows anything about signal processing has ever suggested that the ear performs a Fourier transform across infinite time.But the ear does perform something very much akin to the FFT (fast Fourier transform), turning discrete samples into intensities at frequencies -- which is, of course, what any reasonable person means when they say the ear does a Fourier transform.This article suggests it's accomplished by something between wavelet and Gabor. Which, yes, is not exactly a Fourier transform -- but it's producing something that is about 95-99% the same in the end.And again, nobody would ever suggest the ear was performing the exact math that the FFT does, down to the last decimal point. But these filters still work essentially the same way as the FFT in terms of how they respond to a given frequency, it's really just how they're windowed.So if anyone just wants a simple explanation, I would say yes the ear does a Fourier transform. A discrete one with windowing.reply",
      "Since we're being pedantic, there is some confusion of ideas here (even though you do make a valid overall point), and the strawman may not be as ridiculous.First, I think when you say FFT, you mean DFT. A Fourier transform is both non-discrete and infinite in time. A DTFT (discrete time fourier transform) is discrete, i.e. using samples, but infinite. A DFT (discrete fourier transform) is both finite (analyzed data has a start and an end) and discrete. An FFT is effectively an implementation of a DFT, and there is nothing indicating to me that hearing is in any way specifically related to how the FFT computes a DFT.But more importantly, I'm not sure DFT fits at all? This is an analog, real-world physical process, so where is it discrete, i.e. how does the ear capture samples?I think, purely based upon its \"mode\", what's happening is more akin to a Fourier series, which is the missing fourth category completing (FT, DTFT, DFT): Continuous (non-discrete), but finite or rather periodic in time.But secondly, unlike Gabor transforms, wavelet transforms are specifically not just windowed Fourier anythings (whether FT/FS/DFT/DTFT). Those would commonly be called \"short-time Fourier transforms\" (STFT, existing again in discrete and non-discrete variants), and the article straight up mentions that they don't fit either in its footnotes.Wavelet transforms use an entirely different shape (e.g. a haar wavelet) that is shifted and stretched for analysis, instead of windowed sinusoids over a windowed signal.And I think those distinctions are what the article actually wanted to touch upon.reply",
      "Don\u2019t neurons fire in bursts? That\u2019s sort of discrete I guess.reply",
      "Even if they do (and I honestly have no idea), isn't it the frequency, i.e. the output of the basilar membrane in the ear, and not a sample in time of the actual sound wave which would correspond to a short-time frequency transform, that gets sampled here?And the basilar membrane seems like a pretty un-discrete (in time, not in frequency) process to me. But I'm not 100% sure.Sure, if you go small enough, you end up with discrete structures sooner or later (molecules, atoms, quantum if you go far down enough and everything breaks apart anyway), but without knowing anything, the sensitivity of this whole process still seems better modeled as continuous rather than discrete, the scale at which that happens seems just too small to me.reply",
      "going all the way out to percept, the response of the system is non-linear: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scalethis is believed to come from the shape of the cochlea, which is often modeled as a filterbank that can express this non-linearity in an intuitive way.reply",
      "I was also thinking of refractory periods with neurotransmitters. But I don't know much about this.reply",
      "It's a good question, but as elaborated in a sibling comment, I'm not sure it even matters in this case. (Sampling frequency vs. sampling the sound wave itself.)reply",
      ">  At high frequencies, frequency resolution is sacrificed for temporal resolution, and vice versa at low frequencies.this is the time-frequency uncertainty principle. intuitively it can be understood by thinking about wavelength. the more stretched out the waveform is in time, the more of it you need to see in order to have a good representation of its frequency, but the more of it you see, the less precise you can be about where exactly it is.> but it does do a time-localized frequency-domain transform akin to waveletsmaybe easier to conceive of first as an arbitrarily defined filter bank based on physiological results rather than trying to jump directly to some neatly defined set of orthogonal basis functions. additionally, orthogonal basis functions cannot, by definition, capture things like masking effects.> A more complicated hypothesis off the top of my head: the location of human speech in frequency/envelope is a tradeoff between (1) occupying an unfilled niche in sound space; (2) optimal information density taking brain processing speed into account; and (3) evolutionary constraints on physiology of sound production and hearing.(4) size of the animal.notably: some smaller creatures have supersonic vocalization and sensory capability, sometimes this is hypothesized to complement visual perception for avoiding predators, it also could just have a lot to do with the fact that, well, they have tiny articulators and tiny vocalizations!reply",

      "That gives me a quite literal flashback.Back in the Macromedia Flash 5 days (25 years ago!), Robert Penner popularized the easing concept. I can't imagine the void we had before that. I clearly remember me starring at the formulas in ActionScript 1.0 (see [1]) without any chance of understanding them - but usage was clear, easy and fun!Those formulas basically generated the required tweening numbers mathematical (comparable to the Bezier approach mentioned in the article). That's a much different concept to the linear interpolation described in the linked blog article where you pass in a static list of numbers. The more complex your curve the more numbers you need. That's when the author links to the external tool  \"Linear() Easing Generator\" by Jake Archibald and Adam Argyle. It was a fresh and nice reading even though animations are less a topic for me then it was back with Flash.Here an example of an easing function from the linked source file. \nThe tween executing function would pass in time (t) and other parameters I can't name to calculate the resulting value continuously.  Math.easeInOutBack = function (t, b, c, d, s) {\n      if (s == undefined) s = 1.70158; \n      if ((t/=d/2) < 1) return c/2*(t*t*(((s*=(1.525))+1)*t - s)) + b;\n      return c/2*((t-=2)*t*(((s*=(1.525))+1)*t + s) + 2) + b;\n  };\n\nIf you want to dig deeper, visit roberpenner's easing overview [2] with some resources.

A physics engine would maintain the illusion, and could be simpler to specify:    transition: physics(system=gravity, force=10, bounce=on, dampening=3)\n    transition: physics(system=spring, force=5, bounce=off, dampening=5)reply",

It isn't easy to make a simple interface in the same way that Pascal apologized for writing a long letter because he didn't have time to write a shorter one.Implementing the UI for one exact use case is not much trouble, but figuring out what that use case is difficult.   And defending that use case from the line of people who want \"that + this little extra thing\", or the \"I just need ...\" is difficult.

So this yaml needs to be parsed and interpreted and the applied to the target data.

      "> Several experts described the mechanism as a \u201cclever\u201d workaround that could comply with the letter of the law but not its spirit. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of brilliant, but it\u2019s risky,\u201d said a former senior US security official.If it wasn't Amazon, Google and Israel government, there wouldn't be people pretending it comply with the 'letter of the law'. It is simple treason, selling your own country secret to another.And the way it's done isn't that 'brilliant'. Oh yes they aren't writing on paper that x country asked for Israel data, they are instead using the country phone index and making payment based on that...reply",
      "> officials created a secret warning system: the companies must send signals hidden in payments to the Israeli government, tipping it off when it has disclosed Israeli data to foreign courts or investigators.> The terms of the Nimbus deal would appear to prohibit Google and Amazon from the kind of unilateral action taken by Microsoft last month, when it disabled the Israeli military\u2019s access to technology used to operate an indiscriminate surveillance system monitoring Palestinian phone calls.I don\u2019t understand the connection between these two things. The article seems all over the place.reply",
      "Isn\u2019t there a legal term for this?It is like if it is illegal to import more then $1000 into the country without declaring, and you (clever) give $900 each to 4 of your friends who are conveniently traveling with you, so you only walk across the border with remaining $400, not breaking any laws. Then when inside the country, your friends give you back the $900 each, meaning you just de-facto imported $4000 while technically crossing the border with less then $1000, as legally required.If normal people tried to do this they would obviously be charged with the crime of illegally importing money, but also with something like a conspiracy to evade the law.reply",
      "I don't know of a general term, but in financial crime it's generally referred to as 'structuring'. IIRC this is from US legislation but it's definitely used in several other countries. I've also heard it referred to as 'smurfing', particularly when splitting a task like purchasing items in a small enough quantity to not be suspicious.reply",

      "The method is buried about 60% through the article, but it's interesting.  It seems incredibly risky for the cloud companies to do this.  Was it agreed by some salespeople without the knowledge of legal / management?Leaked documents from Israel\u2019s finance ministry, which include a finalised version of the Nimbus agreement, suggest the secret code would take the form of payments \u2013 referred to as \u201cspecial compensation\u201d \u2013 made by the companies to the Israeli government.According to the documents, the payments must be made \u201cwithin 24 hours of the information being transferred\u201d and correspond to the telephone dialing code of the foreign country, amounting to sums between 1,000 and 9,999 shekels.If either Google or Amazon provides information to authorities in the US, where the dialing code is +1, and they are prevented from disclosing their cooperation, they must send the Israeli government 1,000 shekels.If, for example, the companies receive a request for Israeli data from authorities in Italy, where the dialing code is +39, they must send 3,900 shekels.If the companies conclude the terms of a gag order prevent them from even signaling which country has received the data, there is a backstop: the companies must pay 100,000 shekels ($30,000) to the Israeli government.reply",
      "It does seem a bit baffling. This method just adds a second potential crime, in the form of fraudulent payments.reply",
      "Why would it be fraudulent in this case? I assume that these would be paid as refunds accounted for as a discount to a particular customer - aren't these generally discretionary? Also, I would assume that it would be the Israeli government getting services from the Israeli subsidiary of that company, so it's not clear whether even if it were a crime, which jurisdiction would have an issue with it.You could argue that it's against something like the OECD Anti\u2011Bribery Convention, but that would be a much more difficult case, given that this isn't a particular foreign official, but essentially a central body of the foreign government.Just to clarify, not saying that it's ok, but just that accusing it of being a \"crime\" might be a category error.reply"

      "I've been looking for this exact thing. A couple questions:Are your agents good at testing other agents? e.g. I want your agent to ask our agent a few questions and complete a few UI interactions with the results.How do you handle testing onboarding flows? e.g. I want your agent to create a new account in our app (https://www.definite.app/) and go thru the onboarding flow (e.g. add Stripe and Hubspot as integrations).reply",
      "> Are your agents good at testing other agents? e.g. I want your agent to ask our agent a few questions and complete a few UI interactions with the results.I'd say this is one of our strong suits I think, specifically the UIs tend to be easy to navigate for browser agents, and the LLM as a judge offers pretty good feedback on chat quality and it can inform later actions. (I'd be remiss not to mention though that a good LLM eval framework like Braintrust is probably the best first line though)> How do you handle testing onboarding flows?We can step through most onboarding flows if you start from logged out state & give the context it'll need (i.e. a stripe test card, etc.) That said though, setting up integrations that require multi-page hops is still a pain point in our system and leaves a lot to be desired.Would love to talk more about your specific case and see if we can help! founders@propolis.techreply",
      "Looks interesting! How it would work in terms of latencies? Also, would you be able to run on CI, or even with ephemeral envs? From my experience it is key to be able to run it on each change.reply",
      "Neat! How do you handle state changes during tests, for example, in a todo app the agents are (likely) working on the same account in parallel or even as a subsequent run, some test data has been left behind or now data is not perhaps setup for a test run.I\u2019m curious if you\u2019d also move into API testing too using the same discovery/attempt approach.reply",
      "This is one of our biggest challenges, you're spot on! What we're working on taking this includes a memory layer that agents have access to - thus state changes become part of their knowledge and accounted for while conducting a test.They're also smart enough to not be frazzled by things having changed, they still have their objectives and will work to understand whether the functionality is there or not. Beauty of non-determinism!reply",
      "Can it find broken UI?Human can find and report broken UI easily by using common sense.Even though it is simple for human. Computer has no common sense and I am a machine learning expert. I tried and mostly failed to build a broken UI detector in my previous company. They had automated plugin upgradable process. That periodically broke UI.I tried to detect it my taking long screenshot, and you could select a image as working version, then later finding diff between 2 images. I kind of worked but not satisfactory.reply",
      "The agents can definitely detect when something is off, given they're using VLMs. They don't necessarily compare it to previous versions, rather they have opinionated takes on whether something looks broken / off. So - yes!reply",
      "Hey I'm Matt! Really excited to answer any questions.To elaborate a little bit on the \"canary\" comment --For a while at Airtable I was on the infra team that managed the deploy (basically click run and then sit and triage issues for a day), One of my first contributions on the team was adding a new canary analysis framework that made it easier to catch and rollback bugs automatically. Two things always bothered me about the standard canary release process:1) It necessarily treats some users as lower value, and thus more acceptable to risk exposing bugs to (this makes sense for things like free-tier, etc. but the more you segment out, the less representative and thus less effective your canary is). When every customer interaction matters (as is the case for so many types of businesses) this approach is harder to justify2) Low frequency / high impact bugs are really difficult to catch in canary analysis. While it\u2019s easy to write metrics that catch glaring drops/spikes in metrics, more subtle high impact regressions are much harder and often require user reports (which we did not factor in as part of our canary). Example: how do you write a canary metric that auto rolls back when an enterprise account owner (small % of overall users) logs in and a broken modal prevents them from interacting with your website.I view what we\u2019re building at Propolis as an answer to both of these things. I envision a deploy process (very soon) that lets us roll out to simulated traffic and canary on THAT before you actually hit real users (and then do a traditional staged release, etc.)reply",
      "seems like you are misappropriating what canaries are useful and used for... they are designed to be lightweight and shallow... hence the name and whole analogy, canaries never were meant to determine if a mine was structurally unsafe etcreply",
      "fraud/abuse/compliance is a good usecase for this kinda thing - an abuse vector is kinda like a bug, except that the system does what its expected to do.testing for abuse stuff ive always found quite difficult, since to work well, you need to both create some real resources so you can delete/clean them up, and also you need to create a new test identity, since your abuse detection system should be deny listing found bad actors. the difficulty is that those sessions probably want to be open for like a week, so they can process both payments and refunds.can the agents check their email? other notification methods?reply"

      "At some point customer service died. Businesses of seem to no longer be interested in dealing with customers. Good customers come in all shapes and sizes, and often don't exactly fit a cookie cutter. It's frustrating to see businesses just cut and run the moment something becomes a problem that needs more than a series of pre-scripted responses to be resolved.reply",
      "There was a time when the general consensus was that treating customers well would result in greater retention, which, in turn, would ultimately prove to be net positive profit-wise over time.It seems like that changed somewhere around the turn of the century, whereby businesses started to decide that it was better to cut down on customer service, and in some cases, go so far as to ban customers.  The first cases of this I recall reading about had to do with Best Buy, and specifically their policy of banning people from their stores who made a lot of returns.I'm not really sure how it ultimately maths out - i.e., whether it's long-term optimal to drop troublesome customers or merely short-term optimal, and this was primarily taken from the perspective of retail.As such, I'm sure the math changes a little for subscription services.  However, I also recall my prior employer's support activity followed a power law distribution across its clients, so it wouldn't surprise me if a policy to drop particularly noisy clients is a net savings there as well.reply",
      "That's what you get for the low cost of entry. When most customers are self-signup (and probably low margin) there's no individual responsible for them.Good in that you never have to speak to a salesperson, bad in that there will be no-one to take care of you if things go sideways.reply",
      "On one hand, this makes me incredibly sad.  It means that all of us, as consumers, agreed we'd rather save a buck than get acceptable service.On the other hand, as someone who did customer service in my younger years, 95% of calls were PEBKAC, so it's essentially a giant money drain for things of no real concern to you as a company.I've often wondered how successful it would be to charge $3 or $5 per call, refunding the money in cases said call was needed.reply",
      "The worst customer service is usually for things where you don't have a choice, like when your mortgage gets sold to a new servicer.reply",
      "In principle I agree with the concept of charging for support and refunding if the issue is not at the customer's end.  I'd certainly be fine with that myself, even if it cost $50 or so to get a responsible human on the line when there's trouble with a service like banking, payments, or business-critical SaaS providers.I think Microsoft tried that at one point, but they didn't stick with it for some reason.

      "I think people are rightly skeptical of intuitions for the obvious reason-- they are shortcuts that don't come with easy verification that the \"intuiter\" knows (and can effectively communicate) the chain of reasoning that led to the conclusion. So you can't tell from the stated intuition whether the corresponding chain of reasoning is correct (or, for any non-trivial intuition, even if there exists a corresponding chain of reasoning at all).reply",
      "I do think intuitions are a necessary source of pushback against philosophical skepticism, and am in favor of a kind of spirit of incredulity in response to skepticism. People pretend they are Cartesian skeptics for 15 minutes in a conversation, or a classroom, but go right back on to being a person after the conversation is over.But on the other hand, I think a lot of disasters in philosophy come from having a failure of imagination, mistaking it for an insight into necessity and calling that an \"intuition.\"So I don't know that one should have a transcendent attitude toward all intuitions, I think it depends. Lance Bush is interested in moral intuitions and generally (imo) a great philosopher with great instincts, but I think what intuitions we do or don't have about morality are important, and I wouldn't want to wave those away because anglosphere philosophers have a bad track record with intuitions leading them astray when it comes to Mary's Room or the Chinese Room (what is it with rooms).reply"

Of course, there are many ways to pick up this further understanding: taking note of where and how such results are used, doing carefully designed exercises, and so on. Nevertheless, it is often the case that more could be done to help people recognise the signs that indicate that a particular result can be applied.This article, which is principally aimed at undergraduates early on in a mathematics degree, is inspired by an experience I myself had as an undergraduate.
