      "I think this must be a very stupid question, but I\u2019ll ask it anyway. I always thought the Soviet Union was smaller than the US population wise, and really did punch above their weight. But Soviet Union census of 1970 lists 241,720,134 people, while the US census of 1970 lists 203,392,031 people.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Soviet_censushttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_United_States_censusIs this statistic somehow not representative?If so, what\u2019s up with that?If not, is the belief that the Soviet Union was smaller than the US population widespread and wrong? If it is widespread and wrong, where\u2019s it come from? (Although, I must admit the possibility that it isn\u2019t widespread, and was just unusually wrong. In which case the answer is just that I\u2019m unusually bad at geopolitics, which would not be surprising at all).\n \nreply",

      "The author raises an interesting question as to how the Soviets produced so much scientific talent, but his discussion of math circles strikes me as more of a tangent than a convincing answer. Were these math circles really so widespread, and were they a big part of producing mathematical and scientific question? He doesn't address this. However, the book he is reviewing is available online [1] and I see from skimming it that Zvonkin says only one of his students ultimately chose math as a profession. My hunch is that the structure of the formal education system in the USSR played a larger role.[1] https://sites.icmc.usp.br/sasha_a/zvonkin-e.pdf\n \nreply",

Sure they managed to actually build then which is far from trivial, but so did the UK and France and they're much smaller countries. This is just to name one example of how the Soviet Union scientific abilities are often exaggerated.\n \nreply",

My Ti-Lite (one of the most popular lightweight chair brands) Aero Z starts at $3k and goes up quickly with wheels and backrest and casters and various other options that I need for sitting 16 hours a day without creating more problems.

Most plans don't cover DME 100%.What Zack and Cambry are doing is great.(edit) I\u2019d like to add that I think part of being able to drive costs down is that they\u2019re not offering these via insurance so they sidestep the need for FDA approval to market it as a medical device (hence the company name), CMS approval and HCPCS coding and all the regulatory costs that come with that.Now don't get me started on power wheelchair cost...\n \nreply",

      "> anti-curiosity and anti-learningYou nailed it. If I could go a bit deeper, I think the drive-by cynicism comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of people.Statistically, you are probably not significantly smarter or dumber than most people you meet. In other words, someone who has spent months or years on a problem probably knows more about it than you do if you\u2019re just now reading about it.

Yes, there are still many businesses/services that have critical components written in scala but current mindshare has cratered for new projects. I only single out scala because I have spent a lot of time with it and have seen it go through the hype cycle (in 2012-14 it seemed like I was constantly seeing doing $X in scala pieces on HN and I almost never see it referenced here anymore). It's probably a natural and inevitable phenomenon (and a bit of a shame because scala did get some things right that other mainstream languages still have not).\n \nreply",

Some still stand by the technology choices made back then, while others are more open when given a chance to reflect. The general consensus is that if Kotlin had been available at the time, or if Swift had been a viable option for back-end services, they definitely wouldn\u2019t have chosen Scala for those projects.\n \nreply",

It's far from dead.What does seem to be dying are the framework-centric Play Akka, and non Airflow raw Spark jobs out there.

The music industry and its attempt to market music could be considered a type of algorithm, or even multiple algorithms. Defining and marketing genres of music \"algorithmizes\" the product I think - if genre X sells, then more musicians will try to call their music genre X and maybe even modify their product.And people who grew up in the physical medium heydays of the 60s through the mid 90s are definitely attached to their preferences.\n \nreply",

Just the basic idea of having tiny/baby steps to take is a powerful one.\"Loop Habit Tracker\" app is a great app to keep track of your habits especially the ones where you want to record yes/no responses.

      "We built LegendKeeper using Yjs! (It's a mapping app as well, but fantasy). Ended up rolling our own sync server to handle large scale multiplexing, as we have D&D game-masters with 25,000+ documents to manage. (I don't know how they do it, tbh!)We opt for the central server as a super-peer and use the Yjs differential update system to avoid loading docs in memory for too long. While there are many things about local-first that are a huge pain in the ass, the UX benefits are pretty huge. The DX can be nice too! Getting to focus on product and not on data transit (once you've got a robust sync system) is pretty sweet. The first 4 weeks of launching our Yjs-based system was rough though; lots of bugs that virally replicated between peers. It requires a really paranoid eye for defensive coding; after several years, we have multiple layers of self-healing and validation on the client.\n \nreply",

      "> Architecturally, Y-Sweet acts as a bus: clients connect to the Y-Sweet server rather than directly to each other. Whenever a client connects or makes changes, it syncs its local document with the Y-Sweet server. Y-Sweet merges the client\u2019s document into its own copy, saves it to S3 and broadcasts updates to other clients. Since CRDTs are guaranteed to eventually converge on the same state, at the end of this process all clients have the same document.I had thought that the advantage of CRDTs was you do not need a centralized server and that if you do have a central server Operational Transforms are easier. Am I missing why CRDTs are used here?\n \nreply",
      "Author here! A few thoughts on this:- First and (maybe most importantly), WebRTC in browsers requires a central server for signaling. So unless web browsers loosen that constraint, a \"true\" P2P web app without a central server is unfortunately infeasible.- My understanding is that with Operational Transforms, the server is \"special\" \u2014 it's responsible for re-ordering the clients' operations to prevent conflicts. I mention a little later in the article that Y-Sweet is just running plain Yjs under the hood. So it is a central server, but it's easily replaceable with any other instance of Y-Sweet; you could fork the code and run your own and it would work just as well.- Peers will only sync their changes if they're online at the same time. That means that the longer peers go without being online simultaneously, the more their local documents will diverge. From a user experience point of view, that means people will tend to do a lot of work in a silo and then receive a big batch of others' changes all at once \u2014 not ideal! Having a \"cloud peer\" that's always online mitigates that (this is true for any algorithm).\n \nreply",
      "The ability to run your own server--or even not requiring a bespoke set of operations--isn't a special property of a CRDT; the same thing should be doable with something like ShareJS and it's generic tree/JSON structures.FWIW, though, the author of ShareJS had said some pretty strong things pro-CRDT in the past and even kind of lamenting his work on OT, so...https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24194091\n \nreply",
      "Hi, that\u2019s me!OT would work fine to make this collaboratively editable. It\u2019s just not local first. (If that matters to you.)With an OT based system like sharejs or google docs, the server is the hub, and clients are spokes connecting to that hub. Or to put it another way, the server acts as the central source of truth. If the server goes down, you\u2019ve not only lost the ability to collaboratively edit. You've also usually lost your data too. (You can store a local copy, but sharejs not designed to be able to restore the server\u2019s data from whatever is cached on the clients).With Yjs (and similar libraries), the entire data set is usually stored on each peer the server is just one node you happen to connect to & use to relay messages. Because they\u2019re using Yjs, the author of this travel app could easily set up a parallel webrtc channel with his wife\u2019s computer (in the same house). Any edits made would be broadcast through all available pipes. Then even when they\u2019re on the road and the internet goes down, their devices could still stay in sync. And if the server was somehow wiped, you could spin up another one. The first client that connects would automatically populate the server with all of the data.But whether these local first characteristics matter to you is another question. They might be a hindrance - for commercial data, centralisation is often desirable. I can think of plenty of use cases where replicating your entire database to your customers\u2019 computers (and replicating any changes they make back!) would be a disaster. It depends on your use case.\n \nreply",
      "(One of the authors of Y-Sweet)You\u2019re right, that is one of the advantages of CRDTs, but it turns out to be hard to realize on the web \u2014 aside from RTC (which has its own dragons), you still need a server in the mix.The other thing an authoritative server solves is persisting the data. Because one server is the authority for a document at a time, you can use S3 or R2 for persistence without worrying about different servers with different versions of the document colliding and erasing each other\u2019s changes.\n \nreply",
      "Oh, this is interesting. Can you elaborate (or link to some post) about what sort of issues you run into? I find the concept of CRDTs to be very interesting, but if you still need a centralized server I question the value of them over OTs. I'd love to understand more about if this is a connectivity issue, a CRDT issue, or what.\n \nreply",
      "The main issue you run into is that the web is designed around client-server communication; you can do peer-to-peer communication in theory but because of NAT and firewalls, many of those end up not being peer to peer in the end.Plus, if you want the data to persist so that two people can collaborate even if they are never online at the same time, you need a server anyway.CRDTs as data structures support peer-to-peer, it\u2019s just that in many use cases that aspect of CRDTs is not needed.\n \nreply",
      "Okay that all makes a lot of sense thank you.\n \nreply"

I normally write posts to highlight some hidden attack surface or interesting complex vulnerability class. This time, I want to talk about a vulnerability that is neither of those things. The striking thing about this vulnerability is just how simple it is. This should have been caught earlier, and I want to explore why that didn\u2019t happen.In 2021, all good bugs need a catchy name, so I\u2019m calling this one \u201cBigSig\u201d.First, let\u2019s take a look at the bug, I\u2019ll explain how I found it and then try to understand why we missed it for so long.Network Security Services\u00a0(NSS) is Mozilla's widely used, cross-platform cryptography library. When you verify an ASN.1 encoded digital signature, NSS will create a VFYContext\u00a0structure to store the necessary data. This includes things like the public key, the hash algorithm, and the signature itself.struct\u00a0VFYContextStr\u00a0{\u00a0 \u00a0SECOidTag\u00a0hashA"
