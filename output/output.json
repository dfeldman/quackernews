      "This is unfortunate, but understood.I worked in a university research spinout US-China multinational AI hardware startup, and (without getting into confidential information, but only speaking of general engineering practice) I can mention that both nations' government concerns could be barriers.And some rules can be counterproductive for the one making the rule, even from a competitive perspective -- not even turning a win-win into a lose-lose, but turning it into a lose-win where you are the \"side\" who loses.Another thing I'd like like to say, as a US person, who interfaced throughout the org chart at the multinational startup, is that my colleagues in China, as well as those who were recent immigrants, were generally very smart and knowledgeable, and also very nice people.It's especially tragic when nations feel they have to act adversarily on tensions, because (as seen in this case) the respective individual citizens are not natural enemies, but rather, they are natural friends.  They are also valuable fellow contributors, to the shared wealth of our shared world.In recent weeks, the world is fortunate that DeepSeek has shared some of its AI advancements, even in the context of themselves being denied the latest hardware with which to work.  I hope that this sharing will continue and increase, in all directions.\n \nreply",
      "> I hope that this sharing will continue and increaseIt will continue until they pass us. They're coming from behind, and releasing models as open source essentially wipes the board of hundreds of American startups.Growth hackers and solopreneurs like @levelsio can be nipping at the heels of $300M funded companies who poured all of their points into training models, making expensive mistakes, and overpaying for compute.Companies like RunwayML are probably doomed at this point between Huntuan, Wan, and the half dozen other open source foundation video models. They failed to raise their last round in 2024, and they definitely face a much bleaker world in 2025.\n \nreply",

      "It's already been happening for years. Award winning faculty and scientists are fleeing US universities and institutions and setting up shop in China, often with more funding and talent available, and no McCarthyism accusations of being spies. It started officially in 2018 with the US Department of Justice's \"China Initiative\", which basically just allowed anyone to go on a witch hunt of Chinese and Chinese American academics. Of course, the vast majority of those cases were bogus and was just a guise for racism.This isn't the first time. In the 1950s, the founder of Berkeley JPL, an MIT professor who was one of the forefathers of NASA and Manhattan Project contributor, and who Theodore von Karman called a generational genius, Chinese educated Qian Xuesen was humiliated with accusations of being a communist spy and given a multi-year house arrest where he couldn't work so that his knowledge would fall behind the state of the art. He was then deported, and went back to China where he created the Chinese space program entirely from scratch. In China today, he's widely known as a national hero and the \"father of Chinese rocketry\". If you really want your mind blown, look up his family tree and see how many Nobels and National Science Medals are related to him.The past few years alone has seen some really high profile scientists taking their knowledge and experience with them to China. These are people who've spent 30+ years building lives here in the US, and were initially being forced out, but now are actually being lured with better pay packages and working conditions since the first wave was treated so well.

      "Congrats on delivering this fun project! I do a lot of work with synchronizing media content across devices so it\u2019s always fun to see the solutions people come up with. You probably came across them in your research, but the industry standard way of creating a synced video wall like this is with BrightSign media players. The total cost for purchasing them and the screens would for 20 displays could easily end up in the 10s of thousands, so big kudos to you guys for finding a way to make this work with recycled devices.If you are ever interested in working on some mediasync-related codebases hit me up! We hire devs to do freelance contracts fairly often.\n \nreply",
      "Thank you!I didn\u2019t get the chance to mention them in the blog post, but yes we checked out the price tags on the commercial solutions :) It\u2019s crazy! I\u2019ve always wondered how much of the cost is hardware vs software\u2026 and I would imagine professional digital signage is also designed for reliability longevity and all that.\n \nreply",
      "Reliability is a big part of it - but they are not really all that expensive for what you get IMO, especially in an enterprise context. A BrightSign is effectively a very sandboxed Linux box (you can SSH into them!) which has extremely reliable video and audio output, plus a huge amount of customizability, networking, scripting etc - plus various fleet provisioning/management software that goes with it. In terms of $/minute, the amount you pay ends up being vanishingly small IMO.Your main \u201ccheap\u201d alternative to a BrightSign is a Raspberry Pi, which is definitely cheaper, but has its own host of issues to deal with.\n \nreply",
      "By the way, you can use Chromebooks and -boxes for digital signage (and kiosk) as well if you manage them with Google Cloud.\n \nreply",
      "Is the separate box thing  because of commercial display realities? Certainly at trade shows and the like I mostly see people just plug a usb stick into the smart tv from wal-mart and play their sizzle reel off of that.Is there some incentive to not just bake a small arm computer into each display?\n \nreply",
      "I entirely work with museums, where there are lots and lots of considerations in re: rendering device. The considerations for eg a commercial display are a little different, but I don\u2019t have experience with working with those sorts of clients, so my answer is from the perspective of the media art context.Having a separate box is just good separation of concerns - you can hook it up to whatever kind of projector you like (one projector might cost as much as $100k!), or you might need to use an analog display device (eg a CRT monitor) which certainly won\u2019t have any USB/SD compatibility, in which case you will need some sort of hardware to convert signals appropriately. The separation of concerns just gives you much more flexibility.Additionally, as mentioned before, you can network the boxes, which lets you do things like creating multi-channel synchronized video art installations.Most BrightSigns also have GPIO pins on them, so I\u2019ve even done things where I\u2019ve synchronized kinetic art to the video playback.You can write entire custom applications for your brightsigns (or plugins to the BrightAuthor configuration engine) - it\u2019s just its own self contained platform, so there are a lot of benefits to having it be agnostic to the display.\n \nreply",
      "I operate a digital signage company based around the Pi. Curious what problems you run into. SD cards?\n \nreply",
      "The deprecation of OMXPlayer has been problematic for one, since I rely on some custom applications which need to be able to have some fairly precise/low latency requirements between when you tell it to start playing vs when the playback actually starts, etc. I haven\u2019t found a suitable mechanism which meets our reqs on a Pi for controlling/playing videos yet since that deprecation.The lack of a regular HDMI output is mildly annoying but not really a problem. Audio configuration is sometimes problematic, usually not\u2026If a client wants to use their own Pis, getting them provisioned with our software isn\u2019t always the easiest if the customer is techno-phobic (though that\u2019s partly on us - RPi usage is relatively infrequent for our customers so we haven\u2019t put the time/energy into docs and into baking an image etc).I love Pi\u2019s, but they just that extra bit more finicky than BrightSigns which are hyper optimized for our use case and prevalent in our customers\u2019 equipment rooms already.\n \nreply",

The Pi3 -> Pi4/5 jump was quite a massive change in how things work. I've been writing my own playback engine for 10 years now and that one was quite challenging. Precise playback start is something my software supports: You control everything in Lua and can, for example, preload a video and then start it based on either internal logic or based on an external trigger. Up to the Pi3, my software also supports dynamically adjusting the HDMI clock, so the vsyncs of multiple displays are synchronized. Customers have been using that for almost 10 years for video wall playback.If you go with the hosted version of the software, provisioning is as simple as extracting a single 60MB zip file to an empty SD card and placing that into the Pi. If needed you can even use the API to preconfigure that ZIP file to include settings like WiFi.\n \nreply",
      "Cool! I did a similar thing with 4x4 tablets, after connecting all 16 of them to ADB and a single host I was able to automate most of the stuff. The I just created 16 virtual screens on sway with 16 VNC clients and streamed it all over Wi-Fi as a test, but Wi-Fi worked so well that I did not look for more efficient solutions.For that period my PC had 19 displays, 17 of them over VNC and it was glorious. I could either do something on all of them, or dedicate each for a different purpose/program (music, htop, calendar, clock, ssh sessions)Though dealing with all the hardware was quite annoying - some throttled, some had connectivity issues, others batteries would not hold charge and so on.\n \nreply"

We can use the reactor to heat the gas and expansion nozzle to make it lase. Reactor lasers have lower efficiency than electrical lasers in almost all cases. They make up for it with having a simpler, more robust and more powerful designs per kg. Except for the liquid and gas core reactor designs, they operate at the same temperature as regular electric lasers powered by nuclear energy source. A fusion reactor can produce a lot of neutrons, which can then be converted into laser light using direct volumetric or wall pumping. Or, it can act as an extremely high temperature source of X-rays, which can power a photoionization laser. Gas"

      "Oddly, trying to occasionally place on the Advent of Code global leaderboard was the thing that got me most fluent in Python as its own language.Before that, I tended to write Python in a much more imperative style, since C++ is my main language; think for loops and appending to lists.  Thanks to AoC, I'm now addicted to comprehensions for transforming and filtering, know the standard library cold, and write much more concise, Pythonic code.\n \nreply",
      "> Who here has another language that they knew pretty well before learning Python? (most hands go up) Great! Terrific! That\u2019s a superpower you have that I can never have. I can never unlearn Python, become fluent in another language, and then learn Python again. You have this perspective that I can\u2019t have.It felt a little strange to read this. I knew many languages \"pretty well\" (or would have said so at the time) before Python, but it's been my primary programming language pretty much the entire time since I first picked it up 20 years ago. So I do have that perspective (I also spend a fair amount of time thinking about PL design in the abstract), but I don't feel \"PSL\" at all.> Does the value stored in `a` know the name of that variable?Okay, I'm stumped - in what other language would it \"know\" (I assume this means automatically recording the string \"a\" as part of the object's state in some way)? Or is this just referring to debugging information added in some environments?> Python = is like Java, it\u2019s always a reference and never a copy (which it is by default in C++).Java has primitive types, for which it is a copy. But it's more accurate IMO to attribute this as a property of names, rather than a property of assignment. Python's names (and most Java values, and some C# values) have reference semantics. Having understood that properly, saying that Python (like Java) is \"pass by assignment\" then just follows naturally, and all the usual confusion around this point vanishes. Passing an argument to a function is simply assigning it to the corresponding parameter. (C++'s idea of \"references\" in the type system is far more complex IMO - e.g. https://langdev.stackexchange.com/q/3798/_/3807#3807 .)> We have both reference counting and garbage collection in Python.This is strange phrasing, because reference counting is a garbage collection strategy. I assume that here \"garbage collection\" is meant to refer to mark-and-sweep etc. strategies that operate in a separate pass, timed independently of the explicit code. But also, the reference-counting system is a CPython implementation detail. (Although it does look like PyPy tries to emulate that, at least: https://doc.pypy.org/en/default/discussion/rawrefcount.html )> I\u2019ll translate this one to the transcript later - for now you\u2019ll have to watch it because the visual is important: explicit super.Raymond Hettinger's video is also a useful reference here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiOglTERPEo> It takes less characters in Python!This checks out, but it would be fairer to show what it looks like on the declaration side rather than just the usage side.\n \nreply",

Let me summarize the result: 1) the distinction is arbitrary and 2) people are very passionate about their personal view being considered canonically correct.

Given:\n\n            ```\n            class C:\n                param: Parameter[Param] = Param(...)\n\n            c = C(param=Param.VALUE)\n            ```\n\n            `c.param` operates as attribute accesses normally do, invoking the\n            descriptor with `instance=c` and transparently returning `Param.VALUE`.\n\n            `C.param`, on the other hand,  calls `__get__` with `instance=None`,\n            which is recognized by the overload as returning `Param` itself.\n\n            Thus `C.param.parameter_name` returns the string `param`, is typed\n            correctly, and if you need to find or update references to `param`\n            in the future, `setattr(c, C.param.parameter_name)` will be handled,\n            where `setattr(c, \"param\")` wouldn't have been.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        @overload\n        def __get__(self, instance: None, owner: type) -> Param: ...\n\n        @overload\n        def __get__(self, instance: Any, owner: type) -> _T_co: ...\n\n        def __get__(self, instance: object, owner: type) -> Param | _T_co: ...\n\n        def __set__(self, instance: object, value: Param | _T_co) -> None: ...\n\n        parameter_name: str\n        \"\"\"The parameter name this param has been assigned to.\"\"\"\n\n        def __set_name__(self, _owner: type, parameter_name: str) -> None:\n            # Descriptor protocol to capture the field name as a string for reference\n            # later.

      "As an Electron maintainer, I'll re-iterate a warning I've told many people before: Your auto-updater and the underlying code-signing and notarization mechanisms are sacred. The recovery mechanisms for the entire system are extremely painful and often require embarrassing emails to customers. A compromised code-sign certificate is close to the top of my personal nightmares.Dave and toDesktop have build a product that serves many people really well, but I'd encourage everyone building desktop software (no matter how, with or without toDesktop!) to really understand everything involved in compiling, signing, and releasing your builds. In my projects, I often make an argument against too much abstraction and long dependency chain in those processes.If you're an Electron developer (like the apps mentioned), I recommend:* Build with Electron Forge, which is maintained by Electron and uses @electron/windows-sign and @electron/osx-sign directly. No magic.* For Windows signing, use Azure Trusted Signing, which signs just-in-time. That's relatively new and offers some additional recovery mechanisms in the worst case.* You probably want to rotate your certificates if you ever gave anyone else access.* Lastly, you should probably be the only one with the keys to your update server.\n \nreply",
      "How about we don't build an auto-updater? Maybe some apps require an extremely tight coupling with a server, but we should try our best to release complete software to users that will work as close to forever as possible. Touching files on a user's system should be treated as a rare special occurrence. If a server is involved with the app, build a stable interface and think long and hard about every change. Meticulously version and maintain everything. If a server is involved, it is completely unacceptable for a server-side change to break an existing user's local application unless it is impossible to avoid - it should be seen as an absolute last resort with an apology to affected customers (agree with OP on this one).It is your duty to make sure _all_ of your users are able to continue using the same software they installed in exactly the same way for the reasonable lifetime of their contract, the package, or underlying system (and that lifetime is measured in years/decades, with the goal of forever where possible. Not months).You can, if you must, include an update notification, but this absolutely cannot disrupt the user's experience; no popups, do not require action, include an \"ignore forever\" button. If you have a good product with genuinely good feature improvements, users will voluntarily upgrade to a new package. If they don't, that is why you have a sales team.Additionally, more broadly, it is not your app's job to handle updates. That is the job of your operating system and its package manager. But I understand that Windows is behind in this regard, so it is acceptable to compromise there.We go a step further at my company. Any customer is able to request any previous version of their package at any time, and we provide them an Internet download page or overnight ship them a CD free of charge (and now USB too).\n \nreply",

If security is the concern why not use auto-updates only for security updates? Why am I gaining features I explicitly did not want, or losing the ones which were the reason I bought the software in the first place? Why does the dev think I am not capable of deciding for myself if or when to update?

      "Obesity causes many health problems, but it's also a symptom - of our poor relationship with food, of the way American society is set up around instant gratification, of the predatory nature of food manufacturers.Though treating the symptom is undeniably good, it also lets the deeper problems that lead to it go unchecked, and my fear is that it will lead to novel problems down the line. How recreational drugs are being replaced by social media is a good example of this; less harm to the body, undeniably good, but still harmful to the mind, and enabling new industries to pop up and find new ways to exploit people.To be clear my problems aren't with Ozempic, and I believe it should be researched further and, if safe (which seems to be the case), widely available. But the fact is that many nations are able to maintain healthy weight without drugs, and I think if we fail to continue asking why that is, the same societal patterns that led to self-destructive individual behavior in the first place will remain unaddressed.\n \nreply",

      "I started Tirzepatide 3-4 weeks ago. (Mostly as an experiment to understand the hype around GLP's... I don't have diabetes and only very slightly overweight at 20% body fat). Even at the lowest 2.5mg starter dose which you're only allowed to stay on for 1 month:- Extreme appetite suppression to the point where I've started calorie counting specifically to make sure that I'm eating enough. It's incredibly easy to forget to eat.- No more feelings of hunger. At all. This is somewhat depressing. Eating is no longer enjoyable and feels like a chore. I woke up hungry for the first time in a while a couple days ago and was excited - jumped out of bed and ran to eat something just for the pure joy of it. I've only felt that a few times in the past few weeks, compared to every day off the drug.- I completely stopped drinking. Have you ever been to a bar after eating a big meal at a restaurant, and had trouble drinking because you were too full from your meal? That's how I feel all the time. 1 or 2 beers and it becomes uncomfortable to have anymore.- Normally I go grocery shopping and within 3-4 days, all the \"good stuff\" (snacks) I bought are eaten. Now, since I stopped snacking and eating much less, groceries simply last way longer. <-- $$ saved in groceries significantly offsets the monthly price of the medication- My morning starbucks routine has changed from 2 food items to just 1, which alone saves me $200/mo (sorry starbucks).- Haven't noticed anything regarding impulse control outside of food. No anecdata to share on that point...After a few weeks on the drug, I'm 100% convinced that once this drug is widely available and cheap... being overweight will be a choice (choosing not to take the drug).The most important aspect of the drug that makes it work so well is it forces you to change your habits, no will power required. It also punishes you for bad eating habits. (That late night trip to McDonalds will have you feeling like shit the next day).I'm the kind of person that used to be able to order just about anything on a restaurant menu and clean my plate completely. Now I simply can't do that. It's actually kind of embarrassing being at a restaurant with friends and being completely uninterested in the food.\n \nreply",

Also, if I go to the gym, my muscles take a week to recover instead of a couple of days, because they're just not getting the glucose they need to repair themselves.I don't hear any of these complaints from GLP users though, which baffles me.

      "Hi everyone, co-founder of Mobile.dev and co-author of Maestro here . Thanks jstan for sharing Maestro and for the kind words\u2014really glad to hear it\u2019s working well for you!We built Maestro because E2E testing felt unnecessarily complicated, and we wanted something simple and powerful that anyone could use \u2014 whether you\u2019re a seasoned developer or just getting started with automation. It\u2019s been amazing to see it adopted at companies like Meta, Block, DoorDash, Stripe, and Disney, but honestly, what excites us most is seeing teams who\u2019ve never done test automation before finally get a solid strategy in place because Maestro is so easy to use and get started with.Oh, and if you\u2019re wondering \u2014 yes, it works for web testing too!We\u2019re constantly iterating and adding features, so if you\u2019ve got ideas, run into issues, or just want to chat, let me know. Always happy to hear how we can make it better.Thanks again for checking it out, and happy testing!\n \nreply",

      "haha happy to hear that :) (I created Patrol) ((and then worked on Maestro at mobile.dev briefly))I too think that for the vast majority of use cases, Maestro is the best solution.

I'd be skeptical to have all my tests stored in some SaaS that I can't even run locally (as some other solutions do)\n \nreply",

      "Have no idea what variant of LSD I last consumed, but I remember some deep feelings of profound thoughts and self-reflection quite almost instantly when the stuff \"hit\" (maybe 30-45 minutes after ingestion), I was still cognizant enough to be able to write it all down.

      "I believe it is a misapplication of entheogens to try solving \"IQ problems\" with them. I've found them to be incredibly valuable for personal development and solving \"EQ problems\" - the kind that my sober mind didn't ordinarily process much at all by default, being on the autism spectrum. Psychedelics for me allowed me to become intensely aware and attuned to the emotional and psychological state of others and allows me to imagine myself in their shoes and empathize with their struggles in life (even if entirely unrelated to anything I've ever personally experienced). This altered state of mind introduced me to an entirely new way of thinking that had led to me being a kinder, more compassionate, more considerate, more socially capable person in a persistent, lasting way that has long outlived the psychoactive effects of the psychedelics.Psychedelic culture has this notion of \"reintegration\", where in the week(s) after a trip it can take some time to fully internalize the epiphanies and lessons from the trip. During my first reintegration, I realized that I kinda used to interact with everyone in the world in a manner roughly analogous to really advanced NPCs in a role playing game I was forced into called life, and had no realization that I was doing this and lacked full appreciation for the depth of other people as human beings for the first quarter century and change of my life.Accordingly, I see psychedelics as a profound tool of interpersonal growth and development, but never the kind of thing I'd take to try solving a vexing technical problem - that's a different job that takes a different tool.PS to anyone else reading: this should not be taken as an endorsement or recommendation for anyone to attempt to procure and use psychedelics. There are serious mental health risks involved for vulnerable populations, risks of contaminated or laced products if procured from untrustworthy or disreputable sources, and more. If you are unsure of whether you're a part of certain vulnerable populations, I'd urge you to consult with a qualified, licensed therapist or mental healthcare provider to get a less-biased second opinion on whether or not you're at elevated risk, just to be sure, but remember this is just one of several risks.\n \nreply",
