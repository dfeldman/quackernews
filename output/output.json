      "To be very clear on this point - this is not related to model training.It\u2019s important in the fair use assessment to understand that the training itself is fair use, but the pirating of the books is the issue at hand here, and is what Anthropic \u201cwhoopsied\u201d into in acquiring the training data.Buying used copies of books, scanning them, and training on it is fine.Rainbows End was prescient in many ways.reply",
      "> Buying used copies of books, scanning them, and training on it is fine.But nobody was ever going to that, not when there are billions in VC dollars at stake for whoever moves fastest. Everybody will simply risk the fine, which tends to not be anywhere close to enough to have a deterrent effect in the future.That is like saying Uber would have not had any problems if they just entered into a licensing contract with taxi medallion holders. It was faster to just put unlicensed taxis on the streets and use investor money to pay fines and lobby for favorable legislation. In the same way, it was faster for Anthropic to load up their models with un-DRM'd PDFs and ePUBs from wherever instead of  licensing them publisher by publisher.reply",

      "Every time I see animation discussed by designers, they're thinking about it in terms of polish and \"delight\", and then balancing those things with perceptual latency. It's not entirely incorrect, but a couple of minor nits:1. Delight is overblown, in my opinion. I think most of the people truly delighted by fancy animation are just other designers.2. It's more useful to think about state when deciding when to animate. Could the user have trouble perceiving the change in state that just occurred? If so, then use an animation to help them visualize what happened. I believe this is the primary reason to use an animation - all others are vanity.reply",
      "> Delight is overblown, in my opinion. I think most of the people truly delighted by fancy animation are just other designers.If (and that\u2019s a big if) animation is used in moderation only when it actually communicates something and isn\u2019t an active impedence (as demonstrated in the linked post), I think it has a significant effect for users. It\u2019s just not the effect that many might expect.Meaningful, unintrusive animations are one of the myriad puzzle pieces that come together to form a positive impression. They\u2019re a sizeable chunk of that last 20% that separates \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d in users\u2019 minds. They\u2019re not strictly necessary, but between two equally good competitors they\u2019ll help one pull ahead of the other, because users come away with a stronger impression of \u201csolidness\u201d. It\u2019s not unlike how people tend to consider heft and resistance to flexing as markers of higher quality in physical products.The problem is that since a decade or so ago, UI design as a whole has veered heavily in the direction of vibes, slideshow wow factor, and \u201cbranding value\u201d (I felt a pang of nausea just writing that) and away from the volumes of well-researched best practices, and regard for good use of animation has been lost along with it.

I just figured out how to read button presses.

Inkjet OLED on silicon or reflexive monochrome LCD with RGB sequential front lighting combined with a prism system or things of that nature.IOW, those excessive feature sets isn't drawn from product concepts or user stories, they're drawn backwards from cumulative parts and engineering costs to justify MSRP. Same reasons as why almost all EVs are marketed as premium products, they can't make them cheaply so they're adding extra glitters in paint to justify price tags.If anyone could make displays smaller than a pinky fingernail at $5 that can be driven with an Arduino... then there would be lots of smart glasses that are just Bluetooth picture frames.reply",

      "Back in 2001/2002, I was charged with building a WiFi hotspot box. I was a fan of OpenBSD and wanted to slim down our deployment, which was running on Python, to avoid having to copy a ton of unnecessary files to the destination systems. I also wanted to avoid dependency-hell. Naturally, I turned to `chroot` and the jails concept.My deployment code worked by running the software outside of the jail environment and monitoring the running processes using `ptrace` to see what files it was trying to open. The `ptrace` output generated a list of dependencies, which could then be copied to create a deployment package.This worked brilliantly and kept our deployments small and immutable and somewhat immune to attack -- not that being attacked was a huge concern in 2001 as it is today. When Docker came along, I couldn't help but recall that early work and wonder whether anyone has done a similar thing to monitor file usage within Docker containers and trim them down to size after observing actual use.reply",

I mean, I get the value prop.

But it's really not that hard to set up http on vanilla Ubuntu (or God forbid, OpenBSD) and not really have issues.Sounds great if you're only running a single web server or whatever.  My team builds a fairly complex system that's comprised of ~45 unique services. Those services are managed by different teams with slightly different language/library/etc needs and preferences. Before we containerized everything it was a nightmare keeping everything in sync and making sure different teams didn't step on each others dependencies. Some languages have good tooling to help here (e.g. Python virtual environments) but it's not so great if two services require a different version of Boost.With Docker, each team is just responsible for making sure their own containers build and run. Use whatever you need to get your job done. Our containers get built in CI, so there is basically a zero percent chance I'll come in in the morning and not be able to run the latest head of develop because someone else's dev machine is slightly different from mine. And if it runs on my machine, I have very good confidence it will run on production.reply",

      "The reason why Python dominates is that modern ML applications don't exist in a vacuum. They aren't the standalone C/FORTRAN/MATLAB scripts of yore that load in some simple, homogeneous data, crunch some numbers, and spit out a single result. Rather, they are complex applications with functionality extending far beyond the number crunching, which requires a robust preexisting software ecosystem.For example, a modern ML application might need an ETL pipeline to load and harmonize data of various types (text, images, video, etc., all in different formats) from various sources (local filesystem, cloud storage, HTTP, etc.) The actual computation then must leverage many different high-level functionalities, e.g. signal/image processing, optimization, statistics, etc. All of this computation might be too big for one machine, and so the application must dispatch jobs to a compute cluster or cloud. Finally, the end results might require sophisticated visualization and organization, with a GUI and database.There is no single language with a rich enough ecosystem that can provide literally all of the aforementioned functionality besides Python. Python's numerical computing libraries (NumPy/PyTorch/JAX etc.) all call out to C/C++/FORTRAN under the hood and are thus extremely high-performance, and for functionality they don't implement, Python's C/C++ FFIs (e.g. Python.h, NumPy C integration, PyTorch/Boost C++ integration) are not perfect, but are good enough that implementing the performance-critical portions of code in C/C++ is much easier compared to re-implementing entire ecosystems of packages in another language like Julia.reply",
      "I'm in kind of a different place with it on the inference side.I've got these crazy tuned up CUDA kernels that are relatively straightforward to build in isolation and really where all the magic happens, and there's this new CUTLASS 3 stuff and modern C++ can call it all trivially.And then there's this increasingly thin film of torch crap that's just this side of unbuildable and drags in this reference counting and broken setup.py and it's a bunch of up and down projections to the real hacker shit.I'm thinking I'm about one squeeze of the toothpaste tube from just squuezing that junk out and having a nice, clean, well-groomed C++ program that can link anything and link into anything.reply"

For mild winter weather (+5 to -5\u00b0C) and 18\u00b0C in the cabin, the range drops to around 80km or so. On a sunny summer day, I can easily get about 130km on Norwegian country roads, probably more.When driving to the Netherlands in the months between March and October, the consumption has been around 8.3kW/100km. The car is light and has little tech that consumes power.Since the car has no heat pump, heating the cabin has a noticable impact on range during cold winter days.That said, it is a really good car to drive in the winter as the cabin gets warm in no-time and the windows in the front and back are heated and melts away thick ice in about a minute, even in really cold weahter! When doing normal commutes, the shorter range does not matter at all. But I would probably not drive to the Netherlands in -10\u00b0C during the winter!reply",

      "> Lack of standards: For 'L3' DC Fast Charging, the Leaf has a CHAdeMO port. Teslas and many newer EVs have NACS. Then there's CCS1 and CCS2. And charging stations are run by multiple vendors with multiple apps and payment methods. It's not like gas stations, like with Shell, BP, Buckee's, etc. where you just drive up, stick the gas nozzle in your tank, and squeeze.Afaik in Europe, CCS2 is the standard (and mandatory these days), when I rented an EV a few weeks back there was no location which didn\u2019t have it. And all the spots I tried charging at except Tesla accepted card payment (though there were a pair of times it was a struggle getting a card to work).Apps / memberships will get you cheaper prices but that\u2019s about all I saw (and I didn\u2019t bother with any of it).TBH the only things that annoyed me were implementation issues of the car (a polestar 4) as well as how overly wide it is. And that the rental company (AVIS) does not provide an AC adapter, so I was not able to charge at any wallplug even though I had the opportunity to charge the car at least twice over in all (I will likely purchase one if that remains their policy and I rent more EVs).All this is modulo it being summer and a pretty long range model so range anxiety was present but reasonably limited.reply"

      "A parenting tip for those with geeky kids:You can get some of these (like the smaller TOMY robots) for pretty cheap on eBay.  They're usually broken, but the innards of these robots are so interesting, just taking them apart is a learning experience.  TOMY was brilliant at making seemingly sophisticated toys that were actually run by a single DC motor; all the movements, sounds, sensing etc. were implemented using gears and cam shafts and other mechanisms.  A great way to learn about simple machines, and a bonus if you (or your kid) can repair them and bring a 40-year-old robot back to life.reply",
      "The original Furby was interesting on this front, I have one controlled by a Pi Zero using a motor controller and LED driver board (you need an LED for the cam position sensor, and this way I could backlight the eyes with RGBs too). Every expression the thing can make is driven by a single motor via a series of gears and cams, so it's pretty straightforward to get up and running. The main issues are that clearance is really tight and the gearbox is pretty noisy.My eventual plan is to hook it up to an LLM and use it like the world's most uncanny Alexa, but there's an issue with the audio board I've not got around to fixing yet. Got a bit sidetracked by the server software which I'm using as an excuse to learn Cats Effect properly.reply",
