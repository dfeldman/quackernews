      "You can do even faster, about 8ns (almost an additional 10x improvement) by using software perf events: PERF_COUNT_SW_TASK_CLOCK is thread CPU time, it can be read through a shared page (so no syscall, see perf_event_mmap_page), and then you add the delta since the last context switch with a single rdtsc call within a seqlock.This is not well documented unfortunately, and I'm not aware of open-source implementations of this.EDIT: Or maybe not, I'm not sure if PERF_COUNT_SW_TASK_CLOCK allows to select only user time. The kernel can definitely do it, but I don't know if the wiring is there. However this definitely works for overall thread CPU time.reply",

      "I don't think it is possible to talk about fractions of nanoseconds without having an extremely good idea of the stability and accuracy of your clock. At best I think you could claim there is some kind of reduction but it is super hard to make such claims in the absolute without doing a massive amount of prep work to ensure that the measured times themselves are indeed accurate. You could be off by a large fraction and never know the difference. So unless there is a hidden atomic clock involved somewhere in these measurements I think they should be qualified somehow.reply",
      "Stability and accuracy, when applied to clocks, are generally about dynamic range, i.e. how good is the scale with which you are measuring time. So if you're talking about nanoseconds across a long time period, seconds or longer, then yeah, you probably should care about your clock. But when you're measuring nanoseconds out of a millisecond or microsecond, it really doesn't matter that much and you're going to be OK with the average crystal oscillator in a PC.

That the issue with working on saturdays is daily standup? What happened in these years for such a change to happen?![1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19507620reply",

Occupy was after the Capital class but im not sure if they accurately zeroed in on that. Its been too long since then.Engineers were never part of that class. They work for a living while capital owns assets that work for them.Engineers were part of the \"Intellectual Elite\" class that made good money but were super socially progressive. (Think putting BLM signs in their yards while at the same time pricing out the people they claim to help).They ended up becoming a lot of the Elizabeth Warren cohort after being the Hillary and Obama cohorts(before it fractured into part Bernie part MAGA with the rest going to Hillary).Extremely socially progressive but don't you dare touch economics.reply",

      "This is a nice post.  Thanks for sharing it here.  The only thing I would like to add to this fine article is that it is perfectly fine for a personal website to simply be a loose collection of pages arranged in an arbitrary manner.  Not every personal website needs to be a blog.Very often I see aspiring website authors quickly make life complicated for themselves by deciding they need a blog, which then leads to numerous questions about tools and processes that can easily draw anyone into busywork.  That time could otherwise have been spent on actually writing posts, articles, games, demos, etc. for their website that one can look back with joy months or years later.Website busywork is probably fine for people who genuinely want to spend their time thinking about tools and processes.  But if you just want to put your thoughts out there, it can be more fruitful to simply publish HTML, written directly or converted from your favourite text format such Markdown, AsciiDoc, etc.This is a topic I care about quite a bit and my complete thoughts about this would be too long for an HN comment, so I will just share a link to a post I wrote about this recently, in case someone finds value in it: https://susam.net/writing-first-tooling-second.htmlI would genuinely like to see more personal websites, because they make the Web more diverse and more interesting.reply",

      "Scott Adams died today. I want to acknowledge something complicated.He always felt culturally like family to me. His peaks\u2014the biting humor about corporate absurdity, the writing on systems thinking and compounding habits, the clarity about the gap between what organizations say and what they do\u2014unquestionably made me healthier, happier, and wealthier. If you worked in tech in the 90s and 2000s, Dilbert was a shared language for everything broken about corporate life.His views, always unapologetic, became more strident over time and pushed everyone away. That also felt like family.You don\u2019t choose family, and you don\u2019t get to edit out the parts that shaped you before you understood what was happening. The racism and the provocations were always there, maybe, just quieter. The 2023 comments that ended Dilbert\u2019s newspaper run were unambiguous.For Scott, like family, I\u2019m a better person for the contribution. I hope I can represent the good things: the humor, the clarity of thought, the compounding good habits with health and money. I can avoid the ugliness\u2014the racism, the grievance, the need to be right at any cost.Taking inventory is harder than eulogizing or denouncing. But it\u2019s more honest.reply",
      "I think it\u2019s interesting how many responses to this comment seem to have interpreted it fairly differently to my own reading.There are many responding about \u201cignoring racism,\u201d \u201cwhitewashing,\u201d or the importance of calling out bigotry.I\u2019m not sure how that follows from a comment that literally calls out the racism and describes it as \u201cunambiguous.\u201dStriving to \u201cavoid the ugliness\u201d in your own life does not mean ignoring it or refusing to call it out.reply",
      "Ironically, a whole bunch of people have spent their formative years in a cancel-culture world and this now shapes their actions.But at an art gallery, Picasso is near worshipped despite his torrid misogyny and abuse in his personal life which was terrible even by the standards of his day. The views on his art were formed at a time before cancel-culture was a thing.Realising:- everyone has performed good and bad actions- having performed a good action doesn't \"make up for or cancel out\" a bad action. You can save thousands of people, but murdering someone still should mean a life sentence.- you can be appreciated for your good actions while your bad actions still stand.: all these take some life experience and perhaps significant thought on the concepts.reply",
      "First off \"cancel culture\" is way too unserious a phrase to warrant a response, but I will anyway.> The views on his art were formed at a time before cancel-culture was a thing.No they weren't. \"Cancel culture\" (your social actions having social consequences) has and always will exist, but despite your assertion that he was terrible \"even for his day\", I'd bet that a misogynist Frenchman in the early 1900s wasn't going to ruffle that many feathers.John Brown got \"cancelled\" for opposing slavery. Now you can get \"cancelled\" for supporting it. The difference is that now \"cancelled\" means a few commentators call you out and your life and career are never affected in the slightest. It's actually one of the best times to be a horrible person. Hell, you can be president.reply",
      "> The difference is that now \"cancelled\" means a few commentators call you out and your life and career are never affected in the slightest.Weird to read this assertion in a thread about Scott Adams, who literally had his whole career ended. That's literally the opposite of what you said.Also let's remember that he was cancelled for saying that if black people (poll respondents) say \"it's not okay to be white\" that's espousing hate and he wants nothing to do with them.If white people said \"it's not okay to be black,\" that's certainly white supremacy. But the rules are different.reply",
      "It seems that you're not very familiar with what actually happened. The phrase \"It's okay to be white\" had become associated with white supremacists, And black people's responses to the pole had nothing to do with their opinions of white people as a whole. You, as well as Scott Adams, decided to misinterpret it. Scott Adams took things a step further and decided that he wanted nothing to do with black people on the simple basis of this poll, which is absolutely wild.reply",
      "> Weird to read this assertion in a thread about Scott Adams, who literally had his whole career ended. That's literally the opposite of what you said.Nah, he continued to grift off the right wing while saying more and more unhinged shit until he shuffled off this mortal coil.> Also let's remember that he was cancelled for saying that if black people (poll respondents) say \"it's not okay to be white\" that's espousing hate and he wants nothing to do with them.Could it perhaps have anything to do with the fact that that's a 4chan-originated dogwhistle that was hyper-viral at the time? Why do you think they were asking about it in the first place? It was in the context of the fact that the ADL had identified it as secret hate speech, in the same line of the 14 words.> If white people said \"it's not okay to be black,\" that's certainly white supremacy. But the rules are different.The president of the most powerful country on earth and the richest man in the world say things like that all the time. Why the victim complex?reply",
      "> \"Cancel culture\" (your social actions having social consequences)Those aren't the same thing. The former is abusing the latter as a pretext for a (social) lynch mob.> I'd bet that a misogynist Frenchman in the early 1900s wasn't going to ruffle that many feathers.GP wasn't referring to people of the time but rather people of the present day. There have been some surprising contradictions in what has and hasn't been \"cancelled\".reply",
      "Cancel culture is simply social consequence.  That's it.  It can be harsh and at times probably too harsh.  But I don't see how you can't have cancel culture w/o also not greatly limiting free speech.reply",
      "I'm still upset over the canceling of Socrates. Never forget.reply"

      "It's a novelty.  Something more tuned for a scene in a movie than providing security for an individual.But, the way I see it, you have the traditionally \"solved\" state cube on your desk(all faces complete), and when you want to use it as a key you \"solve\" the cube to the state that represents your key.With a rubiks cube this means you only need to remember the steps of the algorithm that leads you to your key state.reply"

    "first_paragraph": "The modern generation of coding agents are powerful in part because of their access permissions. They have a few built-in functions for the most obvious operations (writing files, editing strings) but other than that they mostly generate what they need adhoc. Their bash tool is by far their most powerful because it's the most expressive. You can run some adhoc python to test out some logic, run a compilation pass, or curl a website. It's turning complete for gosh sake.It's also by far the most dangerous. You probably wouldn't give your new intern access to the prod credentials. But an arbitrary bash session could certainly provide that permissions escalation; if not fully delete your home directory from disk.The safest way to run any coding agent is within virtualization. Boot up a container with a limited scope, a git branched workspace of what you're working on, and all the tools it will need to get the job done. I'm willing to wadger a large sum that almost no one does that. --dange"
