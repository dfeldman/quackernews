      "To the people at the top, the job market is a statistic. They can't feel empathy on an issue they're so disconnected from, so they just think it's not their problem, or there isn't much they can do about it. Technological innovation is supposed to mean society can produce more with less work, so in theory everyone's lives could end up better off over time where we could all work less and get more, but in practice, I see more meaningless work created and wealth continues to consolidate at the top.reply",
      "First, I'm sorry you're having problems finding a job -- that sucks.Second: consider that sometimes, the cost-benefit of automation depends on perspective. An example that I like to give is Ocado's automated grocery warehouses in the UK: impressive technology, very efficient, but during the COVID-19 pandemic - when everybody wanted online groceries - Ocado had to stop accepting new customers. They didn't have the capacity, and adding a new warehouse took years. The regular supermarkets hired people and bought vans, they were able to scale up.Automation is great, but it can't help businesses adapt to novel situations. Corporate life is about cycles: the pendulum swings one way, then the other - we've just swung hard over to the automation side for now. The best strategy: know the limits of AI tools, prove your agility and ability to do the things the tools cannot do.reply",
      "The most baffling thing is that even now the H1Bs, etc. are still pouring in. How can you say there is a shortage of IT talent and you need to import them where most grads can't find any work?reply",
      "My company had an onshore hiring freeze, while still hiring offshore. C-suite had the nerve in an all hands to say they were expanding offshore because there was a \"local talent shortage\", all while an onshore hiring freeze was still in effect.This wasn't even a secret; in our stand ups our immediate manager said that they were blocked from hiring onshore and only had offshore quota available if they wanted any more team members.C-suite seem to think they can lie straight to our faces and know they'll get away it.reply",
      "They can. What are you going to do? Quit? That's exactly what they would want. Much cheaper to increase the squeeze than pay redundancies.By the way, it's very similar here in Australia. I don't think there's anything an individual can do in this case. This needs regulation. Even with better workplace protections, the forums are full of people describing what you described and worse.reply",
      "Same thing at my co! The kicker is that our team is down two people with the expectation of increased productivity because of AI. But no filling in those spots, because only offshore, and offshore can't even join our team because of colocation policies.reply",
      "> C-suite seem to think they can lie straight to our faces and know they'll get away it.Hate to say that they're probably right? At least for the moment, tech workers have almost none of the organization or radicalization that would be required to push back against this.reply",
      "If they can get away with it, it\u2019s because they have a product where quality doesn\u2019t matter. If you want to see everything outsourced, \u201c organization or radicalization that would be required to push back against this\u201d seems like the way to go.reply",
      "Because they can't push their finger down a new grads throat if they push back.Someone who's families very presence in this country depends on their employer will rarely find a reason to complain about being overworked to the bone or told to do questionable things.H1B and other programs have a noble purpose that is often (but not always) abused to create loyal servants.reply",
      "The allure for companies of exploiting H1Bs for cheaper and more effective labor I understand. But it is not companies who (at least officially) set the rules and laws regarding immigration.So the questions is why the government is not turning off the outside supply when there is an internal oversupply.reply"

      "Designers of marble fountains who don't use computing to design the paths run into reliability issues: sometimes balls derailing out of their track. They have to observe the contraption, identify problems (balls getting jammed up or jumping out) and then guess at the root causes and make manual adjustments.That's the thing here: he has it running for hours presumably without any ball jumping out.Most of the tracks consist of two rails, so the ball has two contact points. I'm no physicist but it seems like the goal would be to have ideally nearly equal forces at the two contact points at all times during the ball's descent. In other words, the track has to be perfectly banked so that the gravity and centripetal acceleration vector are balanced by a normal vector perpendicular to the rails. During a derailment, the ball has to lift away from one of the two contact points, so the normal force must have dropped to zero.reply",
      "It's actually much weirder than that: banking changes the axis of rotation and thus kills the rotational inertia. The tracks bank super aggressively in order to prevent the ball from accelerating too much and hopping the track. This is part of why the descent is so smooth and all the balls move at more or less the same speed.Also to be fair the final system does lose a ball every 30ish minutes. The tuning was largely me staring at the run or taking a video trying to catch where they get lost. Instead of hand tuning I would just update the generator and print another one. I'm considering closing the loop with a camera but that would be a whole new project.reply",
      "For roller coasters there is a software for simulation. It is imho similar situation compared with balls in your Marble Fountainhttps://www.nolimitscoaster.com/First, I thought about Ansys or CATIA software but I couldn\u2019t find any module specialized for simulation of balls.But I think that people from those companies could help as well and participate in simulation as an interesting usecase. (These software are expensive for personal projects.)reply",
      "Well except for this is SIM only whereas the OP (WillMor) is making them for real with a 3D printer!reply",
      "My point was that these software could help to find weak parts in trajectory - so instead of trying to figure it out by looking where balls are too quick to fall from the ride - you can simulate it. I saw real tramway simulation done in Ansys.reply",
      "I think the physics are different, a ball is basically a car without a differential, so it's going to behave differently on the tracks. I'd imagine the ball is harder to simulate because of that.reply",
      "> That's the thing here: he has it running for hours presumably without any ball jumping out.You can see a ball on the ground at the end of the video :-)reply",
      "This is beautiful.  It would be amazing to have the tracks encode/decode audio, you know?  Like, the track of the marble can be used to generate different frequencies...reply",
      "I actually attempted this, the idea of a python script that converts a midi track into a marble run is just too good to not try. I printed a large drum with different track structures inside so I could test various \"slopes\" by changing the speed and it just doesn't work, the balls bounce around too much to get an audible pitch. A less rigid material or a larger bearing would likely work better but I decided to focus on getting the normal version working well.reply",

      "A multiplayer game prototype, written in Rust, using Bevy + egui for graphics. Think of it as a bare bones implementation of a game like Runescape, mostly to test out current LLM capability.I haven't found much value in LLMs for coding beyond very self contained tasks, but some people speak highly of it, and I want to be sure that I'm not missing out. So from time to time I give new tools a try. This time is \"Claude Code on the web\".I've put in an estimated 50 hours so far. It has a client and an authoritative server. The client displays 3D graphics with some placeholder models. From the client, you can click on tiles and move to them, or click on enemies to pathfind and attack them. You can right-click on tiles or monsters to open a menu with options (attack, trade, move). There are some unit tests and a few integration tests.Right now the issues that Claude has been unable to resolve after a few attempts are:\n* Attack animations. I'm trying to get it to raise and then lower a rectangular block to simulate a sword attack. It really doesn't get it, and it's harder to write tests for compared to movement and server-client networking.\n* \"Entity interpolation\". Rather walking entities instantly moving from tile to tile, movement should flow smoothly.I have Claude Pro ($20/mo) which let me make a few commits per day. After a few days of that, Anthropic offered $250 in credits to promote \"Claude Code on the web\". The credits expire after two weeks. I'm now five days into that period and have gone through $50 in credits. It is heavily rate limited and frequently locks me out for multiple hours after only a few interactions, but it's free credits so I can't really complain.reply",

      "I haven't read the paper, but what I am curious about, how much of the damage can be turned back if someone becomes physically active after a long sedentary period? Let's say someone already had low fat oxidization and/or cardiovascular disease, how much of that can be \"cured\" by being active?This post claims: the good news is, this is reversible. But is that so? Is it also proven to reverse things in all cases? I would imagine there are caveats, and things are not that rosy in reality.The reason I am asking because if the answer is \"None. It can only keep the symptoms from worsening\" then it's not really reasonable to expect people with such physiological situation to become active again.They will most probably need to put in much more effort to achieve much smaller gain compared to a healthy individual, which is as I said is unreasonable. Especially because some people simply have worse genetics and or social circumstances which they might not be able to change.So I appreciate these findings, but how I read this: you need to be aware of this to prevent the ill effects. And I doubt the reversible claim (although I have not much of an argument to corroborate that).reply",

      "This is a bit of history that has always fascinated me ever since I found out in the nineties while employed at Accolade, where we were reverse engineering the Sega Genesis, that the VDP in the Genesis was a variant / descendent of the humble 70's TI TMS9918 (mentioned at the heart of the SG-1000 / Colecovision / MSX and more) - we made a lot of hay in our clean room reverse engineering effort using Texas Instruments data sheets for the 9918!It is also casually mentioned that the TMS9918 inspired the VDP in the Famicom/NES but I haven't seen any direct proof because it also seems possible that the 2A03 was derived from Nintendo/Ikegami Tsushinki  'Namco Galaxian' inspired arcade board design notably used in Donkey Kong.  It's an interesting thread and perhaps studying Galaxian arcade hardware and Donkey Kong hardware and contrasting it with the TMS9918 and 2A03 can establish some geneology for home and arcade VDP design in the early 80'sBut it is clear that there was a pretty 'open source' attitude towards hardware IP at SEGA and Nintendo and elswhere in the early 80s.reply",

      "I\u2019m delighted to see this project evolving and look forward to following its development! I\u2019ve used just about every markup technology over my (many) years as a tech writer, from troff macros, to SGML/DocBook and then XML/DITA, and finally, to Markup with the Material for MkDocs project, as a sponsor. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but for enabling contributors outside the tech writing community, simpler source formats are the way.That said, if pressed, I\u2019d recommend AsciiDoc[0] over any Markup flavor for a greenfield project _today_. We had to either add or bake plugins or extensions to get features that are already included in AsciiDoc, making our Markup implementation both more complex and wholly unique. That wasn\u2019t a huge problem, because we didn\u2019t have a large pool of contributors to educate and support, but it would have been much easier just to point to a standard.But, hey! The roadmap includes modules, to make way for other source formats! This is the way. :-)[0] https://asciidoc.org/EDIT: s/That's the way/This is the way. :-)/reply",
      "It is a very reasonable choice: your plug-in project has grown to a scale you have never anticipated. Therefore, you built your own system from the ground up, one which you have total control over, instead of keeping to rely on someone else's system as you did before. This would make new features and bug fixes more easy to be implemented.I am also very curious about what the MKDocs future would be like. Material has been the most popular theme for MkDocs. People are not using it because they have chosen MkDocs, but using MkDocs because they have chosen Material. With Zensical promising (some kind of) MkDocs compatibility, there will be fewer reasons to stay on MkDocs instead of migrating to the new project.reply",

This would make new features and bug fixes more easy to be implemented.Exactly this. We ran against walls trying to realize our ideas with MkDocs' APIs, so a rewrite was due. With MkDocs being unmaintained for over a year, we took the initiative. Since we have excellent product-market fit, investing into a new stack was just logical.reply",

      "I'm really excited by this development! Material for MkDocs has raised the quality level of so many projects' docs, my own included, by making good navigation the default. It's by far my favorite system to browse as a reader, and use as a project maintainer.I hope the new theme allows for more customization than the old Material theme. It was really hard to create a unique brand identity within the constraints of Material; it just wasn't built with customization in mind beyond a color. The \"modern\" theme looks minimal in a way that gives me some hope for this.Looking forward to kicking the tires on Zensical!reply",
      "I'm really intrigued by the use of differential dataflow in a static site toolkit, but there isn't much in the way written about it. If anyone from the team are here I would love it if you could explain how it's being used? Does this enable fast incremental builds, only changing the parts that change in the input? If so how do you model that? Are you using multisets as a message format inside the engine?For context, I work on TanStack DB which is a differential dataflow / DBSP inspired reactive client datastore. Super interested in your use case.reply",
      "Excellent question. We're not using differential dataflow (DD), but are rolling our own differential runtime. It's basically functions stitched together with operators, heavily inspired by DD and RxJS, and is optimized for performance and ease of use. The decision to go from scratch allows us to provide something that, IMHO, is much simpler to work with than DD and Rx, as our goal is to allow an ecosystem to evolve, as MkDocs did as well. For this, the API needs to be as simple as possible, while ensuring DD semantics.Right now, builds are not fast, since Python Markdown is our bottleneck. We decided to go this route to offer the best compatibility possible with the Material for MkDocs ecosystem, so users can switch easily. In the next 12 months, we'll be working on moving the rest of the code base gradually to Rust and entirely detaching from Python, which will make builds significantly faster. Rebuilds are already fast, due to the (still preliminary) caching we employ.The differential runtime is called ZRX[1], which forms the foundation of Zensical.[1]: https://github.com/zensical/zrxreply",
      "I was excited up until they showed what the new theme looks like. mkdocs-Material was nice in that it didn't have overly rounded corners and over travesties, a shame that custom CSS will be needed to undo the \"modernisation\". Overall this seems very interesting, especially the performance improvements, just a letdown visually.reply",
      "Creator of Zensical here! As always, it's a matter of taste. We felt the original look was a little date. You can use the classic Material for MkDocs look with Zensical by adding a single line of configuration[1]. This works because the HTML is exactly the same right now.

Our goal is to support docs-as-code workflows with tens of thousands of pages, without compromising performance or usability.To make the transition seamless, compatibility comes first. We're putting significant effort into ensuring a smooth migration from Material for MkDocs for all users. Zensical can natively read mkdocs.yml, allowing you to build your existing project with minimal changes. As of now, a subset of plugins is supported, and we're working on feature parity "
