      "Interesting project. I'm curious about the limits of formal verification of worst case execution time. There are other formally verified kernels like seL4 and atmosphere, as well as layers you can stack on top to get a mostly compatible posix-ish layer like genode. You can also go out and find completely compatible kernels with enough maturity that (full) formal verification isn't a major value-add, like QNX or VxWorks.I'm not aware of much that combines WCET + formal verification + POSIX compatibility though. The verification page here is mostly at stone level, which from my understanding of SPARK terminology just means it passes validation, but might have runtime errors where most of Ada's WCET nondeterminism comes from. I'm skeptical that this is actually production usable for the hard real-time use cases all over their documentation at the current stage, but nothing on the website gives any clue as to the actual maturity short of reading the code myself.reply",
      "Any government can get RCE on any OS with the change in their couch.  Formal verification of process isolation is REALLY important when lives depend on it.  That's a huge value add!My main concern is speed and the lack of capability based security.  seL4 is faster than Linux by a mile and I'm guessing that this is much slower.  You can put a POSIX layer on seL4 but POSIX is inherently flawed too.  MAC separates privileges from code and is too clunky to use in practice (see seLinux).reply",

      "It looks interesting and in a past life I probably would have tried it out but do you know why I like React? Because it's just JavaScript.This `<let/variable=...>` and `<for ...>` syntax is awful.reply",
      "I mostly agree with you but React isn\u2019t just JavaScript. JSX is not JavaScript. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re so used to it we don\u2019t consider it notable any more. Worth keeping in mind when you\u2019re looking at a brand new framework.reply",

It\u2019s HTML, and anything between { and } is evaluated as JavaScript.2) Inserting a React component\u2019s \u201cHTML tag\u201d in your JSX is _actually_ the same as calling the JavaScript function. The HTML attributes are the function arguments. Yes, inside your function there can be state, and there can be contexts, and there are refs. But you get at all of those things by calling JavaScript functions.Like,      <b><MyComponent attr=\u201cyes\u201d /></b>\n\nis literally identical to:      <b>{MyComponent({ attr: \u201cyes\u201d })}</b>\n\nIt\u2019s the tiniest bit of syntactic sugar.I feel like too many people think \u201cReact is Just JavaScript\u201d is some kind of lie people tell to make React sound cool.It\u2019s not a lie. There\u2019s a _small_ amount of hand waving around the word \u201cjust\u201d but the point is, it\u2019s WAY smaller than what you need to explain the ways Svelte or Vue or Angular diverge from plain JavaScript.reply",
      "> JSX, more than any other templating system, is just HTML interleaved with JavaScript. It\u2019s HTML, and anything between { and } is evaluated as JavaScript.That\u2019s not true though and IMO is one of the weaknesses of JSX: it looks like something it is not. Having to use className instead of class is one of the most obvious tells. But in theory if it was just HTML with {}s I should be able to do:- `<{tagName} />`\n- `<span {someTextContent} />and many other things I\u2019m actually not able to do.",
      "I don't think the syntactic sugar works how you describe. JSX components actually desugar to something like:   <b>{jsx(MyComponent, { attr: \"yes\" })</b>\n\n(Previously this function was called \"React.createElement\",  but these days they have special functions that only the JSX compiler is allowed to use.) The extra layer of indirection is needed to do things like support hooks being called inside of MyComponent's function body, keep track of `key` props, and so on.reply",
      "And this is one of the disadvantages of JSX. The snippets you posted are NOT identical.JSX (react flavor) is lazy. <My component> is not rendered/evaluated until it's needed.You can't just call a react component. It's not a regular function call.reply",
      "It's further than that even. JSX has the semantics of (modulo a couple of optimisations there and there) a bunch of nested function calls returning normal JavaScript objects. That means you can, in your head, very easily convert between the JSX representation of an expression and the equivalent transpiled JavaScript code.This is unlike a lot of other templating languages where, even if the expression part of the language is pure JavaScript (or PHP or Python or whatever), it's still interleaved with arbitrary text which will get printed out according to its own rules. This makes the whole thing much harder to reason about (leading to the philosophy that you should put as little logic as possible in your templates because it makes them harder to understand, _even when that logic is directly related to the templating process_.A good example is for-loops. In a lot of templating languages, you start in text-land, then you enter expression-land to write the opening {% for (const X of ...) %} line, then you're back in text-land again. You sprinkle in a couple of expressions, and then at the end you go back to expression-land to close the loop. You're jumping backwards and forwards between the two worlds, but there's no real syntactical or structural support for mixing them.Meanwhile, in JSX, you start in text-land, then you open up an expression between two curly braces, and in that expression you write the entirety of your loop. If you need to go back to text-land within that loop, you can create a _new_ set of text nodes, but you're not interleaving expressions and text in the same way.The result of this is that, once you understand how your JSX will get compiled, it's very easy to read it as if it were the JavaScript that it will get compiled to, rather than as a separate templating language. Which in turn makes it very easy to think of it as \"just JavaScript\", even if it's technically a syntax extension.reply",
      "It\u2019s not JavaScript if you can\u2019t make an html page locally and open it in your browser without things like an http server or need to transpile.reply",
      "There are a lot of things people might mean by claiming that something \"is just JavaScript,\" but one possible meaning is that the source code you write can run in the browser without any build whatsoever. For React, that's true with the exception of JSX, which is a very simple and optional syntax transform. (Of course in practice you'll probably want to do module bundling too, but browsers could technically load your ES modules directly from static file storage.For Marko, that doesn't seem to be the case, but it also doesn't really make sense given the problems that Marko is trying to solve.Another thing people might mean by \"it's just JavaScript\" is a much more subjective notion about how similar the overal syntax, control flow, etc. feels to whatever previous JavaScript experience the person has. This meaning is a lot harder to pin down, and in most cases reasonable people could disagree on what is and isn't \"just JavaScript\" according to this meaning. That said, I would tend to agree that React's templating uses normal JavaScript control flow and composition primitives more so than Marko.reply",
      "That's true, sure. My response to that is in React you have JavaScript & JSX and there are clear boundaries. It's not mixed.

      "I love that they're trying this. It appears the more practical goal might be retrofitting existing vessels with large sails to augment the motors, but making a point with a fully wind-powered vessel is a good show. Well, it would have been fully wind powered if not for the damaged sail. Good on them for sticking with the journey, though. I hope they keep running the vessel and get a few more fully wind powered journeys.reply",
      "I have a dim recollection of exactly this as a VC proposal likely put to YC in the past 24 months or so.I think the notion was to fit masts to existing container ship and stacks, and I gsve it scant attention as my intuition (I once studied actual civil/mech engineering prior to jumping ship for applied math) suggested masts are better as integral parts of ships rather than bolt on after thoughts.EDIT: Wingsails to reduce cargo ship fuel consumption (April 2023)https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35426482  I\u2019m Joseph, and along with Arpan and Bailey we are the founders of OutSail Shipping. We\u2019re building a sail the size of a 747 that rolls up into a shipping container.\n\nhttps://outsailshipping.com/ https://www.linkedin.com/company/OutSail-Shipping/  When deployed, it will generate thrust from the wind to reduce the fuel consumption of a cargo ship. An array of these devices will reduce fuel consumption on ships by up to 20%. These sails are easily stowed and removed to cause no interference with cargo operations.\n\n  Here\u2019s a short video showing our prototype:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUpVqzpym54Not quite as I remembered .. kite sails, et al. are a good idea, I'm still a bit torn by the physics of a container deployed boom extension sail and the thrust transmission to the ship. Still, I haven't modeled it, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt.EDIT2: Both links appear dead, so I guess that was a swing and a miss.

      "\"suggested masts are better as integral parts of ships rather than bolt on after thoughts.\"It seems quite mad that we even need to debate this.  Wind is free power and we have at least 2000 years of engineering to draw on how to use it.Any propulsion unit needs to be effectively attached to a ship.  Screws are attached longitudinally, low down and push.  Sails are a bit more tricksy.  A triangular sail mounted along the long axis will generally work best because it can handle more wind angles but a square sail mounted across the long axis will provide more power on a \"reach\" to a \"run\" (the wind is mostly from behind, so pushing).The cutting edge of sailing ships that carried stuff are the tea clippers.  Think \"Cutty Sark\" which is now a visitor attraction in London, Greenwich.  Note the stay sails - the triangular sails at the front.  Then note the three masts.  Each mast has several main sails that are huge rectangles for \"reaches\" and additional extensions.  There are even more triangular infill sails above the main sails.It's quite hard to explain how wind and sails work but you need to understand that a sailing ship can sail \"into the wind\".  Those triangles are better at it than those rectangles but those rectangles can get more power by being bigger.  Even better, you can use the front triangular sails (stay sails) to moderate the wind to feed the other sails with less turbulent wind.Wind is free power and it is so well understood.  How on earth is this news?reply",
      "This is an area I have some peripheral involvement with. For retrofitted sails on bulkers, the figure of 10% saving in fuel is the usual one mentioned rather than 20%. However given the long life of ships, there is much more interest in retrofit than in new build.You mention container ships. I haven't seen anything explicit on these, and I think the reason is probably that they cruise much faster than bulkers and tankers, which means the potential savings from sail is smaller. I would have thought 20% optimistic even for a new-build.reply",
      "Retro fit is clearly a preferred path for a new approach given ship life spans and size of existing global transport fleet.My gut objection to the container approach taken above in the first link was existing container locking mechanisms for ships can struggle in severe weather to keep the boxes on the boat .. additional forces from a sail (in good weather) might well mimic the forces that break stacks in bad weather.Your point is well taken, I might suggest that container ships could be segregated into fast and slow cargo and that might help somewhat with total fleet fuel consumption. (pure spitball notion).reply",
      "Wasn't the main issue with this that fuel is paid for by cargo ship customers (the container owners), not the shipping company? So the shipping company doesn't want to spend a ton of capital to get a 10% discount to all their customers, and there was no way for thousands of random customers to exert pressure on the shipping company to do so. Basically the economics didn't make sense.reply",

It's simplified and has just enough presence to properly host graphical applications. No taskbar, no notifications (or associated drawer), no self-populated launcher menu. File manager is spatial so it doesn't need a sidebar or navigation chrome. Multitasking is technically possible, but high-friction since the only way to switch between running apps is the little app switcher menu in the top right corner and becomes more cumbersome the more apps/windows you open. Included browser does not support tabs, only windows. Shortcuts to frequently used apps must be added intentionally (to your desktop as aliases/shortcuts or to the launcher menu).This design strongly encourages singular focus without forcing it.

If this mode were light enough, it could boot up in the same amount of time as a normal digital camera, allowing your the phone to be truly off while you're not taking pictures. I do often take a digital camera with me, but sometimes I don't want the bulk or maybe I didn't initially plan to take a lot of pictures.reply",

Starting with the \u201cgoto\u201d jumps of early programming languages and the emergence of structured programming in the 1960s, the book explores advanced control structures for imperative languages such as generators and coroutines, then develops alternate views of control in functional languages, first as continuations and their control operators, then as algebraic effects and effect handlers.  Blending history, code examples, and theory, the book offers an original, comparative perspective on programming languages, as well as an extensive introduction to algebraic effects and other contemporary research topics in P.L.To be published by Cambridge University Press.This is an HTML preview of the book, generated with Hevea.

This led me to buy a BeagleBoard so I could verify the omap-serial bug on hardware.After I figured out the bug with the UART driver, I realized that the OMAP3530 has support for booting from USB, so I decided to go off on a random tangent to get USB boot working. There was no problem I was trying to solve or anything like that. I just thought it would be a fun experiment (am I a masochist?). Little did I know, I would be getting myself into some tricky USB packet analysis.I struggled to find info about this process because of how old the OMAP is today.

So we took a LoRa board to a hotel building 2 city blocks away from our lab and cranked the coding gain up to the max, which gave us about a 1 byte payload every second.

      "Working at a company that uses react-native I wish nothing more than for the end of app stores and differing platform languages.We're heavily considering just having a website next year with a mobile app using webview, and then native code for the native notifications, GPS and healthkit / health connect.I feel like AI is changing the equation, its nearly better to write your business UI 3 times one for each platform.reply",
      "I did this and never looked back.It\u2019s called a \u201cWebView app\u201d and you can get a really good experience on all platforms using them. Just:- don\u2019t make any crazy decisions on your fundamental UI components, like breadcrumbs, select dropdowns, etc- add a few platform-specific specialisations to those same components, to make them feel a bit more familiar, such as button styling, or using a self-simplifying back-stack on Android- test to make sure your webview matches the native browser\u2019s behaviour where it matters. For example, sliding up the view when the keyboard is opened on mobile, navigating back & forth with edge-swipes on iOS, etcI also went the extra step and got service workers working, for a basic offline experience, and added a native auto network diagnostic tool that runs on app startup and checks \u201cCan reach local network\u201d \u201cCan reach internet (1.1.1.1)\u201d \u201cCan resolve our app\u2019s domain\u201d etc etc, so users can share where it failed to get quicker support. But this is an app for small-to-medium businesses, not consumer-facing, and the HTML5 part is served from the server and cached. I haven\u2019t thought much about what you might need to do additionally for a consumer app, or a local-first app.reply",
      "I have never once experienced a WebView app that I would say had \u201ca really good experience.\u201dreply",
      "It\u2019s because if a webview app experience is good, you don\u2019t notice it, you only notice if it\u2019s bad.A while ago saw a blog link on HN that explained how Apple uses it everywhere and we never notice it because they are done well. Of course I can\u2019t find that link now, I summon the HN gods\u2026reply",
      "Maybe this https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/inspecting-web-views-in-ma... and https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30648424?On mobile the webview app experience is crap and it's immediately obvious that an app is not native. Simply nobody asks customers how they like it. The management assumes that as long as nobody complains and the users don't leave in droves, the experience must be impeccable.reply",
      "It's often easy to tell, but my concern has shifted from \"Why isn't this native? It's ugly/slow\" to \"Why isn't this a goddamn webpage? It can't justify neither its permissions nor its space\".reply",
      "It is immediately obvious when you are using a web view app, as it uses browser layout and non-native controls. And  I have never found one to be as intuitive or nice an experience as native controls.reply",
      "> It\u2019s because if a webview app experience is good, you don\u2019t notice it, you only notice if it\u2019s bad.Aside from Apple\u2019s apps (which imo are noticeably worse than the old ones, but that\u2019s beside the point), what are some good WebView apps on iOS right now?reply",
      "Somebody scraped the play store and checked the framework, so a list for Android WebView apps, built with capacitor, is here: https://capgo.app/top_capacitor_app/ Maybe an equivalent is there on iOS for the same app...reply",
      "lichess is really good. Thanks for the info, I'm not surprised to learn it's a webview app, but it is really good.It doesn't look native but who even cares. I think when a UI sucks or is unintuitive or buggy then \"it's not native\" is a sort of catchall easy complaint. Native is a crutch. Sometimes it's a good crutch (accessibility etc). But that's more about developer efficiency and bare minimums of polish.reply"

      "Besides this first report (AIM-001), some of the reports following it in the next months are at least as important, by introducing other essential features of LISP and of many later languages:1958-10: AIM-003 (the special form \"maplist\", i.e. a kind of \"forall\" iteration)1958-10: AIM-004 (anonymous function definitions using \"lambda\"; the special form \"select\", which already at that early date had better syntax and semantics than the \"switch\" or \"case\" statements of later languages; the special form \"search\")1959-03-13: AIM-008 (the special form \"quote\"; the special form \"label\", for defining anonymous recursive functions; also the special forms \"and\" and \"or\", a.k.a.

      "Reposting my now very old comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10502434 :> Herbert Stoyan's historical work on early Lisp http://www.mcjones.org/dustydecks/archives/2010/07/29/185/ https://web.archive.org/web/20050617031004/http://www8.infor... is probably worth reading if one is seriously interested. (I haven't read much of it myself yet.) McCarthy praised Stoyan's work as better than his own 1979 HOPL paper ( http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/lisp.html ): \"Stoyan's reading of the early LISP documents gives a more accurate picture than my own memories turned out to have given.\" http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/> (As a side-note, I'm pretty sure that the broken, Wayback-beating link to \"Lisp references according to Miller\" on McCarthy's page is to this http://www.ai.sri.com/~delacaze/alu-site/alu/table/Lisp-Hist... document by Kent Pitman and Brad Miller (see http://www.ai.sri.com/~delacaze/alu-site/alu/table/history.h... ).)From 2015-2018, \"The Mysteries of Lisp -- I: The Way to S-expression Lisp\" by Hong-Yi Dai https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07375 ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31153702 )>     Despite its old age, Lisp remains mysterious to many of its admirers. The mysteries on one hand fascinate the language, on the other hand also obscure it. Following Stoyan but paying attention to what he has neglected or omitted, in this first essay of a series intended to unravel these mysteries, we trace the development of Lisp back to its origin, revealing how the language has evolved into its nowadays look and feel. The insights thus gained will not only enhance existent understanding of the language but also inspires further improvement of it.reply",
