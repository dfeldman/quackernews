It may become harder for the user to see clearly, whether from external glare or from internal reflections in a dark room.

The problem is that you don\u2019t know if and when there might be a correction.

I honestly don\u2019t know but intuitively I would say that it is possible that they do not.I think a potentially better way would be to segment the market up to today but take half or 10% of all the stocks and make only those available to the LLM. Then run the test on the rest. This accounts for rules and external forces changing how markets operate over time. And you can do this over and over picking a different 10% market slice for training data each time.But then your problem is that if you exclude let\u2019s say Intel from your training data and AMD from your testing data then there ups and downs don\u2019t really make sense since they are direct competitors.

      "Grok would likely have an advantage there, as well - it's got better coupling to X/Twitter, a better web search index, fewer safety guardrails in pretraining and system prompt modification that distort reality. It's easy to envision random market realities that would trigger ChatGPT or Claude into adjusting the output to be more politically correct. DeepSeek would be subject to the most pretraining distortion, but have the least distortion in practice if a random neutral host were selected.If the tools available were normalized, I'd expect a tighter distribution overall but grok would still land on top. Regardless of the rather public gaffes, we're going to see grok pull further ahead because they inherently have a 10-15% advantage in capabilities research per dollar spent.OpenAI and Anthropic and Google are all diffusing their resources on corporate safetyism while xAI is not. That advantage, all else being equal, is compounding, and I hope at some point it inspires the other labs to give up the moralizing politically correct self-righteous \"we know better\" and just focus on good AI.I would love to see a frontier lab swarm approach, though. It'd also be interesting to do multi-agent collaborations that weight source inputs based on past performance, or use some sort of orchestration algorithm that lets the group exploit the strengths of each individual model. Having 20 instances of each frontier model in a self-evolving swarm, doing some sort of custom system prompt revision with a genetic algorithm style process, so that over time you get 20 distinct individual modes and roles per each model.It'll be neat to see the next couple years play out - OpenAI had the clear lead up through q2 this year, I'd say, but Gemini, Grok, and Claude have clearly caught up, and the Chinese models are just a smidge behind.

      "Random nerd note: The history is slightly wrong. Netscape had their own \"interactive script\" language at the time Sun started talking about Java and somehow got the front page of the Mercury news when they announced it in March of 1995. At the Third International World Wide Web Conference in Darmstadt Germany everyone was talking about it and I was roped into giving a session on it during lunch break (which then had to be stopped because no one was going to the keynote by SGI :-)). Everyone one there was excited and saying \"forget everything, this is the future.\" So, Netscape wanted to incorporate it into Netscape Navigator (their browser) but they had a small problem which was that this was kind of a competitor to their own scripting language. They wanted to call it JavaScript to ride the coattails of the Java excitement and Sun legal only agreed to let them do that if they would promise to ship Java in their browser when it hit 1.0 (which it did in September of that year).So Netscape got visibility for their language, Sun got the #1 browser to ship their language and they had leverage over Microsoft to extortionately license it for Internet Explorer. There were debates among the Java team about whether or not this was a \"good\" thing or not, I mean for Sun sure, but the confusion between what was \"Java\" was not. The politics won of course, and when they refused to let the standards organization use the name \"JavaScript\" the term ECMAScript was created.So there's that.

      "> In Rust, creating a mutable global variable is so hard that there are long forum discussions on how to do it. In Zig, you can just create one, no problem.Well, no, creating a mutable global variable is trivial in Rust, it just requires either `unsafe` or using a smart pointer that provides synchronization. That's because Rust programs are re-entrant by default, because Rust provides compile-time thread-safety. If you don't care about statically-enforced thread-safety, then it's as easy in Rust as it is in Zig or C. The difference is that, unlike Zig or C, Rust gives you the tools to enforce more guarantees about your code's possible runtime behavior.reply",
      "> [...] is trivial in Rust [...] it just requires [...]This is a tombstone-quality statement.  It's the same framing people tossed around about C++ and Perl and Haskell (also Prolog back in the day).  And it's true, insofar as it goes.  But languages where \"trivial\" things \"just require\" rapidly become \"not so trivial\" in the aggregate.  And Rust has jumped that particular shark.  It will never be trivial, period.reply",
      "so does the rust compiler check for race conditions between threads at compile time? if so then i can see the allure of rust over c, some of those sync issues are devilish. and what about situations where you might have two variables closely related that need to be locked as a pair whenever accessed.reply",
      "> so does the rust compiler check for race conditions between threads at compile time?My understanding is that Rust prevents data races, but not all race conditions.\nYou can still get a logical race where operations interleave in unexpected ways. Rust can\u2019t detect that, because it\u2019s not a memory-safety issue.So you can still get deadlocks, starvation, lost wakeups, ordering bugs, etc., but Rust gives you:- No data races- No unsynchronized aliasing of mutable data- Thread safety enforced through type system (Send/Sync)reply",
      "and you can have good races too (where the order doesnt matter)reply",
      "> what about situations where you might have two variables closely related that need to be locked as a pair whenever accessed.This fits quite naturally in Rust. You can let your mutex own the pair: locking a `Mutex<(u32, u32)>` gives you a guard that lets you access both elements of the pair. Very often this will be a named `Mutex<MyStruct>` instead, but a tuple works just as well.reply",

      "In rust, there are two kinds of references, exclusive (&mut) and shared(&). Rustc guarantees you that if you provide an exclusive reference, no other thread will have that. If your thread has an exclusive reference, then it can mutate the contents of the memory. Rustc also guarantees that you won't end up with a dropped reference inside of your threads, so you will always have allocated memory.Because rust guarantees you won't have multiple exclusive (and thus mutable refs), you won't have a specific class of race conditions.Sometimes however, these programs are very strict, and you need to relax these guarantees. To handle those cases, there are structures that can give you the same shared/exclusive references and borrowing rules (ie single exclusive, many shared refs) but at runtime. Meaning that you have an object, which you can reference (borrow) in multiple locations, however, if you have an active shared reference, you can't get an exclusive reference as the program will (by design) panic, and if you have an active exclusive reference, you can't get any more references.This however isn't sufficient for multithreaded applications. That is sufficient when you have lots of pieces of memory referencing the same object in a single thread. For multi-threaded programs, we have RwLocks.https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/index.htmlreply",

      "Regarding Stanford specifically, I did not see the number broken down by academic or residential disability (in the underlying Atlantic article). This is relevant, because> Some students get approved for housing accommodations, including single rooms and emotional-support animals.buries the lede, at least for Stanford. It is incredibly commonplace for students to \"get an OAE\" (Office of Accessible Education) exclusively to get a single room. Moreover, residential accommodations allow you to be placed in housing prior to the general population and thus grant larger (& better) housing selection.I would not be surprised if a majority of the cited Stanford accommodations were not used for test taking but instead used exclusively for housing (there are different processes internally for each).edit: there is even a practice of \"stacking\" where certain disabilities are used to strategically reduce the subset of dorms in which you can live, to the point where the only intersection between your requirements is a comfy single, forcing Admin to put you there. It is well known, for example, that a particularly popular dorm is the nearest to the campus clinic. If you can get an accommodation requiring proximity to the clinic, you have narrowed your choices to that dorm or another. One more accommodation and you are guaranteed the good dorm.reply",
      "The original article which is linked in this post goes into much better detail: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/01/elite-universit...Schools and universities have made accommodations a priority for decades. It started with good intentions, but parents and students alike have noticed that it's both a) easy to qualify for a disability and b) provides significant academic advantages if you do.Another big accommodation request is extra time on tests. At many high schools and universities, getting more time than your peers to take tests is as simple as finding a doctor who will write the write things in a note for you. Some universities grant special permissions to record lectures to students with disabilities, too.If you don't have a disability, you aren't allowed to record lectures and you have to put your pencil down at the end of the normal test window. As you can imagine, when a high percentage of the student body gets to stay longer for a hard test, the wheels start turning in students' heads as they realize cheating is being normalized and they're being left behind by not getting that doctors' note.The rampant abuse is really becoming a problem for students with true disabilities. As you can imagine, when the disability system is faced with 1/3 of the student body registering for disability status the limited number of single rooms and other resources will inevitably get assigned to people who don't need it while some who actually do need it are forced to go without.reply",
      "In a high stakes, challenging environment, every human weakness possible becomes a huge, career impeding liability. Very few people are truly all-around talented. If you are a Stanford level scientist, it doesn't take a lot of anxiety to make it difficult to compete with other Stanford level scientists who don't have any anxiety. Without accommodations, you could still be a very successful scientist after going to a slightly less competitive university.Rising disability rates are not limited to the Ivy League.A close friend of mine is faculty at a medium sized university and specializes in disability accommodations. She is also deaf. Despite being very bright and articulate, she had a tough time in university, especially lecture-heavy undergrad. In my eyes, most of the students she deals with are \"young and disorganized\" rather than crippled. Their experience of university is wildly different from hers. Being diagnosed doesn't immediately mean you should be accommodated.The majority of student cases receive extra time on exams and/or attendance exemptions. But the sheer volume of these cases take away a lot of badly needed time and funding for students who are talented, but are also blind or wheelchair bound. Accommodating this can require many months of planning to arrange appropriate lab materials, electronic equipment, or textbooks.As the article mentions, a deeply distorted idea of normal is being advanced by the DSM (changing ADHD criteria) as well as social media (enjoying doodling, wearing headphones a lot, putting water on the toothbrush before toothpaste. These and many other everyday things are suggested signs of ADHD/autism/OCD/whatever). This is a huge problem of its own. Though it is closely related to over-prescribing education accommodations, it is still distinct.Unfortunately, psychological-education assessments are not particularly sensitive. They aren't good at catching pretenders and cannot distinguish between a 19 year old who genuinely cannot develop time management skills despite years of effort & support, and one who is still developing them fully. Especially after moving out and moving to a new area with new (sub)cultures.Occasionally, she sees documents saying \"achievement is consistent with intelligence\", a polite way of saying that a student isn't very smart, and poor grades are not related to any recognized learning disability. Really and truly, not everyone needs to get an undergrad degree.reply",
      "> Being diagnosed doesn't immediately mean you should be accommodated.This is the loophole. Universities aren't the ones diagnosing, they're the ones accommodating.The current meta-game is for parents and students to share notes about which doctors will diagnose easily. Between word of mouth and searches on Reddit, it's not that hard to find doctors in any metro area who will provide diagnoses and accommodation request letters to anyone who makes an appointment and asks nicely.There are now also online telehealth services that don't hide the fact that this is one of their services. You pay their (cash only, please) fee and they'll make sure you get your letter. The same thing is happening with \"emotional support animal\" letters.Once it becomes widely known that getting a diagnosis is the meta-game to getting housing priority, nicer rooms, extra time on tests, and other benefits the numbers climb rapidly. When the number is approaching 38%, the system has become broken.It's a real problem for the students who really need these accommodations. When 38% of the students qualify for \"priority\" housing, you're still in competition with 1/3 of the student body for those limited resources.reply",

      "Now I've been dabbling outside of Django, I realised some of those things come from bits people don't think about much:INSTALLED_APPS and other bits in the settings provide a central registration point, from there the system where a project is made up of apps is enabled.Each app, has it's own migrations, models, templates and static files.This enables the whole ecosystem of parts that's easy to add, and makes it easy to toggle things (e.g. enabling the django-debug-toolbar only on your dev and local instance).In the outside world of Flask, Fast API etc - things hang together much more loosely and it means the integration just isn't as complete.This manifests itself in 1,000 little papercuts that make things take longer.reply",
      "It can be similar to WordPress plugins, but as problematic as WordPress plugins are, they went a lot farther in terms of ecosystem. While stored in the database, the WordPress plugins do the equivalent of INSTALLED_APPS, calling the code to register them.Someone tried to make an ecosystem of Django apps, called Pinax, and it was pretty nice, but didn't pick up that much market share.reply",

      "An essay by Converse in this volumehttps://www.amazon.com/Ideology-Discontent-Clifford-Geertz/d... [1]calls into question whether or not the public has an opinion.  I was thinking about the example of tariffs for instance.  Most people are going on bellyfeel so you see maybe 38% are net positive on tariffshttps://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/08/14/trumps-tarif...If you broke it down in terms of interest groups on a \"one dollar one vote\" basis the net positive has to be a lot worse:  to the retail, services and constructor sectors tariffs are just a cost without any benefits,  even most manufacturers are on the fence because they import intermediate goods and want access to foreign markets.  The only sectors that are strongly for it that I can suss out are steel and aluminum manufacturers who are 2% or so of the GDP.The public and the interest groups are on the same side of 50% so there is no contradiction,  but in this particular case I think the interest groups collectively have a more rational understanding of how tariffs effect the economy than do \"the people\".  As Habermas points out,  it's quite problematic giving people who don't really know a lot a say about things even though it is absolutely necessary that people feel heard.[1] Interestingly this book came out in 1964 just before all hell broke loose in terms of Vietnam, counterculture, black nationalism, etc. -- right when discontent when from hypothetical to very realreply",
      "People that favor tariffs, want to bring manufacturing capabilities back to the US, in the hopes of creating jobs, and increasing national security by minimizing dependence on foreign governments for critical capabilities.  This is legitimate cost benefit analysis not bellyfeel.  People are aware of the increased cost associated with it.reply",
      "Tariffs don't do this, though. If you want to do this, you just have to pass laws saying companies are required to manufacture x% of their goods domestically. Putting tariffs in place with no other controls will just see companies shift costs downstream, which is exactly what is happening.Companies employ economists, lawyers, and legislators, all to ensure they can find workarounds for anything they don't like that's not 100% forced on them by a law (and will even flout the law if the cost/benefit works out).All evidence is that tariffs have actually tanked jobs, precisely because companies are assuming a defensive fiscal posture in response to what they view as a hostile fiscal policy.reply",
      "An aside on tariffs, it\u2019s a tax (either literally depending on the upcoming SCOTUS ruling, or if not in name then in whatever language SCOTUS decides to call an additional fee consumers pay when buying goods. But a tax either way).Relevant to the post, when supporters believe that \u201cforeigners are swallowing 100% of the cost of the tariffs\u201d they cheer them on. Those same supporters when they\u2019re told the truth that consumers do end up with inflated prices because of them? Their support plummets.reply",
      "They have a vague notion of wanting the quality of life back like they had In the past, everything else goes completely over their headsreply",
      ">want\n>in the hopes ofBut these are still bellyfeel words. What does more rigorous analysis of tariffs say about these things? Do they bring manufacturing back? Do they create jobs?reply",
      "Should the US adopt the European model? Open an inquiry to explore an investigation that could become en exploratory committee? Sounds like a bad idea.reply",
      "Even ardent protectionists generally agree that tariffs can't bring jobs and manufacturing back by themselves. To work, they have to be accompanied by programs to nurture dead or failing domestic industries and rebuild them into something functional. Without that, you get results like the current state of US shipbuilding: pathetic, dysfunctional, and benefiting no one at all. Since there are no such programs, tariffs remain a cost with no benefit.reply",
      "Also, there is a massive conflict of interest associated with trusting the opinions of companies actively engaged in labor and environmental arbitrage. Opinions of politicians and think-tanks downstream of them in terms of funding, too. Even if those opinions are legitimately more educated and better reasoned, they are on the opposite side of the bargaining table from most people and paying attention to them alone is \"who needs defense attorneys when we have prosecutors\" level of madness.If anyone is looking for an expert opinion that breaks with the \"free trade is good for everyone all of the time lah dee dah\" consensus, Trade Wars are Class Wars by Klein & Pettis is a good read.reply",
      "So if X% of the economy benefits directly you might say 100-X% of the people would benefit secondarily because the people who benefit would have more money to buy services, building, etc.  Trouble is in the short term that X is probably less than 5% so that multiplier effect is not that big.The industry that has the most intractable 'national security' issues in my mind is the drone industry.  The problem there is that there are many American companies that would like to build expensive overpriced super-profitable drones for the military and other high-end consumers and none that want to build consumer-oriented drones at consumer-oriented prices.  [1]  Drones are transformational military because they are low cost and if you go to war with a handful of expensive overpriced drones against somebody who has an unlimited supply of cheap but deadly drones guess who ends up like the cavalry soldiers who faced tanks in WWI?There is a case for industrial policy there and tariffs could be a tool but you should really look at:  (1) what the Chinese did to get DJI established and (2) what the EU did to make Airbus into a competitor for Boeing.  From that latter point of view maybe we need a \"western\" competitor to DJI and not necessarily an \"American\" competitor.  There are a lot of things we would find difficult about Chinese-style industrial policy.  If I had to point to once critical difference it's that people here thought Solyndra was a scandal and maybe it was but China had Solyndra over and over again in the process to dominate solar panels and sure it hurt but...  they dominate solar panels.[1] I think of how Microsoft decided each project in the games division had to be 30% profitable just because they have other hyperprofitable business lines,  yet this is entirely delusionalreply"

      "It's important to note the plane is a Cozy Mk IV, which is an experimental light aircraft that is built at home out of foam and fiberglass by following instructions you get online. The design is very good, and hundreds have been flown over the last ~35 years, but Cozy pilots are the aviation equivalent of people who run Arch Linux as their daily driver; many of them are tweaking their aircraft with some frequency.This isn't a case of an established aircraft manufacturer cutting corners on a part; it's probably some small maker who made this part out of the wrong materials. It's a little shocking that neither the maker nor the buyer of this part thought to either stick it in an oven or run it with the engine on the ground to guarantee it could hold up to the expected intake air temps. I'm glad the pilot made it out with only mild injuries.edit: here's a fun video from a Cozy pilot in case you're curious about the plane and the people who fly them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipqmb09wbSQreply",

      "Actually, I think all of the jet engine manufacturers these days are using 3d printers for some of their parts?

      "You can see the layer lines in the part. WTF? I don\u2019t build aircraft parts. But I sure as hell wont use thermoplastics in this situation. I don\u2019t even 3D print parts for mildly hot environments where failure is just annoyance.Whoever built this should be charged.reply",
      "Yes, implicit was that it was an uncertified part 3D-printed by \"someone\" who sold it at an airshow. Obviously a certified part from the manufacturer is a different story.The 3D printing isn't the actual problem, as you note.reply",
      "It's not the \"3D printed\" aspect of the part that's driving the failure, it's that it's made out of thermoplastic. An injection molded part in this situation[1] would likely have failed in the same way.[1] It's not clear what the source of the heat was or where this was in the motor enclosure.  But yeah, one needs to be careful with structural plastic near running engines!reply",
      "Thermoplastic is the problem here. There are plenty of thermoset and other kinds of plastics that handle heat well and don\u2019t soften with heat in normal ranges. 3d printed thermoplastics typically need to be liquid at <300 C so the glass transition usually is closer to 200 or even less.
