This was a nice line:>  it\u2019s just embarrassing \u2014 it\u2019s as if the writer is walking around with their intellectual fly open.I think Oxide didn't include this in the RFD because they exclusively hire senior engineers, but in an organization that contains junior engineers I'd add something specific to help junior engineers understand how they should approach LLM use.Bryan has 30+ years of challenging software (and now hardware) engineering experience. He memorably said that he's worked on and completed a \"hard program\" (an OS), which he defines as a program you doubt you can actually get working.The way Bryan approaches an LLM is super different to how a 2025 junior engineer does so. That junior engineer possibly hasn't programmed without the tantalizing, even desperately tempting option to be assisted by an LLM.reply",

A privacy first approach would be something like this:`You+App --Read/Write->  f_private(your_data) <--Write only- 3p` and App cannot communicate your data to 3p or google/apple.Think of Yelp/Google Maps but with no _read_ permissions on location, functions can be run in a private middleware e.g. what's near  an anonymous location or ads based on anonymous data. You can wipe your data from one button click and start again for EVERYTHING, no data is ever stored on a 3p server. Bonus: No more stupid horrible permission fiascos for app development that are just plain creepy.1.

A high recall, opensource, 3D building and sattelite-shadow Data-Infra effort[3]. This world class dataset on shadows and sattelites are a must.

We would need device makers to upstream support so there is less worrying about reverse engineering or needing to run modified ROMs based on old builds. Or just publish specs on the hardware that is enough for implementation. Sure, you can buy a specific phone and run a de-googled android or linux, but that only really works for the hobbyist who wants to spend time doing this.

Yeah, Deepseek invented that for Deepseek V2 (and also V3 and Deepseek R1 etc)- They claim to use a hybrid linear attention architecture. So does Deepseek V3.2 and that was weeks ago. Or Granite 4, if you want to go even further back. Or Kimi Linear. Or Qwen3-Next.- They claimed to save a lot of money not doing a full pre-train run for millions of dollars. Well, so did Deepseek V3.2... Deepseek hasn't done a full $5.6mil full pretraining run since Deepseek V3 in 2024. Deepseek R1 is just a $294k post train on top of the expensive V3 pretrain run. Deepseek V3.2 is just a hybrid linear attention post-train run - i don't know the exact price, but it's probably just a few hundred thousand dollars as well.Hell, GPT-5, o3, o4-mini, and gpt-4o are all post-trains on top of the same expensive pre-train run for gpt-4o in 2024. That's why they all have the same information cutoff date.I don't really see anything new or interesting in this paper that isn't already something Deepseek V3.2 has already sort of done (just on a bigger scale). Not exactly the same, but is there anything amazingly new that's not in Deepseek V3.2?reply",
      "Here's what's important about this paper. It is written by AMD researchers. It shows AMD is investing in AI research. Is this the same level of achievement as DeepSeek 3.2. Most likely not. Do they have novel ideas? Difficult to say, there are hundreds of new ideas being tried in this space. Is this worthless? Most certainly not. In order to make progress in this domain (as in any other), you first need to get your feet wet. You need to play with the various components, and see how they fit together. The idea in this paper is that you can combine somehow SSMs (like Mamba) and LLMs (like LLama). The examples they give are absolute toys compared to DeepSeek 3.2 (the largest is 8 billion parameters, while DeepSeek 3.2 has 671 billion parameters). The comparison you are trying to make simply does not apply. The good news for all of us is that AMD is working in this space.reply",

      "Current OMSCS grad student; three down, seven to go. Loving the program so far.The content is great, and most of it is available on Open Courseware, YT, etc, but here's what else you get by officially going through the program:- the amazing community of TAs- the assignments- the feedback on reports & projects (either automated, or through TAs)- the collaboration with other students on Ed, Discord, Slack, etc- the forcing function of deadlines, having to study for exams, etc- free access to academic libraries, IEEE, ACM, O'Reilly, etc- access to software and services, educational packages from GitHub, Wolfram, Google Colab Pro, student discount in a bunch of places, etcAnother underrated aspect is GT's ability to preserve rigor of the program overall, despite the scale and number of students in some courses (the most popular ones have 1,000-1,500 students per semester).If you're on the fence on applying, I strongly recommend you do. The program is affordable enough that there's no harm in trying for a few semesters to see if matches what you're looking for.Glad to answer any questions.reply",
      "In reference to the open courseware, is there a way to either just download all of the videos in bulk, or view them as part of a single video? It looks like they're broken down into ~2 minute long video clips through the Ed platform, which is very annoying.reply",
      "OMSCS requires ten courses to graduate. I completed one course (with an A grade) before realizing that, even at a pace of one course per semester, it was not a high enough priority for me to devote the time required to do each course well.That course was great, though, and I definitely learned some things I'm glad to have learned!IMO the instructional materials are a small part of the value. The things that stood out to me were:- the assignments- the autograding of programming assignments- giving and receiving peer feedback about written assignments- learning some LaTeX for those assignments- having an artificial reason (course grade) to persist in improving my algorithm and code [on the problems taught in that course, I wouldn't have been self-motivated enough if they were just things I came across during a random weekend]reply",
      "The ability of OMSCS to scale paper writing, review, and grading with real human TAs is nothing short of astounding. While it's a ton of work (I'm just completing class #5) it's a great resource for both learning the material - and how to communicate it effectively.reply",

I can say that the assignments were an important part of the learning experience, for instance the practical experience of attacking weak RSA keys.I would not let the lack of assignments, tests, and quizzes stop you from trying these if you are interested.  At a minimum, they would give you a feeling for what the program/s are like, and possibly encourage you to enroll into the online degree program, which is an exceptional value.reply",

      "If the Unicode consortium would spend less time and effort on emoji and more on making the most common/important mathematical symbols and notations available/renderable in plain text, maybe we could move past the (LA)TeX/PDF marriage. OpenType and TrueType now (edit: for well over a decade, actually) support the necessary conditional rendering required to perform complicated rendering operations to get sequences of Unicode code points to display in the way needed (theoretically, anyway) and with fallback missing-glyph-only font family substitution support available pretty much everywhere allowing you to seamlessly display symbols not in your primary font from a fallback asset (something like Noto, with every Unicode symbol supported by design, or math-specific fonts like Cambria Math or TeX Gyre, etc), there are no technical restrictions.I\u2019ve actually dug into this in the past and it was never lack of technical ability that prevented them from even adding just proper superscript/subscript support before, but rather their opinion that this didn\u2019t belong in the symbolic layer. But since emoji abuse/rely on ZWJ and modifiers left and right to display in one of a myriad of variations, there\u2019s really no good reason not to allow the same, because 2 and the squares symbol are not semantically the same (so it\u2019s not a design choice).An interesting (complete) tangent is that Gemini 3 Pro is the only model I\u2019ve tested (I do a lot of math-related stuff with LLMs) that absolutely will not under any circumstances respect (system/user) prompt requests to avoid inline math mode (aka LATeX) in the output, regardless of whether I asked for a blanket ban on TeX/MathJax/etc or when I insisted that it use extended unicode codes points to substitute all math formula rendering (I primarily use LLMs via the TUI where I don\u2019t have MathJax support, and as familiar as I once was with raw TeX mathematical notations and symbols, it\u2019s still quite easy to confuse unrendered raw output by missing something if you\u2019re not careful). I shared my experiment and results here \u2013 Gemini 3 Pro would insist on even rendering single letter constants or variables as $k$ instead of just k (or k in markdown italics, etc) no matter how hard I asked it not to (which makes me think it may have been overfit against raw LATeX papers, and is also an interesting argument in favor of the \u201cVL LLMs are the more natural construct\u201d):\nhttps://x.com/NeoSmart/status/1995582721327071367?s=20reply",

The effect is comparable to roughly five years younger biological age.Telomeres are structures that protect DNA. As people get older, their telomeres shorten as part of the natural human ageing process. This process has been shown to be accelerated among people with severe mental illness, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, who have an average life expectancy 15 years shorter than the general population.Previous research shows that coffee possesses health benefits. It may reduce oxidative stress in the general population, helping slow biological ageing processes like telomere shortening. The new study, published in BMJ Mental Health, explores whether coffee consumption could slow this ageing process among those with severe mental illness."

It also turns out that a ring can invoke a wedding on its own but in many cases, it also requires way more complexity.You might start off with much a simpler case, with an entity called a number.  How you define that thing is up to you.I might hazard that maths is about entities and relationships.

      "The article by mathematician John Kemeny, who amongst other things was an assistant to Albert Einstein at the IAS, describes four methods of applying mathematics to problems that are not innately about numbers (algebraic) or space (geometric). He divides the space of such methods firstly into a) not using numbers, b) introducing artificial numbers, and secondly also into using either 1) algebra or 2) geometry.For geometry not using numbers, he shows how graph theory can be applied to the problem of social balance as defined by psychologist Fritz Heider. This example is based on work by Dorwin Cartwright and Frank Harary.For algebra not using numbers, he chooses the theory of group actions, and applies it to a way of preventing incestuous relationships that was used in some cultures, which works by assigning each child a group that they are exclusively allowed to marry in. This example is based on work by Andr\u00e9 Weil and Robert R. Bush.For geometry using numbers, he uses an adjancency matrix to show how you can find out how many ways there are to send a message from one person to another in a network.For algebra using numbers, he defines axioms for a distance function for rankings with ties, which can be shown to be unique (probably up to some isomorphy), and which can be used to derive a consensus ranking from a set of rankings. This appears to be the central piece of the article, as that is an example that he developed himself together with J.L. Snell and which was yet to be published.reply"

      "I think part of the tension here comes from the way autism is understood both as a broad, fully-continuous, multivariate spectrum, and as a binary diagnosis.To be sure, clinically, thresholds are useful because services, insurance, and research all rely on clear binary classifications, in our current society. But outside that context, it isn\u2019t obvious that everyday language needs to mirror that line. Self-identification can be a way of making sense of one\u2019s life, not an attempt to claim a clinical label.But at the same time, the spectrum includes people with very high support needs, and there\u2019s understandable concern that broad or casual uses of the term can hide those realities in ways that impact care.To me, none of this means people are wrong for wondering about autism. And I do not have the experience to advocate for or against \"anxiety disorders\" being weighted more heavily in clinicians' priors than they currently are (as the OP article heavily implies with its length). I mean only to highlight the mismatch between a binary diagnostic system and a very heterogeneous spectrum, and the need for language that acknowledges self-understanding without flattening anyone\u2019s experience.reply",
      "The largest confusion with Autism is the ever changing definition from one DSM to the next where whole areas are suddenly included and others excluded.It seems in the DSM 5 the definition was narrowed specifically to focus on two performance deficits: 1) immediate harms either to the inflicted or to those they interact with due to social interactions, 2) catastrophic academic failures due strictly to input/output perception irregularities not otherwise explained by neuro-transmission disorders (things that can be treated with drugs) or low intelligence measures.That excludes a massive host of social and perception abnormalities that do result in less immediate social rejection and abstract reasoning failures.reply",
      "As far as I can tell, the definition of autism coincides with the desire of healthcare to address it without having to carve out 100+ variations of behavioral outcomes to get insurance to pay for it.We know autism affects all sorts of long term outcomes, but if you tried to split it into actual diagnoses, you end up with insurance companies dividing and conquering approvals.So instead of having several definitions, we put them all behind autism because that has already received appreopiate laws that establish requirements to treat both at school and in healthcare settings.So basically, once it breached the \"we need to address this\", rather than every new diagnosis having to struggle to say \"look, this problem effects society\", it just grows offshoots and spectrum status.Because it's definitely not a physically identifiable disability. It's all behavioral and that will always have more coincidences.reply",
      "BTW, there's research that shows that schizotypy (schizotypal/schizophrenia) is sort of the opposite of autism. You have to squint your eyes a bit, for example both of these neurotypes involve social difficulties, like the subjective feeling of being alien in the world (known as Anderssein in German psychiatry). However if you peel off the social layer then the remaining autistic features become anti-correlated with the remaining schizotypal features on the scale of the population. There are also some decent theories that suggest this should be the case - for example in the predictive coding theory it is believed that autistic brains over-weigh sensory inputs over their model of the world, whereas schizotypal brains over-weigh their model of the world over the sensory inputs. Or the Big Five traits, openness to experience is usually low in autism and high in schizophrenia.reply",
      "If the mind is a kind of \"prediction machine\", wouldn't that make ALL psychiactric disorders a specific variation of faulty prediction mode though?reply",
      "Given we're long evolved, and also tribal based animals, and that culture is an evolutionary pressure feedback mechanism, and prediction is fundamentally useful to our reality, different \"thinking styles\" (ways to predict/understand outcomes) are useful, aannnd, tribally we used people for their usefulness, I often wonder if \"faulty\" is the correct lens. That is to say, If prediction variation was useful to tribes, having both 'trust the model' and 'trust the senses' type people, I suppose framing these as disorders rather than trade offs is probably the wrong lens entirely. Society/culture/reality is so narrow and predictable these days, faulty in what context, you know? If you breed 20 generations of \"best night watchers\", in the jungle at night looking down, quiet, still, dark... you'd probably be selecting for specific traits, and creating new traits, retinal rod density and sensitivity, faster dark adaptation/contrast etc, attention/vigilance traits, pattern detection, anxiety adjacent traits in hypervigilance, \nprob something about circadian rhythm tolerance etc etc. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40886135_Not_By_Gen...)reply",
      "it becomes a disorder when the person faces \"too many\" difficulties due to their difference (instead of enjoying the advantages)and of course there are extreme cases, like the many non-verbal people (who likely wouldn't be able to live alone, their communication is limited to poking at pictures on a board), and the truly end of the spectrum where nothing sort of institutionalization can provide the environment and care necessary for survivalbut of course having our society somehow become so narrow allows for the economic efficiency to even have the surplus that then we give to people with these disorders (in the form or care, attention, medical research, and so on)reply",
      "Yes, having society \"somehow\" became ordered for a certain \"norm\" on a spectrum certain does create a disordered reality for the others...reply",
      "Yes, but not always faulty. My (diagnosed) OCD and Anxiety have saved me from many bad situation. I see the many many many possibilities that something can go wrong and I have very low risk tolerance.reply",
      "I don't think there's much underlying relationship.  True they will both impact social relationships.  But it's more like how being blind or being deaf will impact social relationships.  The mechanics might be the same but the cause is very different.IMHO schizophrenia is a breakdown in the barrier between imagination and processing of reality.Autism and the like is an inability to process social cues like a blind person might have a damaged visual cortex.reply"
