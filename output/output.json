      "I work at Harmonic, the company behind Aristotle.To clear up a few misconceptions:- Aristotle uses modern AI techniques heavily, including language modeling.- Aristotle can be guided by an informal (English) proof. If the proof is correct, Aristotle has a good chance at translating it into Lean (which is a strong vote of confidence that your English proof is solid). I believe that's what happened here.- Once a proof is formalized into Lean (assuming you have formalized the statement correctly), there is no doubt that the proof is correct. This is the core of our approach: you can do a lot of (AI-driven) search, and once you find the answer you are certain it's correct no matter how complex the solution is.Happy to answer any questions!reply",
      "How do you verify that the AI translation to Lean is a correct formalization of the problem?  In other fields, generative AI is very good at making up plausible sounding lies, so I'm wondering how likely that is for this usage.reply",
      "First congrats!Sometimes when I'm using new LLMs I'm not sure if it\u2019s a step forward or just benchmark hacking, but formalized math results always show that the progress is real and huge.When do you think Harmonic will reach formalizing most (even hard) human written math?I saw an interview with Christian Szegedy (your competitor I guess) that he believes it will be this year.reply",
      "Is anyone working on applying these techniques to formal verification of software?I'm imagining something like the Rust borrow checker, but able to handle human complexity proofs.Editing...reply",
      "Based on Tao\u2019s description of how the proof came about - a human is taking results backwards and forwards between two separate AI tools and using an AI tool to fill in gaps the human found?I don\u2019t think it can really be said to have occurred autonomously then?Looks more like a 50/50 partnership with a super expert human one the one side which makes this way more vague in my opinion - and in line with my own AI tests, ie. they are pretty stupid even OPUS 4.5 or whatever unless you're already an expert and is doing boilerplate.EDIT: I can see the title has been fixed now from solved to \"more or less solved\" which is still think is a big stretch.reply",
      "You're understanding correctly, this is back and forth between Aristotle and ChatGPT and a (very smart) user.reply",
      "I'm not sure i understand the wild hype here in this thread then.Seems exactly like the tests at my company where even frontier models are revealed to be very expensive rubber ducks, but completely fails with non experts or anything novel or math heavy.Ie. they mirror the intellect of the user but give you big dopamine hits that'll lead you astray.reply",
      "Yes, the contributions of the people promoting the AI should be considered, as well as the people who designed the Lean libraries used in-the-loop while the AI was writing the solution. Any talk of \"AGI\" is, as always, ridiculous.But speaking as a specialist in theorem proving, this result is pretty impressive! It would have likely taken me a lot longer to formalize this result even if it was in my area of specialty.reply",
      "> Any talk of \"AGI\" is, as always, ridiculous.How did you arrive at \"ridiculous\"? What we're seeing here is incredible progress over what we had a year ago. Even ARC-AGI-2 is now at over 50%. Given that this sort of process is also being applied to AI development itself, it's really not clear to me that humans would be a valuable component in knowledge work for much longer.reply",

In fact, part of the effort is in aligning data and tweaking constants with Crinkler's algorithm in mind, to make the raw data more amenable to compression!

      "This is a funny project. Too many people taking this serious, it is more of a 'can it be done' because the physical interfaces suggest that it should be possible, and then to follow through on it to prove that yes it actually can be done. And tbh much better than I expected it to work. I can imagine that for GPU compute heavy and interconnect bandwidth constrained applications a combination like this might actually be useful. You essentially just added an ethernet port to a 5090, there must be some value in that.reply",
      "it's extra funny to me because the Raspberry Pi SoC is basically a little CPU riding on a big GPU (well, the earlier ones were. Maybe the latest ones shift the balance of power a bit). In fact, to this day the GPU is still the one driving the boot sequence.So plugging a RasPi into a 5090 is \"just\" swapping the horse for one 10,000x bigger (someone correct my ratio of the RasPi5 GPU to the RTX5090)reply",

Everything looked great, until we brought one somewhere and untethered it from ethernet, and we started getting bizarre hangs. Turned out the wifi was close enough to the PCIe ribbon cable that bursts of wifi broadcasts were enough to disrupt the signal to the SSD, and essentially unmount it (taking root with it).

For this experiment, I\u2019ll move it into the slower (x1) slot and plug the eGPU into the faster (x4) slot.Pretty comparable to the Raspberry Pi 5 (it\u2019s ARM), but the extra cores give it a little more horsepower.

Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and achieving.... The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.He delivered that speech in 2005. Before the modern smartphone. All those people I mentioned earlier were strangers. That's no longer the case because all of us chose to interrupt what we were doing and open up a little to someone unfamiliar. It's a choice.

Maybe not to everyone's taste, but the firewall management is a lot less of a clusterfuck than trying to properly configure simple port redirects over the command line.

It is designed to help developers easily expose local services to external networks without requiring manual router configuration for users.By leveraging UPnP, QtNat automatically communicates with compatible routers to create port forwarding rules at runtime. This makes it particularly useful for peer-to-peer applications, multiplayer games, remote access tools, and any software that needs reliable inbound connectivity behind a NAT.QtNat provides a simplified API to do all steps automatically: discovery and mapping. This has been tested on my local device. Feel free to test it and improve it.Basically, we need to know if there is a upnp server around. \nTo do so, we send an M-SEARCH request on the multicast address.Here is the code: The whole goal of the discovery is to get the description file from the server with all available devices and services.\nThe result is s"

      "If this model is so good at estimating depth from single image, shouldn't it also be able to take multiple images as input and estimate even better? But searching a bit it looks like this is supposed to be a single image to 3D only. I don't understand why it does not (can not?) work with multiple images.reply",
      "It's using Apple's SHARP method, which is monocular.\nhttps://apple.github.io/ml-sharp/reply",
      "I also feel like an heavily multimodal model could be very nice for this: allow multiple images from various angles, optionally some true depth data even if imperfect (like what a basic phone LIDAR would output), why not even photos of the same place even if it comes from other sources at other times (just to gather more data), and based on that generate a 3D scene you can explore, using generative AI for filling with plausible content what is missing.reply",
      "I'm going to guess this is because the image to depth data, while good, is not perfectly accurate and therefore cannot be a shared ground truth between multiple images.  At that point what you want is a more traditional structure from motion workflow, which already exists and does a decent job.reply",
      "If you have multiple images you could use photogrammetry.At the end, if you want to \"fill in the blanks\" llm will always \"make up\" stuff, based on all of its training data.With a technology like photogrammetry you can get much better results, therefor if you have multiple angled images and dont really need to make up stuff, its better to use suchreply",
      "You could use both. Photogrammetry requires you to have a lot of additional information, and/or to make a lot of assumptions (e.g. about camera, specific lens properties, medium properties, material composition and properties, etc. - and what are reasonable range for values in context), if you want it to work well for general cases, as otherwise the problem you're solving is underspecified. In practice, even enumerating those assumptions is a huge task, much less defending them. That's why photogrammetry applications tend to be used for solving very specific problems in select domains.ML models, on the other hand, are in a big way, intuitive assumption machines. Through training, they learn what's likely and what's not, given both the input measurements and the state of the world. They bake in knowledge for what kind of cameras exist, what kind of measurements are being made, what results make sense in the real world.In the past I'd say that for best results, we should combine the two approaches - have AI supply assumptions and estimates for otherwise explicitly formal, photogrammetric approach. Today, I'm no longer convinced it's the case - because relative to the fuzzy world modeling part, the actual math seems trivial and well within capabilities of ML models to do correctly. The last few years demonstrated that ML models are capable of internally modeling calculations and executing them, so I now feel it's more likely that a sufficiently trained model will just do photogrammetry calculations internally.

      "Tried a few random images and scenes, overall wasn't that impressive. Maybe I'm using the wrong kinds of input images or something, but for the most part once I moved more than a small amount, the rendering was mostly noise. To be fair, I didn't really expect much more.Neat demo, but feels like things need to come quite a ways to make this interesting.reply"

Why not go right to the metal?If anyone's ever tried this, it's clear why: AI is terrible at C and ASM. But that cuts into what AI is at its core: It's not actual programming, it's mechanical reproduction.Which means its incapabilities in C and ASM don't disappear when using it for higher-level languages.

      "My small-program success story with genAI coding is pretty much the opposite of your claim.  I used to use a bash script with a few sox instances piped into each other to beat-match and mix a few tracks.  Couldn't use a GUI... Then came gpt-5, and I wanted to test it anyway.  So I had it write a single-file C++ program that does the track database, offline mixing, limiter and a small REPL-based \"UI\" to control the thing.  I basically had results before my partner was finished preparing breakfast.  Then I had a lot of fun bikeshedding the resulting code until it felt like something I'd like to read.  Some back and forth, pretending to have an intern and just reviewing/fixing their code.  During the whole experience, it basically never generated code which wouldn't compile.  Had a single segfault which was due to unclear interface to a C library.  Got that fixed quickly.And now, I have a tool to do a (shuffled if I want) beat-matched mix of all the tracks in my db which match a certain tag expression. \"(dnb | jungle) & vocals\", wait a few minutes, and play a 2 hour beat-matched mix, finally replacing mpd's \"crossfade\" feature.

That's been true for abstractions, for frameworks, for all kinds of time-saving tools. Sometimes that cost is felt quickly, as we've seen with vibe coding.So I'm more interested in using AI in the research phase and to increase the breadth of what I can work on than to save time.Over the course of a project, all approaches, even total hand-coding with no LLMs whatever, likely regress to the mean when it comes to hours worked.
