      "I couldn't get this to run successfully.More broadly, I have concerns about introducing a middleware layer over AWS infrastructure. A misinterpreted command or bug could lead to serious consequences. The risk feels different from something like k9s, since AWS resources frequently include stateful databases, production workloads, and infrastructure that's far more difficult to restore.I appreciate the effort that went into this project and can see the appeal of a better CLI experience. But personally, I'd be hesitant to use this even for read-only operations. The direct AWS cli/console at least eliminates a potential failure point.Curious if others have thoughts on the risk/benefit tradeoff here.reply",

I grew up using actual green screen terminals, and the advent of high-resolution colour monitors and applications with dark text on a white background felt like a blessing.  I truly do not understand the regression to dark mode.  It's eyestrain hell for me.Unfortunately, I was unable to test in my light-background terminal, since the application crashes on startup.reply",

      "> At scale, even your bugs have users.First place I worked right out of college had a big training seminar for new hires. One day we were told the story of how they\u2019d improved load times from around 5min to 30seconds, this improvement was in the mid 90s. The negative responses from clients were instant. The load time improvements had destroyed their company culture. Instead of everyone coming into the office, turning on their computers, and spending the next 10min chatting and drinking coffee the software was ready before they\u2019d even stood up from their desk!The moral of the story, and the quote, isn\u2019t that you shouldn\u2019t improve things. Instead it\u2019s a reminder that the software you\u2019re building doesn\u2019t exist in a PRD or a test suite. It\u2019s a system that people will interact with out there in the world. Habits with form, workarounds will be developed, bugs will be leaned for actual use cases.This makes it critically important that you, the software engineer, understand the purpose and real world usage of your software. Your job isn\u2019t to complete tickets that fulfill a list of asks from your product manager. Your job is to build software that solves users problems.reply",
      "> The load time improvements had destroyed their company culture. Instead of everyone coming into the office, turning on their computers, and spending the next 10min chatting and drinking coffeeOne of my early tasks as a junior engineer involved some automation work in a warehouse. It got assigned to me, the junior, because it involved a lot of time working in the warehouse instead of at a comfortable desk.I assumed I\u2019d be welcomed and appreciated for helping make their work more efficient, but the reality was not that simple. The more efficient I made the technical part of the job, the more time they had to spend doing the manual labor part of the job to keep up. So the more I reduced cycle times, the less time they had to sit around and chat.Mind you, the original process was extremely slow and non-parallel so they had a lot of time to wait. The job was still very easy. I spent weeks doing it myself to test and optimize and to this day it\u2019s the easiest manual labor job I\u2019ve ever worked. Yet I as the anti-hero for ruining the good thing they had going.reply",
      "One of my work involved automating some process which was very manual and tedious, took a lot of time and there was dedicated employee for that process. After I did the project, it turned out that this job wasn't necessary anymore and that employee was fired. I felt uneasy about the whole situation.reply",
      "And they will have to go find another job instead. It feels weird but this is how we raise living standards - removing human labor from production (or, in other words, increasing the amount produced per human)Automation is a game of diffuse societal benefit at the expense of a few workers. Well, I guess owners also benefit but in the long term that extra profit is competed away.reply",
      "\"Laid off\" may be more appropriate than \"fired\", but in essence, removing the need for costly labor is often the main \"value\" of any technology. Society as a whole comes out ahead from it, I mean for all the ice transporters and merchants put out of a job by electric refrigeration, and all the sailors put out of a job by modern cargo ships I think we're better off for it. But at the individual level it does make one uneasy about the prospects of individuals affected by it. My personal conclusion is that people have a personal duty to anticipate and adapt to change, society might give them some help along the way but it doesn't owe them that their way of life will be maintained forever.reply",

This is just someone discovering something new and sharing it very excitedly.Almost 6-7 years ago, I read about a 30min challenge to sit upright without doing anything in a chair challenge. That changed how I think about distractions. If I had written about it, there surely will be people who would just like here say... What is so crazy about it? I do that all the time...To me, this post is someone's joy and curiosity shared through a well written piece. Everybody discover certain things at different stages of their lives.

      "Trying to sit still for 30 min without any stimulation at all (no talking, watching, reading) sounds like torture to me.reply",
      "I was felt that for much of my life. Time without stimulation was, if not scary, at least a bit panic inducing. Learning to sit without stimulation, without any distractions from my worries, led to being able to realize that \"hey, I'm OK, I don't even need those worries.\" Which led to handling the underlying pressures and stresses MUCH better, without panic, without stress, with a full clear mind. I could apply my full intellect to things that before were hard to deal with. It felt like a super power when I first started practicing sitting.reply",
      "It can be at first until you get used to it. You can observe your surroundings, make up stories about what is happening. Ask yourself questions. Listen to yourself.This is a bit like excercise. When you first start, 30 minutes of exercise can be torture as your is out of shape and not used to the effort. Keep doing it and it feels better and you feel better.Work on becoming a source of thoughts rather than a consumer of thoughts.reply",
      "People talk about this with exercise and I\u2019ve never understood it. As someone who has exercised continuously for years - it has never gotten better.Which, to me, makes sense because you\u2019re supposed to always be pushing yourself. You\u2019re not supposed to ever feel comfortable or feel better from it. You should always feel shitty because if it doesn\u2019t hurt then you\u2019re probably not making optimal development.The only thing I ever \u201cfeel\u201d good about is purely a mental thing. Eg I hit a new PR (progress), didn\u2019t skip a lift (perseverance), or whatever. The act of exercising itself is always painful and it\u2019s why I always dread it.reply",

You\u2019ve reduced this to some narrow set of activities that presumably make you stronger, faster, or better at some other easy to measure metric.

The 80286 did things \"properly\" again and went all-in on the segments when going to virtual memory...and sucked.  Best I remember, it was used almost exclusively as a faster 8086, with the 80286 modes used to page memory in and out and with the \"reset and recover\" hack to then get back to real mode for real work.The 80386 introduced the flat address space and paged virtual memory not because of backwards-compatibility, but because it could and it was clearly The Right Thing\u2122.reply",
      "> Because the attempts at segmented or object-oriented address spaces failed miserably.> That is false. In the Intel World, we first had the iAPX 432, which was an object-capability design. To say it failed miserably is overselling its success by a good margin.I would further posit that segmented and object-oriented address spaces have failed and will continue to fail for as long as we have a separation into two distinct classes of storage: ephemeral (DRAM) and persistent storage / backing store (disks, flash storage, etc.) as opposed to having a single, unified concept of nearly infinite (at least logically if not physically), always-on just memory where everything is \u2013 essentially \u2013 an object.Intel's Optane has given us a brief glimpse into what such a future could look like but, alas, that particular version of the future has not panned out.Linear address space makes perfect sense for size-constrained DRAM, and makes little to no sense for the backing store where a file system is instead entrusted with implementing an object-like address space (files, directories are the objects, and the file system is the address space).Once a new, successful memory technology emerges, we might see a resurgence of the segmented or object-oriented address space models, but until then, it will remain a pipe dream.reply",
      "I don't see how any amount of memory technology can overcome the physical realities of locality. The closer you want the data to be to your processor, the less space you'll have to fit it. So there will always be a hierarchy where a smaller amount of data can have less latency, and there will always be an advantage to cramming as much data as you can at the top of the hierarchy.reply",
      "I shudder to think about the impact of concurrent data structures fsync'ing on every write because the programmer can't reason about whether the data is in memory where a handful of atomic fences/barriers are enough to reason about the correctness of the operations, or on disk where those operations simply do not exist.Also linear regions make a ton of sense for disk, and not just for performance. WAL-based systems are the cornerstone of many databases and require the ability to reserve linear regions.reply",
      "> Show me somebody who calls the IBM S/360 a RISC design, and I will show you somebody who works with the s390 instruction set today.Ahaha so true.But to answer the post's main question:> Why do we even have linear physical and virtual addresses in the first place, when pretty much everything today is object-oriented?Because backwards compatibility is more valuable than elegant designs. Because array-crunching performance is more important than safety. Because a fix for a V8 vulnerability can be quickly deployed while a hardware vulnerability fix cannot. Because you can express any object model on top of flat memory, but expressing one object model (or flat memory) in terms of another object model usually costs a lot. Because nobody ever agreed of what the object model should be. But most importantly: because \"memory safety\" is not worth the costs.reply",
      "But we don't have a linear address space, unless you're working with a tiny MCU. For last like 30 years we have virtual address space on every mainstream processor, and we can mix and match pages the way we want, insulate processes from one another, add sentinel pages at the ends of large structures to generate a fault, etc. We just structure process heaps as linear memory, but this is not a hard requirement, even on current hardware.What we lack is the granularity that something like iAPX432 envisioned. Maybe some hardware breakthrough would allow for such granularity cheaply enough (like it allowed for signed pointers, for instance), so that smart compilers and OSes would offer even more protection without the expense of switching to kernel mode too often. I wonder what research exists in this field.reply",
      "> But we don't have a linear address space, unless you're working with a tiny MCU.We actually do, albeit for a brief duration of time \u2013 upon a cold start of the system when the MCU is inactive yet, no address translation is performed, and the entire memory space is treated as a single linear, contiguous block (even if there are physical holes in it).When a system is powered on, the CPU runs in the privileged mode to allow an operating system kernel to set up the MCU and activate it, which takes place early on in the boot sequence. But until then, virtual memory is not available.reply",
      "Those holes can be arbitrarily large, though, especially in weirder environments (e.g., memory-mapped optane and similar).  Linear address space implies some degree of contiguity, I think.reply",
      "Indeed. It can get ever weirder in the embedded world where a ROM, an E(E)PROM or a device may get mapped into an arbitrary slice of physical address space, anywhere within its bounds. It has become less common, though.But devices are still commonly mapped at the top of the physical address space, which is a rather widespread practice.reply",
      "its entirely possible to implement segments on top of paging. what you need to do is add the kernel abstractions for implementing call gates that change segment visibility, and write some infrastructure to manage unions-of-a-bunch-of-little-regions.

When it opened, it clearly told me that \u201cthe answers in this chatbot are generated by AI\u201d, which is good disclosure but immediately raised my curiosity about how it worked and what its limits were.Eurostar publishes a vulnerability disclosure programme (VDP), which meant I had permission to take a closer look at the chatbot\u2019s behaviour as long as I stayed within those rules. So this work was done while using the site as a legitimate customer, within the scope of the VDP.Almost all websites for companies like train operators have a chatbot on them. What we\u2019re used to seeing is a menu-driven bot which attempts to direct you to available FAQ pages or help articles, trying to minimise interactions which require putting you in front of a human being operator on the other end.

You don't need to carve out 2-4 hours to ramp up any more.If you have significant previous coding experience - even if it's a few years stale - you can drive these things extremely effectively.

      "Not all browsers had or have a DOM, and some didn\u2019t until later versions.Early browsers without DOMs (with initial release date): WorldWideWeb (Nexus) (Dec 1990), Erwise (Apr 1992), ViolaWWW (May 1992), Lynx (1992), NCSA Mosaic 1.0 (Apr 1993), Netscape 1.0 (Dec 1994), and IE 1.0 (Aug 1995).Note: Lynx remains a non-DOM browser by design.AOL 1.0\u20132.0 (1994\u20131995) used the AOLPress engine which was static with no programmable objects.The ability to interact with the DOM began with \"Legacy DOM\" (Level 0) in Netscape 2.0 (Sept 1995), IE 3.0 (Aug 1996), AOL 3.0 (1996, via integrated IE engine), and Opera 3.0 (1997). Then there was an intermediate phase in 1997 where Netscape 4.0 (document.layers) and IE 4.0 (document.all) each used their own model.The first universal standard was the W3C DOM Level 1 Recommendation (Oct 1998). Major browsers adopted this slowly: IE 5.0 (Mar 1999) offered partial support, while Konqueror 2.0 (Oct 2000) and Netscape 6.0 (Nov 2000) were the first W3C-compliant engines (KHTML and Gecko).Safari 1.0 (2003), Firefox 1.0 (2004), and Chrome 1.0 (2008) launched with native standard DOM support from version 1.0.Currently most major browser engines follow the WHATWG DOM Living Standard to supports real-time feature implementation.reply",

      "> Would be writing something like \"DOM in the modern browsers\" more correct then?No, I don't think so. I don't know why the GP comment is at the top beyond historical interest. If you continue with your plans mentioned elsewhere to cover things like layout, rendering, scripting, etc, under this standard almost everything will have to have the \"in modern browsers\" added to it.Part of the problem is the term \"DOM\" is overloaded. Fundamentally it's an API, so in that sense it only has meaning for a browser to \"have a DOM\" if it supports scripting that can use that API. And, in fact, all browsers that ever shipped with scripting have had some form of a DOM API (going back to the retroactively named DOM Level 0). That makes sense, because what's the point of scripting if it can't interact with page contents in some way?So, \"Lynx remains a non-DOM browser by design\" is true, but only in the sense that it's not scripted at all, so of course it doesn't have DOM APIs, the same way it remains a non-canvas browser and a non-webworker browser. There's no javascript to use those things (it's a non-cssanimation browser too).There's a looser sense of the \"DOM\", though, that refers to how HTML parsers turn an HTML text document into the tree structure that will then be interpreted for layout, rendering, etc.The HTML spec[1] uses this language (\"User agents must use the parsing rules described in this section to generate the DOM trees from text/html resources\"), but notes it's for parsing specification convenience to act as if you'll end up with a DOM tree at the end of parsing, even if you don't actually use it as a DOM tree (\"Implementations that do not support scripting do not have to actually create a DOM Document object, but the DOM tree in such cases is still used as the model for the rest of the specification.\")In that broader sense, all browsers, even non-modern ones (and Lynx) \"have a DOM\", since they're all parsing a text resource and turning it into some data structure that will be used for layout and rendering, even if it's the very simple layouts of the first browsers, or the subset of layout that browsers like Lynx support.[1] https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.htmlreply",

I haven\u2019t finished reading it but I remember there\u2019s part of it that goes over the trade offs of increasing vs decreasing TLS frame sizes which is a low level knob I now know exists because of HPBN.

I was pretty decent at painting (quickly and accurately) and several kiddies used to pay me to get their latest regiment of space marines into action with the right colours.  I went to a posh school and some of the kids had a lot more disposable income than me.   I also had a lot more free time than I do now.Nowadays I own a 3D printer (Prusa 4S+ with nobs on upgraded from a 3) and an IT company.16 year old me would have committed ... a minor crime ... for the printer but given that IT was a Commodore 64, I'm not sure how I would have driven the thing.However a 16 y/o me today with a 3D printer probably would be printing armies out of filament.  I used to make plastic models too and saved up for several months to buy a double action air brush.  My printer can churn out a small scale tank that rivals a Tamiya effort from back in the day.  Some finishing is required but not much.I might have a go at some Warhammer models and see how it goes, just for old time's sake ...reply",
      "Pretty much the same age, generation and story. I also remember Traveller and Car  Wars, and when 40K was first released as Rogue Trader (and when GW said that they were keeping plastic mini prices comparable to lead minis because the injection moulding equipment was really expensive, but once they'd paid that off they'd be reducing the price of plastic minis dramatically. hahahhahahhahhahah).I had a go at FDM printing some minis, for old times' sake, and it didn't go well. The best resolution that I can get to is around 0.1mm, which is incredibly slow to print, and still not fine enough. The print layers are still visible, the detail is blurred. Sanding doesn't help that much; the face is still a mess. You can't paint individual eyeballs on them.If you remember the first generation of plastic gobbos and dwarves in the Warhammer (not 40K) beginner box released back in the early 90's, where they obviously had two-part moulds and there were no underhangs anywhere on the models, then my FDM versions were more shit than those.The author is spot-on about the hobby, and about the business model, and about 3D printing's place in it.But have a go, it's a fun challenge for a 3D printer enthusiast :)reply",

I don\u2019t need what it offers that bad, the amount of money and time I\u2019m going to put toward it in the rest of my life is zero.

      "Hey folks \u2014 here\u2019s a small experiment I hacked together over the weekend:https://cleoselene.com/In short, it\u2019s a way to build multiplayer games with no client-side game logic. Everything is rendered on the server, and the game itself is written as simple Lua scripts.I built this to explore a few gamedev ideas I\u2019ve been thinking about while working on Abstra:\n- Writing multiplayer games as if they were single-player (no client/server complexity)\n- Streaming game primitives instead of pixels, which should be much lighter\n- Server-side rendering makes cheating basically impossible\n- Game secrets never leave the serverThis isn\u2019t meant to be a commercial project \u2014 it\u2019s just for fun and experimentation for now.If you want to try it out, grab a few friends and play here:\nhttps://cleoselene.com/astro-maze/reply",
      "Interesting approach! I've thought about a similar method after reading about the PLATO platform.When playing astro\u2011maze, the delay is noticeable, and in a 2D action game such delays are especially apparent. Games that don\u2019t rely on tight real\u2011time input might perform better. (I'm connecting from Europe, though.)If you add support for drawing from images (such as spritesheets or tilesheets) in the future, and the client stores those images and sounds locally, the entire screen could be drawn from these assets, so no pixel data would need to be transferred, only commands like \"draw tile 56 at position (x, y).\"(By the way, opening abstra.io in a German-language browser leads to https://www.abstra.io/deundefined which shows a 404 error.)reply",
      "Yeah.. As people are playing and I'm watching their feedbacks it is becoming clear to me that the main source of input delay comes from the distance to the server.. the whole game is running in a single machine in SFO, so it makes total sense this bad exp in europeI think this is inevitable unless I add some optimism/interpolation in the clientAlso, thanks for the feedback! I will fix the Abstra landing pagetry https://www.abstra.io/en insteadreply",
      "Reminds me of the cave X11 games.  For game play I'd suggest slowing it way down.reply",
      "good feedback! I'm seeing people really struggly with the control lag + speed.I'm always biased since I test locally with no delay when developing :)reply",
      "Cheating with AI will be possible even with server side rendering ; nvidia has released models able to learn to play - it's going to be very difficult to detect whether it's an AI or a human ; very impressive howeverreply",
      "That\u2019s a very different kind of cheating though. The kind of cheating this effectively makes impossible is cheating where a player has more information than they\u2019re intended to have.If someone makes an AI that plays the game as a good player, then it\u2019s effectively indistinguishable from a real player who is good. If they make it super-humanly good, then it would probably be detectable anyway.It\u2019s still fair in the sense that all players have the same (intended) information per the game rules.reply",
      "I\u2019m also curious if an AI could process the screen feed quickly enough to compete in first-person shooter games. Seems like it would be difficult without extremely high end hardware for the foreseeable future?reply",
      "Cool! Besides the productizing or making a framework, I\u2019m trying to understand if this is different than the elementary idea (which probably every game dev who worked on game networking has tinkered with) of sending inputs to the server and then sending player positions back to all the clients\u2026? I think even smaller footprint would be position: two or three floats x,y(,z) instead of shapes too? Anyway this is always fine for very low latency environments where client side prediction, lag comp etc would not be required. Thanks for sharing, I might give it a try! sorry if I\u2019m missing something.reply",
      "You're correctMy approach lives in some place between video streaming and data streaming in terms of performanceIt's not intended to be faster than a proper client that brings a lot of logic and information that diminish the amount of information required to be transferedMy proof of concept is more about: Can my dev exp be much better without relying on the video streaming approach?

      "I also see the shrinking sentence length celebrated among my scientific colleagues who abhor the dreaded \"run-on sentence\". Maybe it is because I have no formal literacy or linguistic training but I mourn this loss; older, classical novels used to have a tremendous flavor in their sentence structure by prioritizing the longform.

      "This... Actually might be the first AI product I'd ask my work to look into. I've had only one schematic reviewer out of the group catch that a part I'd re-used elsewhere in a design I inherited to reduce complexity + increase configurability actually didn't meet the voltage I needed for it. That example at the start is exactly what was needed and how it was found+fixed. Check the datasheets, check the schematic.Only concern is the datasheet limit. We tend to have bigger designs than that. Also we're not using KiCAD but maybe it could export.reply",
      "So glad to hear that! Regarding the datasheet limit: the current Pro plan caps projects at 40 datasheets, but this is not a hard technical limit. For enterprise customers, we can raise this cap. The primary constraint is inference cost \u2014 once you go beyond ~40 datasheets, meaningful cross-checking can consume Pro-plan usage very quickly. For teams that are less cost-sensitive, a higher-tier plan with increased limits is feasible.On EDA tool support, we can work with any tool that exports a netlist. If you can export to .EDIF, it should work out of the box, as this is the format we accept for Altium designs. The schematic visualizer currently supports KiCad only, but we are exploring how to parse full project files from other tools to provide the same visualization and extract additional metadata.If your team has a formal procurement process, feel free to reach out via the contact email on our site.reply",
      "I may mention it for my next schematic, but they'd probably want to understand the data flow and run everything locally. In that this is a wrapper around the other models (and full credit due, clearly not just a dumb wrapper like an extra prompt at the front of a chat bot), this should be possible, yes? Run the part that queries the models locally, point that to our locally hosted LLMs, and we're good?Otherwise we probably couldn't put many designs of substance in. Just the data security risk.I may reach out from my corporate email tomorrow. It's public who I am and where I work but yes we certainly have a formal procurement process.reply",
      "Fantastic idea.  I've done some PCB stuff in the distant past.  But not recently.I wish I had some examples to test against this.Best of luck going forward.  This is the kind of tool that could make a difference.reply",
      "Looks pretty neat, but you really need to have Cadence (OrCAD or System Capture) format support to scale to larger organizations.  Most larger hardware companies aren't using KiCAD or Altium outside of one-off projects.reply",
      "Thanks for the feedback -- we\u2019re actively looking into this and will keep the HN community updated as we roll out support for more enterprise-focused toolsreply",
      "Can it detect problems in basic schematics consisting of say 5-10 transistors, and perhaps a bunch of resistors and capacitors?Would it be able to detect issues with functionality, and maximum ratings?reply",
      "Yes. I\u2019d recommend trying the free plan with your design to see how it performs. You can also steer the review in a specific direction using custom instructions in \"Advanced Options\" if there are particular parts of the design you want analyzed.reply",
      "I don\u2019t see how you would get a good training set on this or put it in a format that LLMs understandreply",
      "I was puzzled a bit, then realized they only handle schematics. Saying \"PCB schematics\" is weird.A schematic is just a representation of a netlist, something where text is more than fine since the graphical form is only for human consumption. An LLM is actually a pretty good fit to cross-reference datasheets and netlists.Would it be actual PCB layout I would be skeptical as LLMs are quite poor at anything spatial. For schematics however, it could work quite well as a double check.reply"
