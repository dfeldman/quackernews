      "That was a fun read.What really stuck out to me was how R failed in a bunch of other subjects except math because he wasn\u2019t interested in them.I know society and norms expect students to learn all these other subjects.But what if those just aren\u2019t interesting to someone?I wonder how many geniuses we skip on because doing the chores of homework and getting through boring classes is busywork and memorization for the sake of getting an A.Meanwhile, hardly anyone actually remembers anything about those topics and even the best students mostly go on  to achieve only above average things.My class valedictorian went on to become a doctor and while that is certainly impressive to me, there are many doctors and he practices (like almost every other doctor) and isn\u2019t pushing the boundaries of medical science. I feel terrible writing that because I\u2019m certainly not as smart as him, but R is just so impressive and I\u2019m glad he got his lucky break.People like R would be lost in the sea of averages because their genius would be kept shut by norms.Almost every extraordinary person I read about seems like they were 1 step away from being forgotten, and got some huge universal break that boosted them.\n \nreply",
      "IMO, you're thinking about this backwards.It's good that public school exposes children to many subjects - hopefully most of them. So that they can discover if they click with one of them. The real danger is that someone never gets exposed to a subject at all. College is the place to specialize in a subject.\n \nreply",
      "Exposure is good, but success in school requires you to be successful in these subjects as well. I have had similar thoughts recently as OP thinking about what I want for my young kids and what my experiences in school were. Being _really_ good in one thing should allow you to make up for being subpar in other areas, but it doesn't. You can only get an A (or A+) in math for example, even if your a genius. But maybe you should be able to get an A++++ that makes up for D's or F's in English for example and still get accepted into top universities. We need a system that accommodates spiky people better.\n \nreply",
      "> Exposure is good, but success in school requires you to be successful in these subjects as well.Being specific, it's not school, it's what school grants you i.e. a paying job. The higher paying, thusly more coveted jobs, generally filter against good grades which then the requirement pushes downwards into schools because, at scale, it's a decent system; leveraging the schools to help decide who is good.> Being _really_ good in one thing should allow you to make up for being subpar in other areas, but it doesn't.I counter with, if you are \"_really_\" good, it shows because you truly are a genius and you get fast tracked on that subject, but I think your \"_really_\" is actually just \"_pretty_\" and you're trying to include more than the 1 in 100 million.To directly answer your point, for the \"slightly smarter than everyone else\" my middle school allowed kids to attend highschool in specific subjects and then highschool into the nearby community college and considered \"harder/more prestigious\" than the AP programs - admittedly only in math for this latter part. The school was in a more affluent neighborhood so I recognize the privilege.\n \nreply",

      "College is not trade school.  College exists not to generate people who are masters of Framework v3.0, but to generate people who can quickly learn to use whatever tool they're given and who can connect the dots to solve generic problems.  Part of that is exposure to a broad range of ideas.  Part of that is showing that you can learn about and deliver results on things you're not necessarily excited about.\n \nreply",
      "I don't think college teaches people how to learn, and if they do it's only by accident. There's a body of knowledge on how to teach and how to self educate and it takes a long time for systems to incorporate these knowledge.\n \nreply",

Usually command line scrapers and other extensions have predefined sites they work for, this one's outside of those sites2. Or they requires nontrivial configuration and/or code3.

      "It's interesting how mind wandering can be analysed from different perspectives:1. In meditation the main goal is precisely to free ourselves from the monkey mind  that seems to be the cause of all suffering2. In neuroscience mind wandering is seen as the brain default mode unless we are operating within a goal driven mindset3. This can also be seen as a kind of reinforcement learning: we train ourselves to notice when we are mind wandering - this process in itself, after some time, conditions the mind to focus on the present moment4. From a metabolic perspective (e.g. ketogenic therapy), mind wandering can be seen as the result of blood glucose fluctuations that cause mental fogginess and impair focusIn my own experience as a long time meditation practitioner, what really made the difference for me was regulating my blood glucose levels by following a ketogenic diet.

Let's see... the ocean covers 361km^2. If we could engineer a material with \"cells\" that were 1000x as effective at carbon capture as diatoms, and the manufactured material was 1000x more densely packed together than diatoms are on the ocean surface, then you'd need 361 square kilometers of the magic material. Which is not out of the realm of possibility, though I have no idea what the density of diatoms is and I have a sneaking suspicion that we'd be looking at more of the 3x-4x range of efficiency improvement. And of course, you need to turn the CO2 into something and deposit it somewhere, and maybe move it around lot. Which would use energy that would produce more CO2, offsetting the gains. Oh, and manufacture the stuff.I'm thinking releasing less of the stuff and stopping forest destruction might be much more effective for a long time here...\n \nreply",

This is because design stabilization costs additional resistance, less payload and more fuel consumption - for 737 scale it is about 1-3 additional passengers and few percents of range.\nMilitary planes and some aerobatics now are designed unstable for better maneuverability.I don't say, this new trends are good, just notice.\n \nreply",

      "There appears to be a lot of hate towards this in the comments (because it's not perfect?), but I feel strongly that we need explicit bodies of knowledge, along with certifications for having been trained on it.Every company I go to, the base of knowledge of all the engineers is a complete crapshoot. Most of them lack fundamental knowledge about software engineering. And they all lack fundamental knowledge about the processes used to do the work.That's not how engineering should work. If I hire an architect, I shouldn't have to quiz them to find out if they understand Young's Modulus, much less teach them about it on the job. But that's completely normal in software engineering today, because nobody is expected to have already learned a universal body of knowledge.I get this thing isn't perfect. But not being perfect isn't a rational argument for not having one at all. And we certainly need to hold people accountable to have learned it before we give them a job. We need a body of knowledge, it needs to be up to date and relevant, and we need to prove people have actually read it and understood it. If this isn't it, fine, but we still need one.(this is, by the way, kind of the whole fucking point of a trade school and professional licensing... why the fuck we don't have one for software engineers/IT, boggles my fucking mind, if this is supposed to be the future of work)\n \nreply",

      "Credentialism is good. It provides both a trustworthy reference point and a method for punishment.If I want someone to do work, I want them to be licensed/certified. If they are flagrantly unsafe, I want a licensing board or similar to be able to strip that person of their ability to practice that profession. This raises public perception of the profession as a while, avoids a market for lemons, and gives some baseline.There are too many decisions in life to be able to spend an hour (or more) researching every option. Credentials allow a framework of trust - I don't have to decide if I trust every single engineer; if they have passed their PE exam and not had their certification taken away that is a starting point.\n \nreply",
      "Credentialism creates a false basis of trust and an arbitrary reference point.You're just arguing that you want to outsource your own decision making. You actually should interview your candidates before hiring them, whatever credential they have, because it actually is your job to ensure you work with high quality individuals.Credentialism basically allows the sort of low effort that you're describing and causes many places to rely solely on the credentials, which are obviously never sufficient to find high quality individuals.What are the jobs you're day dreaming about that require PE exams?

There's a lot of infrastructure that we take for granted because it always works (water purification and distribution, bridges and roads, electrical generation and transmission, automobile engines, the quality of gasoline, the safety of food, etc). You trust that these things will work the way you expect, because they don't change very quickly. Is that stagnation or stability?\n \nreply",

I assumed rats or corvids would be good candidates for animal language translation projects since you can keep them in a confined space and record video of them. I am sure that body language plays a huge role in animal communication.I recently read a paper[0] that claimed to have decoded the basic building blocks of Sperm whale language. I went and took a look at the github for the project CETI and found that most of the code was for the whale trackers and hydrophones. It seems like there are a lot of pre-requisite problems that you have to solve to even get good whale recordings.On the other hand though, whales probably don't rely on body language since they are communicating way out of line of sight. So it may be easier in that regard.Anyways, I am convinced that we will figure out how to teach some basic human concepts (like self) to animals and the intelligence of even \"stupid\" animals like chickens will make people more reluctant to eat meat.[0] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47221-8#:~:text=S....\n \nreply",

      "To be clear - as of today, many researchers would agree that language is still a uniquely human phenomenon. They discuss this pretty explicitly in the article linked, how it is important to draw a distinction between language and communication. There are no non-human species that have been found to use language for the Chomskian definition of language (using a finite set of symbols to represent an infinite number of communicable meanings).However, this \"dogma\" as you call it is beginning to be weakened as researchers document more nuance and complexity in non-human communication than ever before, and so some researchers begin to say, \"maybe we shouldn't have this all-or-nothing view of language\".

It now seems that most codebases have been decaffeinated though.Civet looks like it adds a little more, but the things that aren't just syntactic sugar are just a grab bag of TC39 proposals. I'm a big fan of language proposals in general, and having a language that adds all of them for research purposes seems like a nice thing to have. Haskell did this well with GHC language options. Is this a research language though? It seems not.What's the benefit over Typescript? A few less characters? Faster TC39 proposal integrations?

(You can also use saboteurs to your advantage if you recognize that they are hunting down and exploiting inefficiencies, but that's a whole other conversation)But my understanding of this case is that the actions do not appear like simple easy to make mistakes. As I understand, the claim was that the intern was modifying the weights of checkpoints for other peoples' training results in an effort to make their own work better. Mucking about in a checkpoint is not a very common thing to do, so should make someone suspicious in the first place. On top of this it appears he was exploiting weaknesses and injecting code to mess with peoples' optimizers, and to do things that do not have a reasonable explanation for.So as far as I can tell, not only was he touching files he shouldn't have been touching (and yes, shouldn't have had access to), he was taking steps to bypass the blocks there were in place and was messing with them in ways that are very difficult to explain away with \"I thought this might be a good idea.\" (Things that explicitly look like a bad idea). If that is what in fact happened, I think it is not a reach to claim intentional sabotage. Because if it wasn't, then the actions are represent such a level of incompetence that they are a huge liability to anyone within reach.[0] https://www.cia.gov/static/5c875f3ec660e092cf893f60b4a288df/...\n \nreply",
      "From what I've seen in Amazon it's pretty consistent that they do not blame the messenger which is what they consider the person who messed up. Usually that person is the last in a long series of decisions that could have prevented the issue, and thus why blame them. That is unless the person is a) acting with malice, b) is repeatedly shown a pattern of willful ignorance. IIRC, when one person took down S3 with a manual command overriding the safeguards the action was not to fire them but to figure out why it was still a manual process without sign off. Say what you will about Amazon culture, the ability to make mistakes or call them out is pretty consistently protected.\n \nreply"
