      "This is so informative, thank you. I always got my kids baby food in glass, thinking it would reduce their microplastics exposure as well as reducing plastic waste. Turns out only one of those was true :(\n \nreply",
      "I am, in a different life, a consumer of compost and I have started looking very carefully at the compost products for sale in the bay area.On the urban consumer side of things I see compost collection bins which cannot possibly be decontaminated of all manner of plastic pieces which will, inevitably, be ground up into the compost product.On the rural side of things I see miles of plastic baling twine and weedeater string - and other plastic meshes and grid - used throughout pastures year after year and then collected back up again with loads of hay and manure which also end up in the compost stream.These truckloads of soil/compost/fill have to be significantly contaminated and the rural end users are pouring them right back on their fields.\n \nreply",
      "Looking forward to more testing like this. I've been trying to consciously avoid anything combining \"hot\" with \"plastic\" though there's only so much you can do.Fish are aggregators of this stuff so that's not surprising. Spam and other processed meats and prepared foods also not too surprising (though what's with the Annie's organic mac and cheese being so full of it? Maybe it's the sauce?)... I think the tap water was the scariest one to me. Sure, you expect some but ... wildly unsafe levels?!\n \nreply",
      "Are you looking at the results in the table on the main page? That is tap water treated with some purifying tablet, not straight tap water. There is plain tap water in the full database but it doesn't seem to have levels of anything in excess of established limits.\n \nreply",
      "My mistake, I didn't see that part. I thought the tablet treatment was just something they did to prepare it for testing. Maybe the tablets kill the microfauna via microplastic overdose.\n \nreply",
      "Manufacturers are putting more and more plastic into things to cut costs it seems.My favorite pour over coffee maker almost entirely had water in contact with metal and glass during brewing.  Glass reservoir, glass decanter, metal grounds basket - only rubber tubes going from reservoir to heating element.When it died (your average coffee maker only lasts 5 years) all of their newer more expensive models had mostly plastic everything except for the decanter.\n \nreply",
      "Hmmm...I'm now worried about my Aeropress, which I love. Perhaps it's time to switch to a french press.\n \nreply",
      "Also, is there an aggregate plastic danger metric? It would be great to develop an aggregate metric that combines the different types of plastics and multiplies them by their known potential dangers to the human body. I realize the multiples will change over time as more research comes in, but right now, there's no way to quantify BPA vs DEHP dangers.This would make the main giant aggregate list: https://www.plasticlist.org\na lot more useful.\n \nreply",
      "The PlasticList site explores safety levels, including a discussion of aggregate levels across products and chemicals. It\u2019s an interesting but frustrating read.\n \nreply",
      "Have \"unsafe levels\" been established, or are we just assuming that any is bad?Edit: I see they appear to be using the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) intake limits for most of their tests.\n \nreply"

      "I would love to, but I come from a place where intellectual pursuits are not valued, so I would lose out on that front if I moved back. I\u2019m the type who needs to always be learning. So I would always need to be in a big city.Alain Bertaud, the urbanist, recently said, \u201cthe big contribution of cities is randomness.\u201d And he continues: \u201cYou don't know what to expect. You don't know who you will meet. And, it's precisely because you meet people who are different from you, who have different ideas. Sometime even it could be obnoxious people. I think obnoxious people \u2014 I mean, what I consider obnoxious \u2014 are necessary in order to stimulate.\u201dIn North America, there is a very strong cultural preference to isolate oneself (probably a residual effect of the frontier spirit). Hence a strong preference for suburban single family homes with backyards (\u201cfor the kids and the dog\u201d) and which results in spread out developments where people rarely have to interact. That\u2019s fine \u2014 but realize that\u2019s a cultural preference.I grew up in a house with no backyard and had an idyllic childhood. I knew my neighbors and biked to the playground. I was as happy as a clam. To this day, I don\u2019t feel any need to own a house with a backyard. That is also a cultural preference.\n \nreply",
      "Having lived in both rural and urban settings, I'm not sure the isolation you describe would be as correlated as you think. People in rural areas still hang out with one another (and even... alot) and people in cities still isolate themselves.To follow that line further, I'd argue that the fact that rural living gives you less choice in company increases the degree to which you invest in the relationships that happen to be around. Consequently, rural living can create a greater sense of intimacy and companionship than the bustle of a city where there's always a new face around the corner (if you get bored of the old faces).\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019m curious, do you live on a farm, or a suburb?\n \nreply",
      "Villages and small towns exist.\n \nreply",
      "I think it\u2019s likely folly to think that the big city is only place where intellectual pursuit and learning can happen.I often tell people that living in a rural area is much like living in the city, but living next to the city is like neither.\n \nreply",
      "It's a simple matter of density. It's not about intellect or intellectual pursuit at large, rural people are plenty smart. It's that intellectual pursuits can be very niche, and you're more likely to find someone that shares that very specific intellectual pursuit the more people there are, in close proximity. If you're located somewhere rural, your closest neighbors maybe 30 mins away, and friends often further. That's a totally different experience compared to having your friends live in the same high rise or be your neighbor 3 mins away. Not saying that one is better than the other, but they're clearly different.\n \nreply",
      "This is it. It\u2019s proximity.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in transformers. In a big city, you could go to a meetup, talk to different people working on this stuff at a production level (maybe there\u2019s even some guy who works on it at Google), talk about tips or pitfalls that no one ever publishes and potentially have the conversation veer off to DuckDB or some obscure topic. When you have a gathering of like minds, the conversation can go in unpredictable directions and you can potentially land in very interesting places.In a less urban area, this is far less likely to happen because there are just fewer people with the same interests (unless you\u2019re lucky). I grew up with friends who were absolutely brilliant (high fluid intelligence) who come from farming families. But they just weren\u2019t interested in what I was interested in. The core of intellectual pursuit isn\u2019t just smart people, but the confluence of people who have the same interests and who are also well positioned.You might ask, can\u2019t you just learn this stuff online and talk to people on Reddit? But the reality is that positive effects of randomness require real life undirected interactions with the right people.(This is for instance why people are willing to relocate to a cold city like Montreal (-30\u00b0C/-22\u00b0F in the winter) to work in Bengio\u2019s lab for a couple of years, just so they can overhear lunchtime conversations about how to train certain models. A lot of this knowledge is caught and not taught.)I\u2019ve gotten so many ideas from just random conversations with well positioned people who happened to be doing something important and interesting. It\u2019s not just about being smart.\n \nreply",
      "> I would love to, but I come from a place where intellectual pursuits are not valued, so I would lose out on that front if I moved back.I used to think along similar lines.  But I haven't found moving out of the city to be subtractive of my 'intellectual life'.  If anything, it has been complementary - due to being grounded in mainstream experience again that I lost touch with in the city.That said, I've very consciously kept those former social connections alive (I'm an hour away), as I still need semi-regular social interaction with people much smarter than me.\n \nreply",
      "> being grounded in mainstream experience again that I lost touch with in the cityI just spent a couple weeks visiting a friend in a (fairly affluent) rural mountain town, and felt this overwhelmingly. Most attention and discussion amongst rural people seems to focus on things that directly affect them and that they can in turn affect. Community projects, social events, improving their schools, local gossip, etc.In contrast, my city friends spend a lot of time on \"bigger\" subjects: wars, geopolitical and economic trends, our predictions on technological development...  also, a lot of conversation about people's travel plans and that sort of thing. Rich city people always seem to be traveling out of the city, or planning their next travel.It's not that the rural people are ignorant of the world, rather, I think it's a conscious choice to focus on things in their sphere of influence. It was a really nice reminder for me. If I ask a city friend \"how have you been doing?\" I'm likely to hear something like \"oh, I've just been so stressed about this election\" or \"I've been worrying about AI taking my job\". A rural friend might say something about digging their neighbor's house out after the latest snowstorm, or start talking about the new ski trail that their community just built.\n \nreply",
      "It depends on how you lived in the city and how much video calling you do outside of work. If you're an hour away, it doesn't make sense to meet a friend in the city for coffee for 30 minutes and then drive home, but if that's not how you interacted with people in the city, then living in the suburbs or rural areas isn't going to change how you interact with them.\n \nreply"

The more I worked with paper, the more I fell in love with its versatility. At some point, I got the idea to make a model of an airplane as a way of challenging myself with an unconventional shape.Though the project began on a much smaller and simpler scale in mid-2008, it has since evolved through multiple revisions to become a highly detailed, true-to-life representation of a Boeing 777. I originally drew my plans by hand, but my desire to increase the accuracy and amount of detail led me to start using Adobe Illustrator to design and print increasingly intricate parts directly onto the folder.The project has been in progress since May 2008I start with as much source material as I can.

The shrapnel field - close to the tail, right side, around 45 degree to the horizontal plane - suggests that the missile was chasing (not say a front attack like BUK in MH-17 case), and explosion happened somewhere behind the right engine at almost the tail distance - which possibly wouldn't damage say a significantly shorter plane like a fighter (or a drone).Googling a bit brings various sources saying that it was Pantsir-S.

      "It\u2019s a fundamental difference between how Airbus and Boeing approach flight controls. Airbus take the view that pilots should never be able to command an action the aircraft thinks is dangerous. Where as Boeing believe that pilots have ultimate authority to command the aircraft to do anything, regardless of if aircraft thinks it\u2019s dangerous (obviously the aircraft provides warning etc, but they can ultimately be overridden and ignored).In a little more detail, Airbus systems take pilot inputs, interprets what the pilot wants to achieve, then commands control surfaces to produce that outcome. Applying limits etc to ensure that flight limits aren\u2019t exceeded. The end result is that pilot inputs are somewhat loosely correlated to control surface outputs, compared to traditional fully mechanical system.Boeing on the other hand tries to as tightly a possible map pilot inputs to control surface outputs, mimicking a pure mechanical system (despite being fly-by-wire, like Airbus). But provides force feedback to the pilot via input controls to indicate, but not completely prevent, that the pilot is approaching or about to exceed flight control limits.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_control_modes\n \nreply",
      "From the NTSB report:2.3.3 Descent and Ditching AirspeedAs noted, the flight crew was not able to initiate part 2 of the Engine Dual Failure checklist, which contained airspeed guidance for pilots to follow if an engine restart is considered impossible and a ditching is anticipated. The checklist states that, when an engine restart is considered impossible, the optimum airspeed at which to fly is the green dot speed.Despite not reaching this portion of the Engine Dual Failure checklist, the captain stated during postaccident interviews that he thought that he had obtained green dot speed immediately after the bird strike, maintained that speed until the airplane was configured for landing, and, after deploying the flaps, maintained a speed \u201csafely above Vls,\u201d which is the lowest selectable\nairspeed providing an appropriate margin to the stall speed. However, FDR data indicated that the airplane was below green dot speed and at Vls or slightly less for most of the descent, and about 15 to 19 knots below Vls during the last 200 feet.The NTSB concludes that the captain\u2019s difficulty maintaining his intended airspeed during the final approach resulted in high AOAs, which contributed to the difficulties in flaring the airplane, the high descent rate at touchdown, and the fuselage damage.

    "first_paragraph": "In aviation, a phugoid or fugoid (/\u02c8fju\u02d0\u0261\u0254\u026ad/ \u24d8) is an aircraft motion in which the vehicle pitches up and climbs, and then pitches down and descends, accompanied by speeding up and slowing down as it goes \"downhill\" and \"uphill\". This is one of the basic flight dynamics modes of an aircraft (others include short period, roll subsidence, dutch roll, and spiral divergence).\nThe phugoid has a nearly constant angle of attack but varying pitch, caused by a repeated exchange of airspeed and altitude. It can be excited by an elevator singlet (a short, sharp deflection followed by a return to the centered position) resulting in a pitch increase with no change in trim from the cruise condition. As speed decays, the nose drops below the horizon. Speed increases, and the nose climbs above the horizon. Periods can vary from under 30 seconds for light aircraft to minutes for larger aircraft. Microlight aircraft typically show a phugoid period of 15\u201325 seconds, and it has been suggested[by whom?] t"

There is an option to install a sandboxed version of the Google play store, with enhanced privacy and security, but you don't need to install this or any other Google services if you don't want to, and I have opted to keep my Graphene installation Google-free.There is a disagreement between the Graphene and CalyxOS community about which is more secure/private: Graphene's sandboxed Google play store, or CalyxOS's MicroG. I've read posts advocating for both sides, but I don't have the expertise to have an opinion, and I decided that I don't want either software on my phone, since I don't want to run google code or play store apps.Although I'm not expert enough to validate the following claims, here's what I've read.Graphene people claim that MicroG needs elevated privileges to run, privileges that Graphene doesn't grant to any app. MicroG also loads and runs Google code (in a context where that Google code would presumably have access to those elevated privileges). Graphene's version of the play store emulates some APIs without using Google code (for privacy), and sandboxes the Google code that it does run, running it with reduced privileges. This is a security first posture, keeping in mind that if you don't have security then you can lose privacy via exploits of your security holes.CalyxOS's MicroG emulates a larger fraction of the google play APIs, making it less reliant on google code to operate, and this is the source of the claim that MicroG offers more privacy.\n \nreply",

A shortcut to the flashlight via power button long press, battery charge limit/smart charging, bandwidth display on the status bar, the option to add more columns to the quick settings, just to name a few.I ended up running crDroid on the Pixel as well, overall it's a decent experience, but not nearly as polished, it turns out I had to manually grant Google Play Services the location permission via ADB so apps would know where I am (missed a train to that one).I'd love it if there was some ROM that combined the security and sandboxing from GrapheneOS with all the neat little features in crDroid... or an actually good Linux phone.\n \nreply",

      "I was trained from the beginning of my career to do this, and trained to teach the same thing to the people reporting to me. It makes us all think harder, empowers lower-level people to make an impact, etc. Recently, though, I had someone convince me that it's not necessarily the best organizational practice.Essentially, there are sometimes big, systemic, intractable problems that lower-level people might see but not have the perspective, experience, etc. to even begin coming up with a solution. Higher-level people might have the perspective and experience but not see those problems (especially as each layer of the hierarchy acts a filter or sugar-coating mechanism for bad news as it moves upwards). If you tell people not to report problems unless they have a solution, and summarily dismiss anyone who does so, some serious problems might just be left rotting.> What am I going to do if I agree with you?A reasonable response to this might actually be, \"I don't know; isn't that why you get paid the big bucks and I don't?\"Reporting problems with proposed solutions should be encouraged, but there shouldn't be a blanket statement of \"Don't bring a me problem unless you have a proposed solution!\" An executive can simply ask, \"Do you have a proposal?\" and if the answer is negative the executive can say, \"I understand, interesting, thanks for reporting this. I'll keep it in mind / assign someone more senior on my staff to look into it / etc.\"\n \nreply",
      "There is a huge spectrum from no proposal at all to a magic bullet on a silver platter. To some extent, the default and implicit proposal is: \"You should something about it!\". Which is markedly worse than \"_We_ should do something about it.\", and worse still than \"Let's do something about it, here's how I can help...\"Some other useful intermediate proposals include:- \"Allow me and my team time to investigate a solution.\"- \"I've organized my complaints into requirements for a solution. Please identify an expert to solve the problem.\"- \"I've socialized these problems with ${people}, I recommend you speak to ${person} about ${topic} for next steps.\"Having said that, I agree that complaints can be counted as \"votes\" for which problems to solve in the future. The problem is that they are not one complaint = one vote. At the very least, the complainer's role and responsibilities need to be accounted for within the scope of the larger organizational goals.\n \nreply",

At least not unless it's spectacularly successful.)\n \nreply",
      "I wonder how the author would respond to your feedback:> Reporting problems and proposed solutions should be encouraged, but there shouldn't be a blanket statement of \"Don't bring a me problem unless you have a proposed solution!\"It's kind of meta because in this post itself you are employing a kind of complain-and-propose.Anyways I think your conclusion is entirely reasonable. I don't think blanket statements are most ever the solution, and I assume the author would agree!\n \nreply",
      "To be clear, in practice I think some organizational cultures just aggressively embrace this idea to the point of it being detrimental. I've heard statements with those exact words coming from executives, and I've seen people sort of squashed by executives in town hall-type forums for raising a problem without offering a solution.(In the line that you quoted, by the way, I just changed \"and\" to \"with\" for clarity.)\n \nreply",
      "It depends on the organization or the team/reporting structure you find yourself in. After a few instances of thinking things out deeply, reporting both the problem and solution, only to have them sincerely acknowledged then never acted upon isn't a great pattern worth repeating. What seems to work better in those situations is to 1. complain, 2. chip away at the problem in the open, 3. socialize suggestions, 4. make small inline changes toward a north star which solves the problem. Basically change the current system to bring the solution closer to the point that someone pulls the trigger and says let's get this done.\n \nreply",
      "> If you tell people not to report problems unless they have a solution, and summarily dismiss anyone who does so, some serious problems might just be left rotting.I would expand on that and say that only bad managers do so. They are paid for exactly that. Manage their people and remove the problems that make their work hard. Sure, if their direct reports come with a proposal already, that is great because they now what direction to go TK make them happy. But if the managers insist on their direct reports to report issues only with solutions, then why do they need the manager in the first place?\n \nreply",

It\u2019s everybody\u2019s right to not want to think.But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that in the vast majority of situations, coming up with a solution is possible. The trick is then to come up with one that\u2019s slightly better and then slightly better and so on until you run into the limit of what you\u2019re capable of.Challenge people to be creative. It\u2019s a skill that can be developed with practice.The next time somebody says they can\u2019t come up with a solution because of their low rank or whatever, try offering them $10k out of your own pocket to come up with any solution.Suddenly, I\u2019ll bet, a solution comes to them!\n \nreply",
      "I mostly agree with you. I suppose we should distinguish between a \"proposal\" and a \"solution.\" I guess a \"solution\" actually satisfies a set of constraints whereas a \"proposal\" could just be dead on arrival because it fails to satisfy one or more constraints. The lower-level person is probably not even aware of all the constraints, so whatever proposal they come up with likely isn't going to be a solution. Demanding that they come up with a throwaway proposal doesn't do a lot of good.Example: The school lunch program is failing to adequately feed students. The first-year teachers stuck with lunch duty see it, the students see it, etc. No doubt that they can come up with some proposal that involves spending more money on the lunch program, and they can even identify some other area to take the money from, but they don't necessarily see the big picture to know why that might not be possible (e.g. tax dollars or grant money can only be spent in certain ways) or what the negative effects might be (e.g. why money is currently being spent in that other area).This is another way I've seen people get squashed by executives. As people were trained to offer a proposal when reporting a problem, they did so, but then it gave the executive an opportunity to just focus on explaining why the proposal can't work instead of just listening and asking follow-up questions to better understand the problem.\n \nreply"
