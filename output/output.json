      "Let's consider strategy. There are two variables: P, the price, and Q, the quantity. Of course by reducing P you increase Q, and vice versa, so besides being dependent on each other, they have an inverse relationship. At some pair, PQ is maximized.Apple knows this. So of course they did not set the price P to maximize Q. They set the price P to maximize PQ.The question should be why P maximizes PQ. I submit that it is because of dopey articles that create a luxury effect around the product. I believe that if necessary, Apple would (and may even already) write and publish these articles themselves.reply",

And the popular tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said it was a \"litmus test\" for fans who \"buy or defend anything Apple releases\".In a press release, Apple said the brightly-coloured accessory was part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake.The late fashion designer previously worked with the tech firm to create the black turtleneck jumpers famously worn by the company's co-founder Steve Jobs.Apple said the product had been inspired by \"a piece of cloth\", and its concep"

It can't be used for just about anything.Unfortunately, I do see the problem with part of this. For a handful of items where it does matter, it will force people to use cards more if they want to avoid rounding. And the card providers already have a choke-hold on retailers, and the whole thing is basically a scheme that funnels money from the poor to the wealthy via interest and fees on the consumer, interchange fees, and rewards programs.reply",
      "I know you're referencing more than pennies, but to speak to pennies, I find the current rounding noise in the US to be weird.  Likely, it's just more of the media, talking heads, and youtube personalities trying to turn a nothing into something, story.Back when we did it in Canada, I don't recall a single person I knew concerned about penny rounding.  Everyone was sick of pennies.  No one cared.  Everyone was happy.  And the math seems fair enough:https://www.budget.canada.ca/2012/themes/theme2-info-eng.htm...Basically, if something is $1.01 or $1.02, you round down.  If it's $1.03 or $1.04, you round up.  Rounding is to be applied after all taxes are paid, etc.Of course, there was also central guidance and, well, everyone just followed it.  It's called \"having a society\".People blathering on about stores fixing the rounding are morons, there's no way to do so if you buy more than one item.  No one gets ripped off with the above method.  In the end, it just works out.And really, who cares?!  It's a penny.reply",
      "As the article points out, there are laws that say people who pay via SNAP debit cards \"cannot be charged more than others\".If cash payments are rounded down, but debit card payments aren't, they are in violation of state law.The article also points out that rollback of pennies in Canada and other places were planned, addressing these kinds of issues.

      "> the stores can adjust the prices to match the expected rounding of pricesNot necessarily. Anything measured by weight will still be subject to this issue.reply",
      "Anything measured by weight is already rounding prices to the nearest cent.  If something is $1/lb and I have 0.995 lbs of it, I get charged $1.00 not 99.5 cents. Presumably just rounding to the nearest 5 cents isn't that different.Of course we don't expect anyone to be charged fractional cents because our currency doesn't support it. So just changing our smallest currency unit from 1 cent to 5 cents.reply",
      "> Presumably just rounding to the nearest 5 cents isn't that differentThe above context was that rounding to 5 cents might be illegal due to laws regarding SNAP debit prices being different than cash prices.reply",

      "Foveated streaming! That's a great idea. Foveated rendering is complicated to implement with current rendering APIs in a way that actually improves performance, but foveated streaming seems like a much easier win that applies to all content automatically. And the dedicated 6 GHz dongle should do a much better job at streaming than typical wifi routers.> Just like any SteamOS device, install your own apps, open a browser, do what you want: It's your PC.It's an ARM Linux PC that presumably gives you root access, in addition to being a VR headset. And it has an SD card slot for storage expansion. Very cool, should be very hackable. Very unlike every other standalone VR headset.> 2160 x 2160 LCD (per eye) 72-144Hz refresh rateRoughly equivalent resolution to Quest 3 and less than Vision Pro. This won't be suitable as a monitor replacement for general desktop use. But the price is hopefully low. I'd love to see a high-end option with higher resolution displays in the future, good enough for monitor replacement.> Monochrome passthroughSo AR is not a focus here, which makes sense. However:> User accessible front expansion port w/ Dual high speed camera interface (8 lanes @ 2.5Gbps MIPI) / PCIe Gen 4 interface (1-lane)Full color AR could be done as an optional expansion pack. And I can imagine people might come up with other fun things to put in there. Mouth tracking?One thing I don't see here is optional tracking pucks for tracking objects or full body tracking. That's something the SteamVR Lighthouse tracking ecosystem had, and the Pico standalone headset also has it.More detail from the LTT video: Apparently it can run Android APKs too? Quest compatibility layer maybe? There's an optional accessory kit that adds a top strap (I'm surprised it isn't standard) and palm straps that enable using the controllers in the style of the Valve Index's \"knuckles\" controllers.reply",
      "> Foveated streaming! That's a great idea.Back when I was in Uni, so late 80s or early 90s, my dad was Project Manager on an Air Force project for a new F-111 flight simulator, when Australia upgraded the avionics on their F-111 fighter/bombers.The sim cockpit had a spherical dome screen and a pair of Silicon Graphics Reality Engines. One of them projected an image across the entire screen at a relatively low resolution. The other projector was on a turret that pan/tilted with the pilot's helmet, and projected a high resolution image but only in a perhaps 1.5m circle directly in from of where the helmet was aimed.It was super fun being the project manager's kid, and getting to \"play with it\" on weekends sometimes. You could see what was happening while wearing the helmet and sitting in the seat if you tried - mostly ny intentionally pointing your eyes in a different direction to your head - but when you were \"flying around\" it was totally believable, and it _looked_ like everything was high resolution. It was also fun watching other people fly it, and being able to see where they were looking, and where they weren't looking and the enemy was speaking up on them.reply",
      "I once lived in a place that had a bathroom with mirrors that faced each other. I think I convinced myself that not only is my attention to detail more concentrated at the center, but that my response time was also fastest there (can anyone confirm that?).So this gets me thinking. What would it feel like to correct for that effect? Could you use the same technique to essentially play the further parts early, so it all comes in at once?Kinda a hair brained idea, I know, but we have the technology, and I'm curious.reply",
      "Foveated streaming is cool. FWIW the Vision Pro does that for their Mac virtual display as well, and it works really well to pump a lot more pixels through.reply",
      "It's the same amount of pixels though, just with reduced bitrate for unfocused regions so you save time in encoding, transmitting, and decoding, essentially reducing latency.For foveated rendering, the amount of rendered pixels are actually reduced.reply",
      "That depends on the specifics of the encode/decode pipeline for the streamed frames. Could be the blurry part actually is lower res and lower bitrate until it's decoded, then upscaled and put together with the high res part. I'm not saying they do that, but it's an option.reply",
      "I think it works really well to pump the same amount of pixels, just focusing them on the more important parts.reply",

      "> Roughly equivalent resolution to Quest 3 and less than Vision Pro. This won't be suitable as a monitor replacement for general desktop use. But the price is hopefully low.Question, what is the criteria for deciding this to be the case? Could you not just move your face closer to the virtual screen to see finer details?reply",
      "There's no precise criteria but the usual measure is ppd (pixels per degree) and it needs to be high enough such that detailed content (such as text) displayed at a reasonable size is clearly legible without eye strain.> \"Could you not just move your face closer to the virtual screen to see finer details?\"Sure, but then you have the problem of, say, using an IMAX screen as your computer monitor. The level of head motion required to consume screen content (i.e., a ton of large head movements) would make the device very uncomfortable quite quickly.The Vision Pro has about ~35ppd and generally people seems to think it hits the bar for monitor replacement. Meta Quest 3 has ~25ppd and generally people seem to think it does not. The Steam Frame is specs-wise much closer to Quest 3 than Vision Pro.There are some software things you can do to increase legibility of details like text, but ultimately you do need physical pixels.reply"

DevTools has always felt unintuitive/unfamiliar coming from an IDE, so just bringing the IDE UX and vim keybindings over is already a big improvement. It also makes LLM prompting feel better contextualized.As an aside, thinking back to learning React seven or eight years ago by watching a bunch of tutorial videos where they'd switch between IDE and browser views or awkward split screens, this seems like a way better format for explainers/walkthroughs of frontend code.reply"

      "I daily drive FreeBSD on my desktop with KDE. It is not as smooth as Linux and requires a little more tinkering compared to Linux. But I love it!The killer features for me:- The pf firewall. Rules you actually understand!- Jails! When you cannot have Zones this will do.- Native ZFS. Stable, mature, safe and with all the features you can dream of.- Linuxulator. Binary compatibility with Linux if need be. Can be put in jail as well.- pkg/ports. I really like it but I might have been indoctrinated.- Networking stack. Good. Stable. Makes sense to me.For a nice graphical UI Linux is more smooth but if you are willing to tinker it can work. As Linux gets all the attention you will see stuff such as Chromium lag behind.I can understand that can scare people off. But FreeBSD feels like a comfortable old glove for me. I will suffer the minor holes. My beard has grayed and my hair line is non-existant.If waiting for a laptop I would perhaps wait for FreeBSD 15 for much needed improvements in WIFI. If you want fast WIFI today you need weird hacks routing through a Linux VM[1]. It works rather well but it is honestly a bit clunky.[1] https://github.com/pgj/freebsd-wifiboxreply",

When I say random, I mean after a kernel update or the wind changes direction.  I think wifies lappy is OK now because I seem to get a lot less \"support\" calls for the last few weeks.To be fair, there are a lot of moving parts from a lot of bits of Linux involved in a modern distro these days.When I say hard to decide what solved looks like: if Samba or SSSD crap out, is that wifi's fault or the kernel/driver?  This is exactly what Windows has had to solve over the years and I do note things like credential managers and mounts that manage to survive disconnects being bolted on to Linux.All that scrappy stuff needs to be passed on to the BSDs too.

      "But look, it almost looks as if the Static Huffman (a simpler encoding of compression with fewer decoding errors) almost bears out a certain aspect of the friend's intuition, in the following way:* only 4.4% of the random data disassembles.* only 4.0% of the random data decodes as Static Huffman.BUT:* 1.2% of the data decompresses and disassembles.Relative to the 4.0% decompression, 1.2% is 30%.In other words, 30% of successfully decompressed material also disassembles.That's something that could benefit from an explanation.Why is that, evidently, the conditional probability of a good disassemble, given a successful Static Huffman expansion, much higher than the probability of a disassemble from random data?reply",
      "There's an important number that's missing here, which is how many of the 128 bytes were consumed in that test.With 40 million \"success\" and 570 \"end of stream\", I think that implies that out of a billion tests it read all 128 bytes less than a thousand times.As a rough estimate off the static huffman tables, each symbol gives you about an 80% chance of outputting a byte, 18% chance of crashing, 1% chance of repeating some bytes, and 1% chance of ending decompression.  As it gets longer the odds tilt a few percent more toward repeating instead of crashing.  But on average it's going to use quite few of the 128 bytes of input, outputting them in a slightly shuffled way plus some repetitions.reply",
      "In common anecdotal experience with disassembling code, it is very common for data areas interspersed with code (like string literals) to disaassemble to instructions, momentarily causing the human to be puzzled: what is this repetition of five \"or\" instructions doing here referencing registers that would never be arguments?The reason is that the opcode encoding is very dense, and has no redundancy against detecting bad encodings, and usually no relationship to neighboring words.By that I mean that some four byte chunk (say) treated as an opcode word is treated that way regardless of what came before or what comes after. If it looks like an opcode with a four-byte immediate operand, then the disassembly will pull in that operand (which can be any bit combination) and skip another four bytes. Nothing in the operand will indicate \"this is a bad instruction overall\".reply",

A friend claimed that the random stream is more likely to contain DEFLATE-compressed Thumb instructions than it is to contain uncompressed Thumb instructions.1 I disagreed.The gist of his argument was that random bytes have high Shannon Entropy in expectation, and compressed bytes have higher entropy than raw assembled instructions. Thus, compressed streams of assembled instructions will be more likely to occur than raw assembled instructions in sequences of random bytes. I don\u2019t debate the premise, but the conclusion does not follow.I argued that the joint probability of random bytes being a valid DEFLATE stream\u2014and that stream inflating to valid instructions\u2014is lower than the probability of random bytes being valid instructions.

Most people I know are not installing too many casks, and most of the ones I've seen install signed binaries anyway. The important thing for me with this is that it doesnt appear to impact homebrew's ability to download, compile, and install open source software. And that is the main thing I use homebrew for.

I don't remember which programs it is, exactly, but I do use a few that are unsigned.It also doesn't seem to me that the signing process is as vital in determining actual risk as the curation and moderation processes involved in maintaining \"third-party\" software distributions like Homebrew or Debian or whatever.`--no-quarantine` in particular is one of the conveniences that makes Homebrew casks useful.

      "To understand the significance of artificial skin, first consider all sorts of bad things that happen after deep burn. The dead tissue in a burn wound can release toxins and provide nutrients for bacteria to grow, which in turn can spread toxins and infection throughout the body, eventually causing multiple organ failure and death. Early treatment of deep burns focuses on interrupting this cascade reaction by removing the dead tissue. The now-cleaned wound needs to be covered. Skin from many species, including chicken, rat, pigeon, cat, dog, frog, cow, and pig, has been tested, and pig skin was found to be the best. As the wound's condition improves, healthy skin from the same patient is grafted or seeded onto the wound to assist healing. Although pig skin is still widely used, the biggest problem is that it is from a different species and therefore can be immune rejected. Gene-edited pig skin helps, but it may still require immunosuppressive therapy, which is not helpful when the patient is at high risk of infection.Artificial skin has the potential for better temporary wound cover, and ideally, it can promote healing without skin grafting or using less skin for grafting.reply",

      "Fun story. I worked at a large food tech company. For products like Yoghurt you\u2019d like Bactria that make the yogurt very quickly at high temp. But grow as slowly as possible at low temp (stays fresh longer).They\u2019d mutate the s out of these Bacteria, in smart calculated ways. A basepair here, a gene there. When they hit a jack pot. They\u2019d document the mutations, throw the engineered strain out and start blasting them with UV. Afterwards you just scan for the same mutations and voila, now it\u2019s classical strain enhancement!Same was done for yeast for all kinds of food applications.There is something to be said for it because you never need antibiotic resistance for selection that way. But you also don\u2019t really know what you are doing and you could edit the resistance genes out. Anyway, this was >20 years ago. Maybe they do it differently now.reply",
      "Wow. My mind is truly blown.For anyone else wondering, I learned that in order to naturally create bacteria that aren\u2019t going to be labelled GMO, you can blast regular bacteria with UV, then look for the ones with the same mutations as the engineered ones (with desirable traits), and now you can legally use the \u201cnatural\u201d bacteria in Non-GMO labelled products.Putting my personal views (from a consumption pov) on this topic aside, that is some clever \u201cengineering\u201d.reply",
      "There are a bunch of tricks like this. So for instance to make antibiotic-free chicken without a commitment to being antibiotic-free and organic, raise a bunch of chickens, take any who gets sick enough to need antibiotics and put them into a separate field with their antibiotics, sell the ones that happen to not get sick as antibiotic-free, sell the other ones as usual.Or, if you're making orange juice, make the ingredients label say oranges. But you can split it up, take the peels, put them into a hydraulic press, extract out oils that have the concentrated aroma and flavor of oranges, homogenize some of that into the juice. Or you can centrifuge the juice, or you can pass it through osmotic filters to remove some of the water and concentrate the flavor. No rule saying you can't treat some of the juice similar to sugar beet juice and try to isolate its sugars. At the end, you reassemble a perfect consistent mixture. The label doesn't have to tell you about any of this, it just has to tell you that the ingredients were oranges.(The recipe for the best lemonade you'll ever make is like this, it's just lemons and water and sugar, but you zest the lemons into the simple syrup you're making with the sugar water, then strain it with cheesecloth or a coffee filter, before adding to the juice and water and pulp.)Imported oils, you can basically do anything that some middleman country allows you to do with the oil (in particular mix with cheaper oils) and then say \"oh this is imported olive oil, olive oil according to someone else's standards\u201d...reply",

      "I was a tube amp tech for several years, have built multiple guitar amps from scratch, and still dabble in it.What may not be obvious is that modern tube amp designs are an evolutionary branch from 1930's technology, with only a little coming across from the transistor->digital tech tree.  The amps of the 40s and 50s were pretty closely based on reference designs that came from RCA and other tube manufacturers.Modern passive components (resistors, diodes and caps) are made to a far higher tolerance and are better understood, but tubes and transformers are a mixed bag.  The older designs were somewhat overbuilt and can be more reliable or have tonal characteristics that are not available in modern parts.reply",

I have since built perhaps a dozen hi-fi stereo and mono-block tube amplifiers\u2014some from kits, some from scratch. I've built a handful of guitar amps as well (even sold some as kits for a bit).

      "That's a cute little article.The key diagram is the one that shows the signal path through the amplifier. Input feeds grid, plate feeds next grid, final output is from plate. Everything else is supporting circuitry.Note that between each stage there's a capacitor in the signal path. That's to block DC. If you want an amp that amplifies DC, each stage has to run at a higher voltage than the previous stage. The plate must be above the grid in voltage.\nThis was a huge headache in tube computers, both analog and digital.Transistor circuits don't have the increasing voltage problem. Outputs and inputs are in the same voltage range. That's because transistors are current gain devices, not voltage gain devices.reply",

In particular normal people usually don't realize how crappy their wi-fi and assume it's all the same, which would end in blaming the poor perf on the headset.reply",
      "Reminds me of Apple's AWDL, a similar workaround for crappy networks when the devices need a high speed low latency network.  I do wonder if the headset here will do similar channel hoping tricks to join both the dongle's network and the normal wifi network.reply",
      "At this point, the controller is the most exciting thing for me.Steam machine is cool, but with how good handheld PCs already are, I'd be ok spending a bit more and just using those instead and docking it for TV gaming.reply",
      "Their previous generation controller wasn't great (I have one). I got it on sale and the haptive stuff didn't work to well IMO.I have a 8bitdo controller and they are really good. They work perfectly with Debian 13 and probably pretty much every other distro.https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3-mode-controller-xbox/reply",
      "I have six of the previous generation controller and I love them, only minor annoyance is pairing them occasionally.  I don't really use the haptics part all that much thoughreply",
      "The non-handheld will likely be pricier than the handheld, due to the beefier specs. You may as well just buy one now.reply",
      "idk about that - integrated buttons, battery, screen, size constraints and the R&D work that goes into all of that is probably significant compared to 'box with hardware and usb ports' (oversimplifying to make a point here though - of course lots of design work went into this as well).reply",
      "2160x2160 in each eye for the headsetreply",
      "110 deg fov is a bit on the low side but I guess it'll have to do. I hate how 90% of VR headsets are designed to feel like you have binoculars strapped to your face, absolutely zero peripheral vision.reply",
      "One of the reasons I put off getting corrective lenses for a long time and kept trying to use contacts despite how horrible they make my eyeballs feel, is that I have an extremely wide peripheral vision. I can see my fingers wiggle behind the plane defined by my shoulders, I will react to motion out there.Having my FoV dumbed down to 90\u00ba sounds like hell, especially in a game where we are looking for opponents.Playing Doom on a widescreen monitor with the FoV modifications made it a lot less annoying. I want that even more today.reply"
