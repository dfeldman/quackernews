      "> Secretary Rejects Emergency Antibiotics Ban in Animal Feed\nHealth and Human ServicesSecretary Margaret M. Heckler on Wednesday refused to impose an emergency ban on the use of antibiotics in animal feed. Mrs. Heckler denied a petition filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which had sought to shorten the process by asking the secretary to declare an 'imminent hazard' to public health. Declaring an 'imminent hazard' would invoke emergency powers and allow an immediate ban. The NRDC contended that routine, low-level use of antibiotics in animal feed is allowing drug-resistant bacteria to enter the human food chain, weakening the ability of drugs to fight human disease. The NRDC sought a ban on the use of small amounts of penicillin and tetracycline. Mrs. Heckler's decision does not end the matter permanently, as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) still can ban antibiotics in animal feed through administrative regulations. The issue of antibiotics in animal feed has already been under review at the FDA for more than eight yearsAntibiotic resistance predicted all that time backreply",

      "> For example, on Oct 7, 1985, Palestinian hijackers took over the cruise ship Achille Lauro. Reading this on a delay in 2025, the story unfolded over weeks: first they threw an American in a wheelchair overboard, then US fighter jets forced the escape plane to land, leading to a military standoff between US Navy SEALs and the Italian Air Force. Unbelievably, the US backed down, but the later diplomatic fallout led the Italian Prime Minister to resign.From the perspective of 2025, I can't help but think about the people I know today getting vocally angry about Israeli violence in the Gaza strip, and suggesting that this violence has implications for US politics - and I wonder how many of those people would be happy to throw an American in a wheelchair off a ship in the name of the Palestinian cause.Reading the wikipedia article about this incident, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achille_Lauro_hijacking , it seems like the hijackers murdered the guy in a wheelchair before they threw his body off the ship, and it's possible but unproven that they picked him in particular either because he was Jewish or because he was in a wheelchair. The hijackers involved were given long prison sentences, but many of them were released decades ago and have fought against US in other ways since then.I mostly think of the Israel/Palestine conflict as one that I have no dog in - I'm not Jewish, Israeli, or Palestinian myself and have no ties to the region. Nonetheless, pro-Palestine political messaging is something that happens around me all the time today, and knowing that the conflict was happening 40 years ago and that some of the same things that were happening then are akin to what is happening now colors my opinion of what is happening now.reply",

So you have people who make excuses for Hamas like \"they are just responding to an existential threat\" while strongly condemning Israel, and people who make similar excuses for Israel while strongly condemning Hamas. Personally I feel that there are no heroes and everyone sucks in this situation, except for the innocent bystanders on both sides who are being caught in the crossfire.reply"

In contrast, this guide refers to GL0 being the \"standard XNU kernel context\" even though XNU lives in EL2 on macOS. Furthermore, on device OSes (iOS/iPadOS/etc) they put a second kernel in GL1 and various enforcement policy tools (i.e. code signing policy, camera indicator policy) in GL0[0].

If you don\u2019t mind your data being used for advertising purposes, Chrome is an excellent browser and their broader ecosystem gives you functionality Mozilla will never match.Mozilla\u2019s only way out is to go back to its roots and build a better user-agent, and provide an adversarial alternative to the current advertising-based ecosystems.reply",
      "> demonstrated by their ever-shrinking browser market shareAt this point I think Firefox market share stopped being in Mozilla's hand.Just as it was during the browser war days, the critical issue went back to site compatibility: Firefox performs poorly on Google properties (Gmail is fine, YouTube, gsuite, admin consoles are pretty bad), and document based services like Notion or Figma. It kinda works, but Chrome based browser perform notably better.The main point of course is that those sites are at fault (sometimea intentionally when it comes to Google), but that doesn't change Mozilla's position. Stop using Google services is just not a great choice, and many of us use them rely heavily on them for work.Mozilla could make technical miracles and or bring some incredible feature from the left field, but that's a tall order for any company that size, so I'd expect most of their future effort to still end up with lower market share, whether or not they had good ideas.reply",

Yes, google did some shady stuff but in parallel Firefox was also slow for everything.Only when FF Quantum launched the performance caught up, and the same launch gave power user a push to go elsewhere, coz all their plugins either stopped working or worked worse.And it was too little too late too. IIRC the FF market share was already hovering around 10%.

      "Before anybody gets too excited, it's better to understand what exactly happened.China ran an experimental reactor that achieved some conversion of thorium into uranium. More precisely, the conversion ratio was 0.1 [1]. This means that for each new fissile atom generated from thorium (i.e. uranium-233) 10 atoms have been burned from the original fissile inventory.Now, conversion happens in every nuclear reactor. Some new fissile material (generally Pu-239) is generated out of \"fertile material\" (generally U-238). And, surprisingly, that conversion ratio is quite high: 0.6 for pressurized light water reactors and 0.8 for pressurized heavy water reactors [2].What China has achieved therefore is well below what is business as usual in regular reactors. The only novelty is that the breeding used thorium, rather than uranium.Is this useless? No, it is not. In principle increasing the conversion ratio from 0.1 to something higher than 1.0 should be doable. But then, going from 0.8 in heavy water reactors to more than 1.0 should be even easier. Why don't people do it already? Because the investment needed to do all the research is quite significant, and the profits that can be derived from that are quite uncertain and overall the risk adjusted return on investment is not justified. If you are a state, you can ignore that. If China continues the research in thorium breeding, and eventually an economically profitable thorium breeder reactor comes out of that, the entire world will benefit.

However, I suspect you might hit an issue here where such a low conversion rate would make the reactor go sub-critical.reply",

Those who were given smartphones at an earlier age were associated with worse mental health outcomes for every year of smartphone ownership before the age of 13.Early smartphone ownership was associated with feelings of lower self-image and lower self-worth in both girls and boys. Girls reported lower emotional resilience and lower confidence, while boys reported feeling less calm, less stable and less empathetic.\"The younge"

      "I've started a company in this space about 2 years ago. We are doing fine. What we've learned so far is that a lot of these techniques are simply optimisations to tackle some deficiency in LLMs that is a problem \"today\". These are not going to be problems tomorrow because the technology will shift. As it happened many time in the span of the last 2 years.So yah, cool, caching all of that... but give it a couple of months and a better technique will come out - or more capable models.Many years ago when disc encryption on AWS was not an option, my team and I had to spend 3 months to come up with a way to encrypt the discs and do so well because at the time there was no standard way. It was very difficult as that required pushing encrypted images (as far as I remember). Soon after we started, AWS introduced standard disc encryption that you can turn on by clicking a button. We wasted 3 months for nothing. We should have waited!What I've learned from this is that often times it is better to do absolutely nothing.reply",
      "This is the most important observation. I'm getting so many workshop invitations from my corporate colleagues about AI and agents. What most people don't get that these clever patterns they \"invented\" will be obsolete next week. This nice company blog about agents - one which got viral recently - will be obsolete next month. It's hard to swallow for my colleagues that in these age - like when you studied gang of four or a software architecture pattern book that you have learned a common language - no, these days the half-life of a pattern for AI is about a week. Even when you ask 10 professionals what an agent actually is - you will get 10 different answers yet they assume that how they use it is the common understanding.reply",
      "This is also why it's perfectly fine to wait out this AI hype and see what sticks afterward. It probably won't cost too much time to catch up, because at that point everyone who knows what they're doing only learned that a month or two ago anyway.reply",
      "Counterpoint to these two posts: a journeyman used to have to make his own tools. He could easily have bought them, or his master could have made them. Making your own tools gives you vastly greater skills when using the tools. So I know how fast AI agents and model APIs are evolving, but I\u2019m writing them anyway. Every break in my career has been someone telling me it\u2019s impossible and then me doing it anyway. If you use an agent framework, you really have no idea how artificially constrained you. You\u2019re so constrained, and yet you are oblivious to it.On the \u201cwasting three months\u201d remark (GP), if it\u2019s a key value proposition, just do it. Don\u2019t wait. If it\u2019s not a key value prop, then don\u2019t do it at all. Often times what I\u2019ve built has been better tailored to our product than what AWS built.reply",

      "Note that even many of those \"long knowledge\" things people learned are today obsolete, but people that follow them just haven't figured it out yet. See how many of those object oriented design patters just look very silly the minute you use immutable data structures, and have access to functional programming constructs in your language. And nowadays most do. Many seminal books on how to program in the early 2000s, especially those covering \"pure\" OO, look quite silly today.reply",
      "Vehement disagree. We implemented our own context editing features 4 months back. Claude released a very similar featureset we had all along last month. We were still glad we did it because \n(A) it took me half a day to do that work\n(B) our solution is still more powerful for our use case \n(C) our solution works on other models as well.It all comes down to trying to predict what will be your vendors' roadmap (or if youre savvy, get a peek into it) and whether the feature you want to create is fundamental to your applications behavior (I doubt encryption is unless youre a storage company).reply",
