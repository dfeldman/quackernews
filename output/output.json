      "One of my Core Memories when it comes to science, science education, and education in general was in my high school physics class, where we had to do an experiment to determine the gravitational acceleration of Earth. This was done via the following mechanism: Roll a ball off of a standard classroom table. Use a 1990s wristwatch's stopwatch mechanism to start the clock when the ball rolls of the table. Stop the stopwatch when the ball hits the floor.Anyone who has ever had a wristwatch of similar tech should know how hard it is to get anything like precision out of those things. It's a millimeter sized button with a millimeter depth of press and could easily need half a second of jabbing at it to get it to trigger. It's for measuring your mile times in minutes, not fractions of a second fall times.Naturally, our data was total, utter crap. Any sensible analysis would have error bars that, if you treat the problem linearly, would have put 0 and negative numbers within our error bars. I dutifully crunched the numbers and determined that the gravitational constant was something like 6.8m/s^2 and turned it in.Naturally, I got a failing grade, because that's not particularly close, and no matter how many times you are solemnly assured otherwise, you are never graded on whether you did your best and honestly report what you observe. From grade school on, you are graded on whether or not the grading authority likes the results you got. You might hope that there comes some point in your career where that stops being the case, but as near as I can tell, it literally never does. Right on up to professorships, this is how science really works.The lesson is taught early and often. It often sort of baffles me when other people are baffled at how often this happens in science, because it more-or-less always happens. Science proceeds despite this, not because of it.(But jerf, my teacher... Yes, you had a wonderful teacher who didn't only give you an A for the equivalent but called you out in class for your honesty and I dunno, flunked everyone who claimed they got the supposed \"correct\" answer to three significant digits because that was impossible. There are a few shining lights in the field and I would never dream of denying that. Now tell me how that idealism worked for you going forward the next several years.)\n \nreply",
      "This is, more or less, exactly what happened when I took Electronics I in college.The course was structured in such a way that you could not move on to the next lab assignment until you completed the one before it. You could complete the lab assignments at your own pace. If you failed the lab, you failed the class, regardless of your grade.The second or third lab had us characterize the response of a transistor in a DIP-8 package, which was provided to us. If you blew it up, you got a slap on the wrist. That DIP-8 was otherwise yours for the class.I could _never_ get anything resembling linear output out of my transistor. The lab tech was unhelpful, insisting that it must be something with how I had it wired, encouraging me to re-draw my schematic, check my wires, and so on. It could _never_ be the equipment's fault.Eight (!) weeks into that ten week class, I found the problem: the DIP was not, in fact, just a transistor. It was a 555 timer that had somehow been mixed in with the transistors.I went and showed the lab technician. He gave me another one. At this point, I had two weeks to complete eight weeks of lab work, which was borderline impossible. So I made an appointment to see the professor, and his suggestion to me was to drop the class and take it again. Which, of course, would've affected my graduation date.I chose to take a horrible but passing grade in the lab, finished the class with a C- (which was unusual for me), and went on to pretend that the whole thing never happened.\n \nreply",
      "That is enraging.  I've seen similar things happen too and it blows my mind how ridiculous some of these teachers can be.  I don't know if it's dehumanization of their students in their minds or an utter unwillingness to devote 30 seconds of directed attention to understanding the situation and making a reasonable judgment, but whatever the cause it is prolific.  The only thing worse is when one of them will add something like, \"life isn't fair, get over it\" when it's fully in their power to make a reasonable determination.\n \nreply",
      "The flip side of this is from the professor's perspective: some undergrad in every class will lie their ass off about why their assignment was delayed.Unfortunately, this reality produces no good options if you think someone is telling the truth: (1) make an exception, and be unfair to the rest of the class or (2) don't make an exception, and perpetuate unfairness for the impacted student.\n \nreply",
      "That's fair, but in this case it should be pretty easy to verify if the person is lying.  The claim is highly reproducible and the instructor wouldn't even have to do it.\n \nreply",
      "Unfairness to the class, if kept under wraps, is a case of no one actually being harmed.\n \nreply",
      "It's a general problem with large bureaucracies. If you're a cog in the machine, the safest way is to always stick to the rules, and avoid any situation where one has to exercise discretion, since any personal judgment comes with potential personal responsibility down the line.\n \nreply",

I believe it's now fortunately mandatory in newer DOCSIS CPEs (but I have a lot of faith in CPE manufacturers to somehow still botch it).[1] In fact, negligible packet loss for reasons other than congestion is a critical assumption for at most older TCP congestion control algorithms!\n \nreply"

      "The 32b sounds like it has some useful small tweakers. Tweaks to make output more human friendly, better mathematical reasoning, better fine-grained understanding. https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl-32b/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464068Qwen2.5-VL-72b was released two months ago (to little fanfare in submissions, i think, but some very enthusiastic comments such as rabid enthusiasm for handwriting recognition) already very interesting. Its actually one of the releases that kind of turned me on to AI, that broke through some of my skepticism & grumpiness. There's pretty good release notes detailing capabilities here; well done blog post. https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/One thing that really piqued my interest was Qwen HTML output, where it can provide bounding boxes in HTML format for its output. That really closes the loop interestingly to me, makes the output something I can imagine quickly building useful visual feedback around, or using the structured data from easily. I can't imagine an easier to use output format.\n \nreply",
      "I suppose none of these models can output bounding box coordinates for extracted text? That seems to be a big advantage of traditional OCR over LLMs.For applications I'm interested in, until we can get to 95+% accuracy, it will require human double-checking / corrections, which seems unfeasible w/o bounding boxes to quickly check for errors.\n \nreply",
      "qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct seems perfectly happy outputting bounding boxes in my testing.There's also a paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12191 where they explicitly say some of their training included bounding boxes and coordinates.\n \nreply",

      "If you're limited to open source models, that's very true. But for larger models and depending on your document needs, we're definitely seeing very high accuracy (95%-99%) for direct to json extraction (no markdown in between step) with our solution at https://doctly.ai.\n \nreply",
      "In addition, gemini Pro 2.5 does really well with bounding boxes, but yeah not open source :(\n \nreply",
      "Actually qwen 2.5 is trained to provide bounding boxes\n \nreply",
      "I'd guess that it wouldn't be a huge effort to fine tune them to produce bounding boxes.I haven't done it with OCR tasks, but I have fine tuned other models to produce them instead of merely producing descriptive text. I'm not sure if there are datasets for this already, but creating one shouldn't be very difficult.\n \nreply",

This task, which likely required a great deal of manual labor and technical knowledge, was key to making the system work effectively and sustainably.This kind of thing is cool as a passion project, but it really just highlights how efficient the modern supply chain is.

But it takes a lot of time to research, acquire skills, get tools and build.> you could just buy for $20kI agree with a broader point but that particular price is extremely high and far from reality.A reasonably good 18650 cell has a capacity of ~12 Wh (~3300 mAh * ~3.7 V = ~12.2 Wh). The battery mentioned in the article consists of \"more than 1000\" such cells. Let us assume 1200 cells. That would mean it has a capacity of ~14.4 kWh (1200 * 12).It is possible to get a pre-assembled steel battery case on heavy-duty wheels for 16 LiFePo cells, with a modern BMS with Bluetooth and wired communication options, a touchscreen display, a circuit breaker and nice terminals for ~ $500. And it is also possible to get 16 high quality LiFePo cells with a capacity of ~300 Ah each, like EVE MB31, for significantly less than $100 each. This means that for less than ~$2000, it is possible to get all components required to assemble a fully working ~15 kWh LiFePo battery.- That assembly would take a few hours rather than weeks.- It will have new cells rather than used ones.- It will be safer to use than a battery with Li-Ion cells.- It will likely take much less space.- It will be easy to expand.\n \nreply",

There were also a few areas where a location could have used an additional clickable area but had to make do without.  Also to fit on 3 disks about half the nodes were left out: generally when walking a straight path every other node was left out for both disk space and also time-consuming-rotoscope reasons.\n \nreply",

If you only ever play one version, that's the one to play. GOG maintains a beautiful version of this (that works well even on modern Windows), but Cyan de-listed it from GOG a while back, so you can't technically buy fresh copies anymore.Don't mistake this for \"Real Myst: Masterpiece Edition\", which is (sorry Cyan), not very good. They imported the old assets into Unity for the re-release, and then did some random texture/asset swaps, the lighting and mood didn't survive the import and is all randomly weird -- strongly recommend ignoring this one.The original release is good if you want the original experience - https://www.gog.com/en/game/myst_masterpiece_editionAnd the new Myst (2021/VR, Unreal Engine) release is wonderful and beautiful, but is more of a re-make to modern gaming sensibilities.\n \nreply",
      "> Don't mistake this for \"Real Myst: Masterpiece Edition\", which is (sorry Cyan), not very good.I know you link it further down, but there are two Masterpiece Editions, one for Myst (1999) and one for realMyst (2014).  The one you link is the MPE of Myst, and technically not the original 1993 game, though as far as I can tell, it's just an upgrade of graphics and sound, whilst remaining faithful to the original.I couldn't get realMyst to work back when I got it on GOG, so I'll admit I haven't tried it (nor its Masterpiece Edition), but I did enjoy the 2021 remake, although I noticed that even though it had been over a decade, I sped through that game (I mention this, because I actually visited it after having played the 2024 Riven remake, where the changes to the puzzles did stump me from time to time).  Though, personally, I am more of a Riven fan.\n \nreply",
      "Since we're getting pretty far down the nerding-out-on-myst rabbit hole: the original version of realMyst, at least for Windows, had some bug that would cause it to immediately crash on any system with a multi-core CPU. At some point someone released a patched EXE that fixed it, I have no idea if gog and/or Steam ever released an official patched version.Also, while talking about remakes: Riven got a remake last year, and it's fantastic. The sprit of the game is entirely intact, but they made changes to some puzzles that both make the experience fresh (for anyone that played the 90s version of Riven) and much less annoying (for any first time players). Can't recommend the Riven remake enough.\n \nreply",
      "Conceding that it was a technical necessity, the replacement of live actors for in-game CGI rendered characters feels off in the Riven remake to me.  Necessary because now you can walk all the way around them, the game can't assume a single viewing angle for videos to play out.  Nor would it be practical to record new actors playing the roles (the old assets must surely be too low-quality to pass in a modern game, even if they go back to the source).Part of Myst and Riven's charm in the 1990s was the immersion it offered, the world felt real, and the actors playing out characters added to it.  The original point-and-click format feels dated today, but at the time, it was convincing enough to be believable.\n \nreply"

      "That's a great point! Unfortunately Topological Sort generates a linear order, forcing nodes to run one after another.

This produces a linear batches.  {C D E F}, {parentA parentB}, {root} \n\nWithin a batch, nodes can run parallel.  Between batches, they still need to run one after another.What you're asking for is to partition the dependency graph according to node dependency with minimum span.  { {C D} parentA } \\\n  { {E F} parentB } - {root}\n\nOr with a shared dependence.  { {C D S} parentA } \\\n  { {E F S} parentB } - {root}\n\nAnd on top of that, add node weight into the consideration.  That's hard.For now, you can send notification to a dependent when the leading task finishes.  E.g. When C finishes, notifies parentA.  When D finishes, notifies parentA.  When parentA notices that all its leading tasks have done, it can start.The library can help in maintaining the dependency relationship and let the task query its leaders and dependents.\n \nreply",

      "I see a lot of people angry at \"Nue\" in various ways, and I can't help but think these are people heavily relying on React and missing the overall issue. The issue is that these huge frameworks have made the web a horrible slow mess. I deal as DevOps/SRE daily with these services, and finding one that will do a first load under 10s is close to impossible. When a simple home page dashboard or a notes page takes more than 10s to load on a 10G connection peered within 5ms of the host, and 95% of this is spent in JS, that's when you know the typical current webapp has reached a massive state of bloat only supported by fast browser engine, and people not having expectations.I'm not hopefully Nue would revolutionize this since there are plethora of Web SaaS companies just wanting to use \"common\" frameworks...  but I can at least root for them.\n \nreply",

Two full-featured apps built with minimal prod dependencies. There's a pretty good chance that the various ShadCN modules share many of their dependencies so that importing more doesn't necessarily mean a linear increase in bundle size. It could be that once you build something full-featured, React projects come in smaller, or at least not big enough to invalidate the other upsides of choosing it.\n \nreply",
      "But the OP did implement a fully featured app as the Nue comparison half of the benchmark. I have never used Nue and don't know if I ever would. I just think to be fair to the OP, even if incremental cost declines as you keep adding stuff in React, there's no way it is negative, which means the benchmark you asked for logically must have a similar result?\n \nreply",

      "In high school, we had a Netware 3.12 environment, and the Guest account was enabled, albeit with very limited privileges. But for some reason, Guest could still use NET SEND, which popped up a little message in the bottom row of the destination machine's display.The whole district shared a T1 connection to the internet. Which was more than plenty for email, but as this world-wide-web thing started gaining traction, it became quite the bottleneck. And as some of us had discovered mp3 files, the slowness simply would not do.One day there was some severe weather and a power hiccup during school hours, and every station got a message from ADMIN informing us that the server room was running on UPS power and we should save our files and log out immediately.Hmmmm.A few weeks later, one of the bright sparks in the technology program realized that having everyone log off would free up some bandwidth. So he logged onto the next machine over as GUEST, and used a NET SEND ALL \"SERVER ROOM POWER FAILURE - 11 MIN OF BATTERY REMAIN - SAVE FILES AND LOG OFF\" and sure enough, within about a minute, the whole T1 was his. Did what he needed to do (i.e. leeching an entire fserv) for about 8 minutes, then NET SEND ALL \"POWER RESTORED - RESUME YOUR WORK\".A few weeks later some hot commodity had just dropped and he repeated the drill. It still worked.Nobody noticed that these messages came from GUEST, even the district administrator, who eventually called an electrical contractor to figure out why the power in the server room was so flaky. Someone eventually pointed it out to him, which got a very red-faced \"that's really clever but please knock it off\", and no further punishment.

(But maybe there was some integration between the two after my experience with Netware, who knows.)I mainly wanted to say, as someone who used/abused a Netware network in high school, I disassembled the SEND program and discovered that the username included in the message is not authenticated at all -- the IPX (or NETX, I forget which) software interrupt just took a string, and the SEND executable formatted the username into this string. So by crafting your own SEND program that used the software interrupt directly, you could easily forge any username you wanted.
