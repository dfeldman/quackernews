      "For the non-Brits, \"sixth-form\" means years 12 and 13 of school - equivalent to junior and senior years of high school in the US. The first and second yearsof sixth form are referred to as \"lower sixth\" and \"upper sixth\" respectively.It's a hold-over term from when secondary education (ages 11 and up) started in \"first form\" and worked up.\n \nreply",

      "I've wanted this for ages, Laptop ergonomics are horrible. When traveling I use a portable monitor, keyboard, mouse. Yes it's annoying to travel with all that but worth it not to end my work days with neck pain and a migraine.I need a somewhat powerful GPU for work, so I'm seriously considering buying one of the more powerful handhelds with removable controllers and just taking them off. The screen would be superfluous  but it's probably the most powerful travel PC, at least for the price, that's available right now.I don't even need the battery that much. But all the options I've seen for SFF PCs they would fit in a backpack look fragile and I wouldn't feel confident carrying them around often. Plus, they're either expensive (because it's a tiny market) or geared towards office work.On the other hand, the Mac Mini exists and is exactly what I'd want in terms of hardware. Why don't us Linux/Windows folks have this option?\n \nreply",
      "For gaming, I'd also rather have the Steam Brick, I think. You have a large company with strong interest in the drivers for built-in hardware and external controllers all working smoothly.

      "No, the steps 1 vs 2+3 refer to different things, they do not depend on each other. They start with the distillation process (which is probably easier because it just requires synthetic data).

Congrats on your achievement! If someone  does dive into fully characterizing the undocumented instruction so it can be properly supported in emulators (as you suggested), please post about it on HN. I suspect, like many undocumented CPU instructions, it was probably to help the original designers test or verify something during development but it would be interesting to know.While obviously a subjective judgement, a lot of people who hand coded assembler on 68k processors regard the ISA as especially elegant, powerful and fun to develop for. In many ways I think of it as peak CISC, thanks to its orthogonal instruction set and wildly flexible addressing modes. And of course the platforms which used it are legendary, from consumer (Mac/Lisa, Amiga, Atari ST, Sinclair QL) to workstations (SUN, Apollo, Quantel) to gaming (Sega Genesis, Neo Geo, Capcom, Atari, Namco, Sega, Taito, Konami) to embedded (automation, print/network controllers, synthesizers, appliances).

      "Immutability is a fantastic tool, especially when working with enterprise data. It's relatively easy to implement your own temporal tables on most existing databases, no special libraries or tools required. It seems really trivial/obvious, but I'll admit I first stumbled into the concept using the AS400 at work. If you make a mistake on payroll in IBM's old MAPICS program, you don't overwrite or delete it. You introduce a new \"backout record\" to nullify it, then (maybe) insert another record with the correct data. It seems obvious once you've seen the pattern.I've made a few non-technical eyes go wide by explaining A) that this is done and B) how it is done. The non-tech crypto/blockchain enthusiasts I've met get really excited when they learn you can make a set of data immutable without blockchain / merkle trees. Actually, explaining that is a good way to introduce the concept of a merkle tree / distributed ledger, and why \"blockchain\" is specifically for systems without a central authority.(Bi)Temporal and immutable tables are especially useful for things like HR, PTO, employee clock activity, etc. Helps keep things auditable and correct.\n \nreply",
      "Without specific support from the RDBMS, bitemporal schemas are difficult with regard to cross-table references, such as foreign keys. Rows that need to be consistent between tables aren\u2019t necessarily 1:1 anymore, but instead each row in one table needs to be consistent with all corresponding rows in the other table having an intersecting time interval. You then run into problems with transaction isolation and visibility.\n \nreply",
      "> It's relatively easy to implement your own temporal tables on most existing databasesIt gets tricky when you need to change the schema without breaking historical data or queries. SQL databases could do a lot more to make immutability easier and widespread.\n \nreply",
      "One fundamental issue I\u2019ve noticed is that typical SQL databases have a single schema per table defining both the logical and physical aspects, typically with a strong correlation between the two.Databases could treat the columns as the fundamental unit with tables being not much more than a view of a bunch of columns that can change over both space (partitioning) and time (history).\n \nreply",
      "Editors and form validation are where this gets tricky. The user isn't just reporting new, independent observations to append to a log. They're looking at existing state and deciding how to react to it. Sometimes avoiding constraint violations with other state that they're not looking at is also important.It often works out, but if you're not looking at the right version then you're risking a merge conflict.\n \nreply",
      "I love the quote \"accountants don't use erasers\". So many things should be modeled over time and keep track of change right out the gate. Little things like Ruby on Rails always adding timestamps to model tables was super helpful but also a little code smell. If this is obvious enough to be useful everywhere, what is the next level? One more reason Datamoic is so cool: nothing is overwritten, it is overlayed with a newer record and you can always look back and you can always also always take a slice of the db at a specific time and have a complete and consistent viewbof the universe at that time.

      "The recommended approach is to generate SQL that looks like:    SELECT \\* FROM users\n    WHERE id = $1\n        AND ($2 IS NULL OR username = $2)\n        AND ($3 IS NULL OR age > $3)\n        AND ($4 IS NULL OR age < $4)\n\n\nIt's worth noting that this approach has significant dangers for execution performance--it creates a significant chance that you'll get a query plan that doesn't match your actual query.

      "Agree.  With patterns like this you are leaning on your db server\u2019s CPU - among your most scarce resources - versus doing this work on the client on a relatively cheap app server.  At query time your app server knows if $2 or $3 or $4 is null and can elide those query args.  Feels bad to use a fast language like Rust on your app servers and then your perf still sucks because your single DB server is asked to contemplate all possibilities on queries like this instead of doing such simple work on your plentiful and cheap app servers.\n \nreply",
      "> WHERE id = $1>It's worth noting that this approach has significant dangers for execution performanceThis extra WHERE id=$1 clause makes it behave different from the slow examples you cited from the Markus Winand blog.  The query planner should notice that id column is a selective index with high cardinality (and may even be the unique ids primary key).  The query optimizer can filter on id to return a single row before the dynamic NULL checks of $2,$3,$4 to avoid a full-table scan.The crucial difference is the id clause doesn't have an extra \"OR id IS NULL\" or \"$1 IS NULL\" -- like the blog examples.\n \nreply",
      "Note that null is being used here in the \u201cunknown value\u201d sense in order to combine several possible queries into one query plan.  Which is a bad idea for a query you need to be performant:  $1 can be null (which is possible in the original stackoverflow question that this blog post is a reaction to), and if the parameters are passed in via a bound argument in a prepared statement (not uncommon), then the query plan won't necessarily be taking the passed parameters into account when deciding on the plan.\n \nreply",
      "You are right. If that\u2019s the query you need to write, you\u2019ll be ok.That said, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had occasion to write a query quite like that.

There are quite a few of these now - Chisel (which Spinal forked from long ago), Amaranth (Python), and Clash (Haskell) all come to mind.\n \nreply",

      "We do a fair bit of FPGA design in SpinalHDL, and have taped out several ASICs with parts of the design done in SpinalHDL at my dayjob.In general: No, alternative HDLs don't see a lot of use, and I'd argue that we qualify as 'academia' since the ASICs are NIH funded and we tend to work with a lot of academic partners and on low-quantity R&D projects.Having said that, every time we've deployed SpinalHDL for a commercial client they've been blown away by the results.  The standard library, developer ergonomics, test capabilities, and little things like having clock domains as a part of the type system make development so much faster and less error prone that the NRE for doing it in verilog just doesn't make sense.You get access to the entire Java and Scala ecosystem at elaboration and test time.  We deploy ScalaCheck in our test harnesses to automatically generate test cases that can reduce inputs to identify edge cases.  It's incredibly powerful.\n \nreply",

At low volume, the semiconductor unit cost is mostly irrelevant so you can potentially use things like SpinalHDL to keep engineering hours down, and therefore potentially save NRE, and eat the higher unit cost which occur due to toolchain inefficiencies.At high volume NRE is mostly irrelevant and unit cost is everything.  So even if a tool or language is hard and annoying to use, if it gives a lower unit cost, you use it.   Here you see things like an engineers hand tuning the layout of a single MUX to eek out a bit more of something good in the PPA space.I only have experience with high volume HW and there something like Chisel or SpinalHDL wouldn't be considered as it just adds complexity to the flow, and makes it hard to do the optimizations that high volume enable us to consider, for a potential benefit we're not interested in.\n \nreply",

What's that annual probability? 1%.So if you knew NOTHING else, from a bayesian standpoint, if you have to differentiate a once in a 100 year spillover or a lab leak, you would put it at 50/50.Now add in the fact that the outbreak occurred right next to a BSL lab.  Now add in the fact that this lab specialized in the exact type of virus that caused the pandemic.  Now add in the fact that lab workers at that lab got hospitalized with respiratory symtpoms in November.  Now add in the fact that China responded with tons of secrecy, pulled down their genomic database of known viruses in their Wuhan lab, Xi issued a proclamation in February that they were revamping safety at BSL labs to prevent leaks, and that the virus in question is remarkably similar to one they found in 2013 thousands of miles away, and add the fact that there was a proposal to modify cornaviruses via the furan cleavage site to perform gain og function research, and this virus emerged remarkably well adapted to humans very very quickly. Now how about the fact that China pushed the wet market theory even after they'd  figured out that probably wasn't the case?How does that affect your truth value?  All the facts above  push the probalistic truth value toward a lab leak.  There are a few facts that push it back a little the other way, but there aren't very many that I've found.\n \nreply",
      "If something very like smallpox, thought eradicated, suddenly showed up in some random town, it might be surmised that maybe some animal reservoir for it somehow slipped through the gaps.  But if that random town happened to be Atlanta, home of the CDC, known to have some of the few samples of smallpox to still exist, then the relative chance of a lab leak must be thought higher.  That's basic Bayesian reasoning.  It doesn't prove anything but pretending the proximity to a relevant lab doesn't shift the odds at all is absurd.\n \nreply",
      "Actually, it's more difficult to prove a wild origin than a lab origin, because labs have papertrails and witnesses.I never said I was right. I said it makes a lot of sense and I believe it's probably true.This is the sort of thing that neither of us can prove to the other at this point. You seem awfully aggressive to prove something though.\n \nreply",
      ">because labs have papertrails and witnessesIf you have access to the labs. Second hand information and extremely delayed visits to labs in a one party state are a whole other matter.",
      "> That\u2019s like saying that if a new flu came out of Atlanta, the fact the CDC is there proves it came from a lab, and must be true because someone\u2019s janitor cousin who worked there one summer said it was true.Well in this case it\u2019s more like if if a new flu burst onto the scene with the following all being true:- the epicenter of the outbreak being within a few miles of the CDC- the CDC working specifically on gain of function for new strains of the flu- the CDC being cited in whistleblower reports to the outbreak for poor safety and security protocols in the years prior to the outbreak- inability to find the natural reservoir the virus crossed over from, despite years of searching in the biggest virus hunt in human history- the closest naturally occurring relative of the virus being found in bats that are only native in areas hundreds of miles away (in this analogy, something like the upper Midwest), that also happen to be among the species of bats being studied by the lab at the CDC- several CDC employees being among the earliest discovered cases, so early that they occurred before the disease was even picked up in the radar and were only discovered when searching for the earliest cases- the US government preventing any none government health officials in or out of the area of the infection for several weeks after the outbreak- the sole other identified potential outbreak location, the wet market nearby, was completely sterilized by the US government within the first  two weeks of the outbreak, over the protests of international investigators who hadn\u2019t yet been given access to it, thereby preventing them from ever being able to confirm or deny if it was the actual ground zero of the outbreak.\u201cLow confidence\u201d doesn\u2019t mean there is a lack of evidence, it means there is a lack of direct evidence. Problem is there is a lack of direct evidence for any alternative theory as well. There is, however, and overwhelming about of circumstantial evidence supporting the lab leak. The CIA isn\u2019t going to issue accusations like this  without a smoking bullet, which they will never have.The reality is that had this occurred under any other administration, the lab leak hypothesis wouldn\u2019t be so taboo. But Trump is a serial conspiracy theorist and pugilistic nationalist, so the second he floated it everyone on the left, which includes much in academia, immediately disputed it in a knee jerk reaction, despite not having much evidence either way. Since then what evidence exists has increasingly supported the lab leak theory, but many are walking back from entrenched positions. If this had happened when Obama was president I don\u2019t think anyone would be pushing back on this with the evidence that exists.\n \nreply",
      "there's a 19 bp sequence CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG that is directly lifted from the moderna hiv vaccine patent (which preceded covid-19 by a decade).\nnow an exact match of that length isn't impossible, but which is more likely? that this managed to be exactly correct on accident? or some grad student was told to just copypasta every furin cleavage site in the database into a GOF library and surprise surprise the most virulent form that became a pandemic came from the sequence that is engineered to be efficient.any scientist that has any molecular biology wet experience will tell you this is exactly what they would have done (though us researchers would probably not have pulled from the patented BLAST sequences, since that selector is turned off by default by the NCBI)\n \nreply"

      "One of the things I like about this paper is the pristine, crystal-clear English it uses to describe things I thought I knew extremely well:> Processes are the software analog of processors. They are the units of software modularity, service, failure and repair. The operating system kernel running in each processor provides multiple processes, each with a one gigabyte virtual address space. Processes in a processor may share memory, but for fault containment, and to allow processes to migrate to other processors for load balancing, sharing of data among processes is frowned upon. Rather, processes communicate via messages. They only share code segments.\"Processes are the software analog of processors.\" Yes of course. How easy it is to never ponder such a thing.\n \nreply",
