      "Another resource on the same topic: https://blogs.gnome.org/rbultje/2017/07/14/writing-x86-simd-...As I'm seeing in the comments here, the usefulness of handwritten SIMD ranges from \"totally unclear\" to \"mission critical\". I'm seeing a lot on the \"totally unclear\" side, but not as much on the \"mission critical\", so I'll talk a bit about that.FFmpeg is a pretty clear use case because of how often it is used, but I think it is easier to quantify the impact of handwriting SIMD with something like dav1d, the universal production AV1 video decoder.dav1d is used pretty much everywhere, from major browsers to the Android operating system (superseding libgav1). A massive element of dav1d's success is its incredible speed, which is largely due to how much of the codebase is handwritten SIMD.While I think it is a good thing that languages like Zig have built-in SIMD support, there are some use cases where it becomes necessary to do things by hand because even a potential performance delta is important to investigate. There are lines of code in dav1d that will be run trillions of times in a single day, and they need to be as fast as possible. The difference between handwritten & compiler-generated SIMD can be up to 50% in some cases, so it is important.I happen to be somewhat involved in similar use cases, where things I write will run a lot of times. To make sure these skills stay alive, resources like the FFmpeg school of assembly language are pretty important, in my opinion.\n \nreply",
      "So on point. We do _a lot_ of hand written SIMD on the other side (encoders) as well for similar reasons. In addition on the encoder side it's often necessary to \"structure\" the problem so you can perform things like early elimination of loops, and especially loads. Compilers simply can not generate autovectorized code that does those kinds of things.\n \nreply",

Human readable assembly language is, as the name suggests, assembled into binary data, known as machine code, that the CPU can understand. You might see assembly language code referred to as \u201cassembly\u201d or \u201casm\u201d for short.The vast majority of assembly code in FFmpeg is what's known as SIMD, Single Instruction Multiple Dat"

      "> Do interaction nets have any interesting properties that make them useful for distributed computing?Of course, the intrinsic parallelism is useful there (especially since it is emergent from the structure of the program, rather than needing to be explicitly written). In terms of other interesting properties: interaction nets don't rely on linear memory, instead being based on a graph, which can naturally be chunked and distributed across machines, with synchronization only being necessary when wires span different chunks.> And synchronization primitives?The initial answer to this question is: interaction nets don't need synchronization primitives, as all parallelism is emergent from the net structure.Now, in practice, one may want some additional synchronization-esque primitives. For example, a parallel shortcircuiting or is not expressible in vanilla interaction nets (as all computation is deterministic, and such an operation isn't deterministic). There are extensions to interaction nets for non-determinism, that allow some of these use-cases, which start to look more like synchronization primitives. Vine doesn't support any of these at the moment, but it may in the future.> I wanted to also say I loved reading the documentation. Your idea of places, spaces and values feels like a waaay more intuitive naming scheme for than what's common in CS.I'm glad to hear it!

I sometimes buy physical books with the intention of keeping them for when I'm in the mood to read them, sometimes this might be months or even years. But with a digital book delivered with a licence I've always got a niggle in the back of my mind thinking about a digital collection dissappearing or the service becoming obsolete.

This disclosure is a small step in the right direction, but I don't think it's enough yet.Any words like \"Buy\", \"Purchase\", \"Own\", etc should be absolutely banned. They should be forced to to use verbs like \"Rent\". Saying you're purchasing a license is better than saying you're purchasing the book, but if it's not a perpetual license, they should be required to specify the duration (or, if indefinite but revocable, it should be so stated).Things like:- \"Rent for 1 week\"- \"$2.99 to borrow for a month\"- \"Rent for as long as we decide to allow\"I also think if the marketing materials explicitly disagree with the terms within a clickwrap license agreement, the marketing materials should be binding.\n \nreply"

      "This is probably just nostalgia, as I was the right age to sink hours into the golden age of Ultima IV-VII when I was younger, but I still think these are the best roleplaying games ever made, and by an absolutely gigantic mile. Every time I try a new RPG, I initially have this feeling like, will this be like Ultima, will this be like Ultima, but I always end up disappointed.The best way of describing what makes them so great is that they avoid everything feeling like one of those fake-cardboard-cutout Western movie sets. Every other RPG I've played feels like this, the infinity engine games like Baldur's Gate (I've only played 1, not 2) being the canonical example. Everytime I run into an NPC or situation in Baldur's Gate it just feels like the characters start talking through a script that was written just for me, the player, to setup some problem for I, the player, to solve. This is of course the very definition of immersion breaking, because this artificial setup draws attention to the fact that you're playing a game, you're not actually in a real believable world. Baldur's Gate has fantastic combat (an area Ultima VII is terrible), but I think the way that the story is setup and told is boring and uninspired. And that goes similar for literally every other RPGs I've played: Mass Effect (\"Hi I'm an alien from a new race you've never met, would you like me to tell you everything about how my race fits into the universe?\"), Skyrim (Besthesda, masters of the anonymous, faceless NPC), the Witcher/Cyberpunk (the CD Projekt Red games are actually masters of this style of game design, because they use it as scaffolding for easily the best writing ever in video games, but they're still hampered by inherent weakness of the format: That the world feels like a prop to setup quests for the player to knock down).In contrast, the Ultima games feel like they create the world first, so that feels alive and believable. And I don't mean by writing a bunch of lore (writing has it's format already, books, use game mechanics to tell your story), but I mean by creating a world piece by piece, character by character, city block by city block, room by room, each piece of furniture, individual dresser by individual dresser. Environmental story telling, game mechanic story telling, storytelling native to the format of of games. The tavern goes here, the barber lives here, these three friends meet at this pub, at this time every day, and discuss this. Ultima does this for every town and every character in the game, for even the most trivial NPC. There's no anonymous, faceless, story-less NPCs acting as walking props like in every other RPG. And once that world feels like a real believable place, one that you could just sit and watch at have it be interesting, like people watching through cafe window--existing through an intersection of mechanics (how NPCs move, day-night-cycles, how they interact with the environment, e.g., the classic \"using flour to bake bread\"). Only then are the player-driven interactions then built on top of this world, e.g., if you hear a rumor that the shopkeeper seems to disappear for a couple of hours after their shop closes each night, well you can wait till 5 PM and follow them and see what they're up to. Since everything is scripted to this degree, it doesn't feel like you've entered into a pre-programmed scenario for following just this one NPC, you can follow anyone in the game this way, it just so happens that some NPCs might do something interesting after you follow them, like maybe you see them hide a key under a plant and you can go investigate.This way of having the player-driven gameplay come directly from mechanics that existed first to make a believable world, just makes for more interesting games in my opinion than anything that has come after. A game that's just a series of scripted encounters for the player to knock down is just less interesting.\n \nreply",

      "A video I watched not too long ago expressed something similar as \"in some RPGs, society exists for you\" (e.g. you, a random escaped prisoner, can just waltz up to the local lord in Skyrim and be taken at face value). \"In others, you exist in a society\" (and the guards will keep you from even entering the nobles' district unless you're in good standing, which takes a considerable amount of the game to get).It's not quite the same thing, because that example is about how other people treat you, not whether they've got lives of their own; but in a broader perspective, it's still about how much the game seems to be a prop for the player's enjoyment vs. being a proper world that doesn't fall apart five days after the player wins.\n \nreply",

      "Neat. I maintain a blog myself[1] and prefer reading content written by actual human beings, not corporate shills or spammers masquerading on Medium and Dev.to.But I feel like the whole indie web thing hasn\u2019t taken off because of discoverability issues. RSS and Atom are nice, but they aren\u2019t mainstream enough. Also, adding support for them is difficult for non-technical or even semi-technical people.My blog does support RSS, and I use a reader to keep tabs on people I find interesting. But personally, I\u2019m not a great fan of the protocol itself. It\u2019s old, written in XML. There is JSON RSS, but that\u2019s not widely supported and is fragmented as hell. Also, most RSS readers are just firehose feeds and don\u2019t offer much in terms of organization.I\u2019m yet to find a solution for this that I genuinely like.[1]: https://rednafi.com/\n \nreply",
      "Are we really abandoning established, stable protocols because we don't like the serialisation format they use? The practical difference here between XML and JSON is negligible, the value here comes from the ecosystem (which is extensive on the  RSS/atom side, and non-existent on the other). As a user, you'll never interact with the XML. As a developer, if you're interacting with the XML rather than using one of the many, MANY, libraries, you're doing something wrong.\n \nreply",
      "Not saying we need to abandon it, but I\u2019m not a big fan of RSS itself.Yes, there\u2019s an ecosystem, but it\u2019s neither extensive nor mainstream. Feed readers are hit or miss, and I haven\u2019t found one I like. Subscribing to 50 people is enough to make the feed unusable since there\u2019s little to no organization.While this isn\u2019t entirely the protocol\u2019s fault, its poor state is largely due to its lack of mainstream adoption\u2014too few people care about it. The protocol itself might also be part of the problem.So discoverability is still a problem because not enough people care about the existing solutions.\n \nreply",

      "Exactly this, but with some automatic content grouping. Also, the ability to read the whole content in the reader instead of having to go to the site. But that depends on how RSS/Atom exposes the content; this is why I am not a big fan of the protocol. Too much fragmentation: RSS, RSS2, Atom.\n \nreply",
      "I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'automatic content grouping'. Are you talking about somehow automatically grouping the posts from disparate sites into buckets based on some criteria?

I don't think I've used a feed reader that didn't understand all current flavors of RSS and Atom, so it makes absolutely no difference what the webmaster decided to use, my news reader can figure it out.It is a little bit annoying when the webmaster doesn't put the full text of the article in the news feed, and instead wants you to actually visit their site to read their stuff. I'd guess that they do that to make sure that you actually visit the site once in a while and might accidentally view an ad so they can make a few cents or they hope that you might see something else on their site you might be interested in or whatever. It also saves some bandwidth by not downloading the full text of an article if it turns out that I wasn't interested in it.\n \nreply",

But that depends on how RSS/Atom exposes the content;It rather depends on the amount of content the RSS _author_ includes in the RSS feed. There's nothing in the RSS/Atom protocol that prevents you from reading the entire article, but some website creators decide to truncate the feed content.My RSS reader of choice, InoReader, has the option to download the original website which solves the problem.

      "For those who want to have a substantive discussion on the federal budget and believe these cuts are justified, I have a few questions (putting aside questions of constitutionality for this thread):1. There are claims that federal spending is out of control. How do you square that with the fact that spending as a percentage of GDP is only slightly elevated compared to the historical average going back to at least the 1970s, with the main deviation in the past few years coming from the after-effects of the pandemic? [1]2. Federal spending largely falls into a few categories: taking care of the elderly (36%), defense and veterans (20%), taking care of the poor or disabled (22%), and interest on existing debt (13%). [2] This adds up to 91% of the budget. The US population is aging, which means that 36% slice is going to naturally grow. What do you think should be cut, and how?3. The US pays far more for health care (28% of the budget if you include Medicare) and with worse outcomes on average. Why shouldn't the health insurance industry be the first item on the chopping block?4. Corporate tax receipts have been steadily falling as a percentage of GDP. [3] Why shouldn't corporations (that benefit from a healthy and educated workforce, a safe and secure environment, a working transportation system, etc.) be paying their fair share to keep the national debt in check?[1] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYONGDA188S[2] https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/feder...[3] https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1DUdb\n \nreply",
      "> How do you square that with the fact that spending as a percentage of GDP is only slightly elevated compared to the historical average...?Why should it scale linearly with GDP? I can see an argument that it should scale linearly with population (maybe), but if GDP per capita increases, you could also expect better tech/productivity to allow gov spending per capita to decrease.> What do you think should be cut, and how?Given the complexity in the details, I don't think a 'serious discussion' about this is even possible in this forum. But if the question is 'do you think an effort should be made to look for things to cut', I'd say 'yes, of course.'> Why shouldn't the health insurance industry be the first item on the chopping block?Absolutely, it should be looked at! I don't think it's a trivial problem to solve, but as RFK was confirmed as the secretary of HHS we should expect a lot of scrutiny on big pharma and insurers.> Why shouldn't corporations .. be paying their fair share to keep the national debt in check?By definition of 'fair', they should. But again, tax receipts falling as a % of GDP isn't evidence that they're not.\n \nreply",
      "It scales linearly because the same ratio of services to people continues. There aren\u2019t suddenly less kids to educate, less elderly that need health care or less cases in federal court as the population grows.\u2014-\nAs someone that has been in healthcare for 12 years it\u2019s broken because of the corporate structure and administrative state of companies. The payors and providers share the same incentive to raise rates because they each collect a percentage of premiums. This is a solved problem in every OCED country in the world except here. RFK isn\u2019t going to fix this, he hasn\u2019t even labeled the problem correctly. He has some ok ideas around nutrition but the rest of his ideas range from futile to dangerous.\u2014- \nCorporate tax contributions aren\u2019t at fair levels the national debt is increasing even while spending isn\u2019t. They get access to markets created by society and government and yet as debts increase their ratio of tax payments is going down. The fair level would cover social service costs. I haven\u2019t even gotten to the companies that receive subsidies or pay workers so little that they are in social support.\n \nreply",
      "> It scales linearly because the same ratio of services to people continuesThat would be scaling with population, not GDP.> The payors and providers share the same incentive to raise rates because they each collect a percentage of premiumsThis must be an oversimplification. Why would insurers ever reject a claim, or spend time negotiating lower rates, if they're only incentivized to see health costs increase?\n \nreply",
      "No, because the level of services and cost to provide them scales also.Inflation.  What paying workers costs.  What is considered an \u201cacceptable\u201d level of poverty vs abject poverty as we get richer.  New, expensive medical procedures.  And as the world gets richer, defense gets more expensive.We can\u2019t pay 1930 salaries to workers, field a 1930s army, nor would we consider it humane for our elderly to end up with an impoverished 1930s standard of living with 1930s medical care.Inflation is misleading for these purposes, too, because it includes hedonic adjustments.Re: insurers\u2014 it is an oversimplification. Suffice it to say they are at scale where they have market power and thus don\u2019t price where mr=mc, and the regulatory pressures and price opacity push them further away from efficiency.  They are not completely insulated from costs or market pressures, but it\u2019s fairly close.\n \nreply",
      "> Why should it scale linearly with GDP? IGDP per se, maybe not, however we should still expect it to scale with the costs of services and goods that are correlated.Ex: If the dollar price of rent doubles, then dollar expenditures to keep the elderly from dying in ditches will likewise double, even with no change in population.\n \nreply",
      "GDP increases are generally measured in real (i.e. inflation adjusted) terms, so a doubling of rent costs don't imply a larger GDP. If we're talking nominal GDP, then I'd agree we should expect gov expense to increase as well.\n \nreply",
      "> Why should it scale linearly with GDP?It doesn't have to. But GDP is a good proxy for the tax base. If the problem is deficits and spending isn't increasing linearly with GDP, that suggests the problem is with taxation. Not spending.\n \nreply",
      "Another factor is cost of debt. In a decreasing interest rate environment it's possible to run with increasing deficits without any major issues, but once you bounce off zero, even if thos deficits are not currently a problem, projections show that they will be.\n \nreply"

      "The confidence seems to be an artifact of fine tuning.   The first instruction trained models were given data sets with answers to questions but generally omitted non answers to things the model didn't know.Later research showed that models know that they don't know certain pieces of information, but the fine tuning constraint of providing answers did not give them the ability to express that they didn't know.Asking the model questions against known information can produce a correct/incorrect map detailing a sample of facts that the model knows and does not know.  Fine tuning a model to say \"I don't know\" in response to the those questions where it was incorrect can allow it to generalise the concept to its internal concept of unknown.It is good to keep in mind that the models we have been playing with are just the first ones to appear.   GPT 3.5 is like the Atari 2600.  You can get it provide a limited experience for what you want and its cool that you can do it at all, but it is fundamentally limited and far from an ideal solution.   I see the current proliferation of models to be like the Cambrian explosion of early 8 bit home computers. Exciting and interesting technology which can be used for real world purposes, but you still have to operate with the knowledge of the limitations forefront in your mind and tailor tasks to allow them to perform the bits they are good at.  I have no-idea of the timeframe,  but there is plenty more to come.  There have been a lot of advances revealed in papers.  A huge number of those advances have not yet coalesced into shipping models.   When models cost millions to train you want to be using a set of enhancements that play nicely together.  Some features will be mutually exclusive.  By the time you have analysed the options to find an optimal combination, a whole lot of new papers will be suggesting more options.We have not yet got the thing for AI that Unix was for computers.  We are just  now exposing people to the problems that drives the need to create such a thing.\n \nreply",
