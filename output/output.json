      "A neat little thing I like about Zig is one of the options for installing it is via PyPI like this: https://pypi.org/project/ziglang/  pip install ziglang\n\nWhich means you don't even have to install it separately to try it out via uvx. If you have uv installed already try this:  cd /tmp\n  echo '#include <stdio.h>                     \n  \n  int main() {\n      printf(\"Hello, World!\");\n      return 0;\n  }' > hello.c\n\n  uvx --from ziglang python-zig cc /tmp/hello.c\n  ./a.outreply",
      "That's really cool actually. Now that AI is a little more commonly available for developer tooling I feel like its easier than ever to learn any programming language since you can braindrain the model.reply",
      "The standard models are pretty bad a zig right now since the language is so new and changes so fast. The entire language spec is available in one html file though so you can have a little better success feeding that for context.reply",
      "I totally vibe with the intro but then the rest of the article goes on to be a showcase bits of zig.I feel what is missing is how each feature is so cool compared to other languages.As a language nerd zig syntax is just so cool. It doesn\u2019t feel the need to adhere to any conventions and seems to solve the problems in the most direct and simple way.An example of this declaring a label and referring to a label. By moving the colon to either end it makes labels instantly understood which form it is.And then there is the runtime promises such as no hidden control flow. There are no magical @decorators or destructors. Instead we have explicit control flow like defer.Finally there is comptime. No need to learn another macro syntax. It\u2019s just more zig during compilationreply",
      "I was also curious what direction the article was going to take. The showcase is cool, and the features you mentioned are cool. But for me, Zig is cool is because all the pieces simply fit together with essentially no redundancy or overloading. You learn the constructs and they just compose as you expect. There's one feature I'd personally like added, but there's nothing actually _missing_. Coding in it quickly felt like using a tool I'd used for years, and that's special.Zig's big feature imo is just the relative absence of warts in the core language. I really don't know how to communicate that in an article. You kind of just have to build something in it.reply",
      "Yeah, the real strength of Zig isn't what's there, but what isn't.reply",
      "out of curiosity, what feature do you want?reply",

      "I've tried writing a similar post, but I think it's a bit difficult to sound convincing when talking about why Zig is so pleasant. it's really not any one thing. it's a culmination of a lot of well made, pragmatic decisions that don't sound significant on their own. they just culminate in a development experience that feels pleasantly unique.a few of those decisions seem radical, and I often disagreed with them.. but quite reliably, as I learned more about the decision making, and got deeper into the language, I found myself agreeing with them afterall. I had many moments of enlightenment as I dug deeper.so anyways, if you're curious, give it an honest chance. I think it's a language and community that rewards curiosity. if you find it fits for you, awesome! luckily, if it doesn't, there's plenty of options these days (I still would like to spend some quality time with Odin)reply",
      "I think what sums up Zig for me, is that it's a low level language with a (relatively) limited featureset, but there are a lot of well-designed features that make it feel much higher level at times.For example, there is no language-level support for iterators. But with optionals, and in particular while loop optional unwrapping, it feels quite similar to other languages that do:  var iter = std.mem.splitScalar(u8, \"apple;orange;banana\", ';');\n  \n  while (iter.next()) |fruit| {\n    ... \n  }reply"

      "This is a personal puff piece. Her accomplishments are impressive and well deserved, but she needn't use the title of 'Becoming a Compiler Engineer' as an attack vector to get people interested in understanding how to write a compiler to read her greatest hits of her early to mid 20s.The way to become a compiler engineer by definition is to try and write a compiler , for which the best course of action is to focus on learning how tokenizing, ast building, typechecking, and various intermediate representations work.I don't pretend to know what's the best tutorial for this, but I think this is a fairly good one:https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index...This is for LLVM, but I think doing basic codegen from generic SSA is not a huge leap from this point if one wants to build an entire compiler from scratch.You do not need to be 'goes to MIT' level of smart, but you do have to understand the basic concepts, which I think is an absolutely manageable amount - about a scope of a couple hundred page paperback or a single challenging CS course worth of info to get started.reply",

Maybe it's not a common first or second jobI graduated at the bottom of bear market (2001), and it was hard to get a job.  But this seems a bit differentreply",
      "It's definitely a pretty small world, and to make things worse there are sub-niches -- between which there's certainly cross-pollination, but that's still a barrier to people looking to change jobs. Frontend language semantics (where most PL papers focus) vs. middle-and-back end optimization and hardware support; AoT compilers vs. JITs; CPU targets vs. a blossoming array of accelerators, etc.Beyond that, I've definitely interviewed people who seemed like they could have been smart + capable but who couldn't cut it when it came to systems programming questions.

While the AS path is often the same, the actual peering points are almost always quite different. Most ASes use hot-potato routing - getting packets to the next AS at the closest peering point to the source of the traffic. (And even if cold-potato routing is used, that's still asymmetric). In addition if there are two options with the same AS-path-length hot-potato routing can lead to different AS paths.  This can happen if there's two mutual transit providers between source and destination and various other situations.(EDIT: fixed hot/cold mixup)reply",

      "Unrelated side note, but I haven't written any Ruby in maybe 15 years or so and dammn I forgot how elegant the language is at its core. The author's AppVersion class is so nicely done, it's nuts how succinct eg the compare implementation is.Having done mostly TypeScript and Elixir lately, I had forgotten things could be so succinct yet so clear. The combo of modern (to me) Ruby's lambda syntax (in the .map call), parentheses-less function calls, the fact that arrays implement <=> by comparing each item in order, that there's an overloadable compare operator at all, having multiple value assignments in one go...  It all really adds up!In any other language I can think of real quick (TS, Elixir, C#, Python, PHP, Go) a fair number of these parts would be substantially more wordy or syntaxy at little immediately obvious benefit. Like, this class is super concise but it doesn't trade away any readability at all.Having learned Ruby before Rails became commonplace, with its love for things that automagically work (until they don't), I had kinda grown to dislike it. But had forgotten how core Ruby is just an excellent programming language, regardless of what I think of the Rails ecosystem.reply",

      "Ruby trades away quite a few things for readability. It's beautiful but a lot is being hidden.Some of those languages would have you deal with the problem of allocating multiple arrays in the heap just to compare three numbers. Or give you tools to outlaw passing invalid strings to AppVersion.new (quick: what is the comparison between AppVersions \"foo\" and \"bar\"?).Plus you have very few tools to ensure code remains beautiful. I've worked with Ruby for close to two decades, almost nothing in the real world looks that clean.

Ruby will have code that is ever changing to gain 5%, 10% performance every now and then. You gotta put that on balance: in a language like Go this method would've been ugly from the start but no one would've needed to touch it in 100 years.reply",
      "You never gotta squeeze everything you can everywhere!Regardless of how slow the language is, the 90/10 rule applies: 90% of the time is spent in 10% of the code. Optimize that 10%! Making the rest of the code faster isn't worth the code quality cost.reply",

Resource usage has to do with performance, the DB has no fault in it but the runtime does.Having worked with Rails a ton there\u2019s a very large overhead. Most apps would see a significant speed up if rewritten in a faster language and framework, with no changes to the DB whatsoever.

      "> why isn\u2019t OCaml more popularI've used OCaml a bit and found various issues with it:* Terrible Windows support. With OCaml 5 it's upgraded to \"pretty bad\".* The syntax is hard to parse for humans. Often it turns into a word soup, without any helpful punctuation to tell you what things are. It's like reading a book with no paragraphs, capitalisation or punctuation.* The syntax isn't recoverable. Sometimes you can add a single character and the error message is essentially \"syntax error in these 1000 lines\".* Ocamlfmt is pretty bad. It thinks it is writing prose. It will even put complex `match`es on one line if they fit. Really hurts readability.* The documentation is super terse. Very few examples.* OPAM. In theory... I feel like it should be great. But in practice I find it to be incomprehensible, full of surprising behaviours, and also surprisingly buggy. I still can't believe the bug where it can't find `curl` if you're in more than 32 Unix groups.* Optional type annotation for function signatures throws away a significant benefit of static typing - documentation/understanding and nice error messages.* Tiny ecosystem. Rust gets flak for its small standard library, but OCaml doesn't even have a built in function to copy files.* Like all FP languages it has a weird obsession with singly linked lists, which are actually a pretty awful data structure.It's not all bad though, and I'd definitely take it over C and Python. Definitely wouldn't pick it over Rust though, unless I was really worried about compile times.reply",
      "I would suggest that people interested in using OCaml on Windows (or indeed, OCaml at all) try F# instead. It is still an ML-family language. Incidentally, by targeting the CLR, F# is considerably more deployable (both to users and to developers) than OCaml is. Plus, any old NuGet library written in C# or VB.NET can be used almost trivially in F#. This also solves the problem OP listed about a tiny ecosystem, because the C#/.NET ecosystem is massive.I couldn't agree more with the parent commenter about OCaml documentation. Functional programmers appear to love terseness to an almost extreme degree. Things like `first` are abbreviated to `fst`, which is just odd. Especially now that good IntelliSense means there is no real functional (heh) difference between typing `.fi` and pressing Tab, and typing `.fs` and pressing Tab.The F# documentation is comparatively very spiffy and detailed, with plenty of examples[1][2][3].[1]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/fsharp/language-ref...[2]: https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/[3]: https://fsprojects.github.io/fsharp-cheatsheet/fsharp-cheats...reply",

It's a drag, because it feels like a missed opportunity to let the machine do work for you.Additionally, one of the most pleasant and unique features of OCaml, strong named arguments, doesn't exist in F# (except in methods or whatever). Most programming languages don't have this (or it's hamfisted like in more dynamic languages) so it doesn't seem like a loss, unless you are very cozy with them in OCaml.(I'm bitter about this one because named arguments give safety and convenience. But when you combine them with currying it's like 4 or 5 design patterns that are elegantly provided for you.

      "F# is indeed an ML-family language, but at this point it doesn't have all that much in common with OCaml specifically: it doesn't have the latter's structurally typed object model with inferred row-polymorphic types, nor its extremely powerful module system, not even many convenience features like open variants.reply",
      "A lot of these are learning curve issues, but once you scale them you still permanently suffer with a very deficient, fragmented ecosystem. Until you have built up your own curated set of dependencies for your business stack, anyway.> * Ocamlfmt is pretty bad. It thinks it is writing prose. It will even put complex `match`es on one line if they fit. Really hurts readability.I suggest configuring ocamlformat to use the janestreet profile for better defaults.> * Optional type annotation for function signatures throws away a significant benefit of static typing - documentation/understanding and nice error messages.People should be providing .mli files, but don't. That said, an IDE with type hints helps this enormously. The VS Code plugin for OCaml is the best experience for noobs, hands down.> OPAMyesreply",
      "> * OPAM. In theory... I feel like it should be great. But in practice I find it to be incomprehensible, full of surprising behaviours, and also surprisingly buggy. I still can't believe the bug where it can't find `curl` if you're in more than 32 Unix groups.I couldn\u2019t believe this was an actual bug in opam, and I found it: https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues/5373I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an opam bug, it\u2019s an issue with musl, and they just happened to build their binaries with it.reply"

      "There wasn't ever a \"moment\" when they \"discovered\" the structure of DNA.The closest thing is Franklin's Photograph 51 which took about 100 hours to compile and then took another year to do all the calculations to confirm the position of each atom.Watson and Crick (without the consent of Franklin) saw this Photograph, did some quick analysis, and came up with a couple of models that could match Franklin's photograph. Watson and Crick were already at work trying to crack the model of DNA, but once they got access to Franklin's work, it became the entire basis of their modeling. After about 2 months of this they finally found the double helix structure that matched Franklin's findings.I doubt Crick was on LSD for an entire 2 months. Perhaps he was tripping when he first viewed the photograph?reply",
      "Last time I checked, this was basically folklore. There were some allusions to Francis Crick experimenting with LSD, but their DNA work predates that.Psychedelic proponents like to claim that LSD helped Francis Crick discover the double helix, but every time I go looking for a source it's a circular web of references and articles that cite each other or, at best, claim that Crick mentioned to a friend that LSD helped him.reply",
