This is a small music speaker and they sell a bunch of NFC cards to \"play\" them. You can also buy blank cards and use their app to add whatever you want to them (music, audiobooks, even audio recordings). It's really well made.There are a bunch of other companies with similar products. Some use miniatures instead of NFC cards. If you search the web for NFC music player, there are a few FOSS apps on github so you can focus on the hardware part and use their software on a raspberry pi.This is also great for elders.P.S.: if you fancy a cool project, I'd love to see someone reverse engineering Yoto so it gets the audio from a local server instead.

      "It depends on your wiring but I've had pretty good success with AV2000 powerline ethernet. I get about 400Mbps and a reliable 2ms ping which is good enough for gaming and streaming from my media center.The endpoint in my living room also has a wifi AP so signal is pretty good for laptops and whatnot.In NYC every channel is congested, I can see like 25 access points at any time and half are poorly configured. Any wired medium is better than the air, I could probably propagate a signal through the drywall that's more reliable than wifi here.So having something I can just plug into the wall is pretty nice compared to running cables even if it's a fraction of gigE standards.reply",

      "Rental or do you own?If you own, you should replace and/or move them. Might sound scary if you've never done this before but it is much easier than you'd think. If you want to make your future life easier I suggest running a PVC pipe (at minimum in the drop down portion). Replacing or adding new cabling will be much easier if you do this so it's totally worth the few extra bucks and few extra minutes of work. They'll also be less likely to be accidentally damaged (stepping on them, rodents, water damage, etc). I seriously cannot understand why this is not more common practice (leave the pull string in). You might save a few bucks but you sacrifice a lot more than you're saving... (chasing pennies with pounds)If rental, you could put in an extender. If you're less concerned about aesthetics you can pop the wall place off and directly tie into the existing cable OR run a new one in parallel. If you're willing to donate the replacement wire and don't have access to the attic but do to both ends of the existing cable then you can use one to pull the other through. You could coil the excess wire behind the plate when you reinstall it. But that definitely runs the risk of losing the cable since it might be navigating through a hard corner. If you go that route I'd suggest just asking your landlord. They'd probably be chill about it and might even pay for it.reply",

If you really want to minimize the visual impact you can use cable runners and paint over them. The cables are not attention-grabbing compared to furniture or art on the wall.If you\u2019re willing to drill holes (if you terminate the cable yourself, the hole can be narrow), you can pass the cables through walls.

      "That is very exceptional. I've written fuel estimation software for airliners (cargo, fortunately), and the number of rules regarding go-arounds, alternates and holding time resulted in there usually being quite a bit of fuel in the tanks on landing, by design. I've never heard of '6 minutes left' in practice where it wasn't a massive issue and the investigation into how this could have happened will make for interesting reading. A couple of notes: the wind and the time spent on the three go-arounds + what was necessary to get to the alternate may not be the whole story here, that's actually factored in before you even take off.I'd be very wary to get ahead of the investigation and make speculative statements on how this could have happened, the one thing that I know for sure is that it shouldn't have happened, no matter what.reply",
      "Naively as an outsider, this situation seems like everything worked as intended?On a nominally 2h45m flight, they spent an extra 2 hours in the air, presumably doing doing fuel intensive altitude changing maneuvers, and were eventually able to land safely with their reserves almost exhausted.I\u2019m a little confused by what there is to investigate at all.How much fuel should they have landed with?reply",
      "As others have said, final fuel reserves are typically at least half an hour, and you shouldn't really be cutting into them. What if their first approach into MAN had led to another go around?With a major storm heading north-easterly across the UK, the planning should have reasonably foreseen that an airport 56 miles east may also be unavailable, and should've further diverted prior to that point.They likely used the majority of their final fuel reserve on the secondary diversion from EDI to MAN, presumably having planned to land at their alternate (EDI) around the time they reached the final fuel reserve.Any CAA report into this, if there is one produced, is going to be interesting, because there's multiple people having made multiple decisions that led to this.reply",
      "Just reaching altitude again to make it to the first and later second alternate are mostly likely the biggest factors in the extra fuel consumption. That's very expensive.reply",
      "The 30 min reserve is on top of the fuel needed to reach the alternate and do a landing there, so only the flight to the second alternate, plus the 2nd and 3rd landings at the initial destination would have cut into the reserve.reply",
      "With 100mph winds I could easily see the 30 min reserve being eaten up by the flight from Edinburgh to Manchester.  It's 178 miles!  It takes a good 15-20 minutes to cross that distance when flying normally, add ascent & descent time and the landing pattern and you're easily at 24 minutes.Edit: in other comments here, it seems like Edinburgh to Manchester is a 45 minute flight.  So yeah, they could easily have been outside of reserves when they did the go-around at Edinburgh and still had only 6 minutes left at Manchester.reply",
      "Yeah, although it depends what the alternate was in the flight plan. It may have been Manchester. Although I think its more likely it was Edinburgh, which in the circumstances was too optimistic. Too much concern about the minimal costs of fuel tankering to add a bit more gas? Or saving time by not refuelling?Ive never flown on Ryanair and dont intend to.reply",
      "You get that energy back on descent, no?reply",
      "4 replies and 3 are dismissing even the idea..Yes, you get \"some\" back, and its not negligible amount. Typical modern airliner can descend on 15-20:1, giving you over 150-200km (90-120mi) range from typical cruising altitude of 33 000 feet even with engines off. Most everyday descents are actually done by maintaining altitude as long as possible, and then iddling the engines fully for as long as clearance allows. (Ofc you then use engines as you geat nearer, because its safer to be a little low when stabilizing on approach, than a little high)Thanks to turbofans(edited from turboprops) better efficiency + less drag at higher altitude its actually more fuel economical to command full thrust and gain altitude quickly, than slower climb, or maintaining altitude (which goes against our intuition from cars, where if you wanna get far, you never give full throttle).But theres still some drag, so you dont get everything back, so you generally want to avoid murking in low altitudes as long as possible. Full thrust repeatedly at lowest altitudes (from failed go arounds) is the least economical part of flight, so you want to avoid those if possible. But its true that the altitude you gain is equivalent to \"banking\" the energy, just not all of it.reply",
      "(1) this was a jet, not a turbopropEdit: changed turbofan into turbprop, which is what I meant.(2) fuel burned stays burned, you don't 'get it back'(3) the altitude gained may have been adjusted to account for the low fuel situation(4) the winds are a major factor here, far larger than the fact that 'what goes up must come down', something that is already taken into account when computing the fuel reserve in the first place.reply"

      "AMD, do support for NV_shader_buffer_load next! Shader Buffer Load brought \"Buffer Device Address\" / pointers to OpenGL/glsl, long before Vulkan was even a thing. It's the best thing since sliced bread, and easily lets you access all your vertex data with pointers, i.e., you don't need to bind any vertex buffers anymore. Also easily lets you draw the entire scene in a single draw call since vertex shaders can just load data from wherever the pointers lead them, e.g., it makes GLSL vertex shaders look like this:    uniform Node* u_nodes;\n    \n    void main(){\n    \n        Node node = u_nodes[gl_DrawID];\n        \n        vec3 pos = node.position[gl_VertexID];\n        vec2 uv  = node.uv[gl_VertexID];\n    \n        ...\n    }reply",
      "You could do similar thing with SSBO, I think?reply",
      "That is for SSBOs. u_nodes is a pointer to an SSBO in this case. That SSBO then has lots of more pointers to various different SSBOs that contain the vertex data.reply",
      "I'm thinking of declaring array of SSBOs that contain array of data structs. Address would be represented by index of SSBO binding and offset within that buffer. Though that limits maximum number of used SSBOs within drawcall to GL_MAX_VERTEX_SHADER_STORAGE_BLOCKS.reply",
      "To my knowledge you can't have an array of SSBOs in OpenGL. You could have one SSBO for everything, but that makes other things very difficult, like how to deal with dynamically growing scenes, loading and unloading models, etc.reply",
      "From https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_shade...:   (3) \"Do we allow arrays of shader storage blocks?\n\n        RESOLVED:  Yes; we already allow arrays of uniform blocks, where each\n        block instance has an identical layout but is backed by a separate\n        buffer object.  It seems like we should do this here for consistency.\n\nPS: You could also access data through bindless textures, though you would need to deal with ugly wrappers to unpack structs from image formats.reply",
      "Do you have an example for that? I can't find any.Regarding bindless textures, they're really ugly to use. Shader buffer load is so much better, being able to access everything with simple pointers.reply",
      "Here's some code: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-API/issues/46 But yeah, GL_MAX_VERTEX_SHADER_STORAGE_BLOCKS limits usefulness of that.I wanted to say that with some compiler hacking it should be possible to lower SPIR-V using GL_EXT_buffer_reference into bindless image loads, but SPIR-V doesn't have standardized bindless texture, duh!reply",
      "A little bit off topic but: GL_LINES doesn't have a performant analog on lots of other platforms, even Unity. Drawing a line properly requires turning the two endpoint vertices into a quad and optionally adding endcaps which are at least triangular but can be polygons. From my understanding, that requires a geometry shader since we're adding virtual/implicit vertices. Does anyone know if mesh shaders could accomplish the same thing?Also I wish that GL_LINES was open-sourced for other platforms. Maybe it is in the OpenGL spec and I just haven't looked. I've attempted some other techniques like having the fragment shader draw a border around each triangle, but they all have their drawbacks.reply",
      "I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but you can both output line primitives directly from the mesh shader or output mitered/capped extruded lines via triangles.As far as other platforms, there's VK_EXT_line_rasterization which is a port of opengl line drawing functionality to vulkan.reply"

In particular we all need to thank Qiang Yu (AMD), who spearheaded this initiative and did the vast majority of the work both in writing the specification and doing the core mesa implementation. Shihao Wang (AMD) took on the difficult task of writing actual CTS cases (not mandatory for EXT extensions in GL, so this is a huge benefit to the ecosystem).Big thanks to both of you, and everyone else behind the scenes at AMD, for making this happen.Also we have to thank the nvidium project and its author, Cortex, for single-handedly pushing the industry forward through the power of Minecraft modding.

      "There are two significant ways in which this differs from a Rubik's cube.1. It's abelian. Moves can be done in any order, to the same result.2. there's a simple algo to solve this. Working from top to bottom, left to right: click the first white cell, then click the cell below it. (Then there's a simple endgame at the end once the bottom row is reached.)reply",
      "Hi everyone, I'm the OP and wanted to share a few comments that might come as spoilers. So read with caution!1. The default game has a simple winning strategy: the app begins with a 5x5 board under the \"Same Row & Column\" variant. Some here have already figured out how to get all reds: [Memorize all the white squares on the board at some fixed moment, and click those cells in any order.] Some of the info below helps see why.2. The game is always winnable: the app is set up to secretly begin with all reds and then perform many random clicks to mess it up; it's always reversible.3. The order of clicks doesn't matter: the click actions commute.4. Every click is self-inverse: clicking a cell twice under any variant leads to the same board as before.5. A winning strategy need only list out which cells to click once: Because of the properties of commutativity and self-inverse, any winning strategy could be freely shuffled in order and have any duplicate clicks cancel out, leading to a strategy of cells meant to be clicked just once---the rest ignored.6. Suppose \"n\" is odd and play the \"Same Row & Column\" variant. Then, the n-by-n board is solvable by the strategy of \"click all the cells that were white.\" But when \"n\" is even, then this strategy fails on the n-by-n board. However, there indeed is another strategy that solves those systematically.7. Very little is known about the other variants, nor about other sizes and dimensions of boards. And it is not true in general that any random pattern of white-and-red can be turned into all-reds. Try to find a good heuristic for separating out winnable vs. unwinnable boards!8. I did forget to mention other versions of Lights Out besides the handheld game. Other physical games and video games used the 5x5 \"Adjacent\" variant, too.Bonus Questions:1. Can you think of an interesting clicking-rule variant that would not be commutative?2. Can you come up with the winning strategy for winning n-by-n boards when n is even under the \"Same Row & Column\" variant?3. Can you figure out any winning strategy for the other variants? I haven't found any good way to proceed without just memorizing the solutions.Thanks for the comments!reply",
      "Memorize which cells are white when the board first loads. Tap all of those in order without regard to the way the board changes as you go.Edit: above tested for 5x5 rows&cols. For even boards it seems there\u2019s a small end-game to repeat the process \u2014 something about parity I assume.reply",
      "And you can do that at any board state, so if it starts with like 16 white squares you can make one or two greedy moves to minimize white squares, then do your memorize trick.reply",
      "Yea that can shave a few moves off.For fun you can also, for example, invert any board in N moves by tapping every cell straight across any row or column.reply",
      "Interesting, and black magic as far as I'm concerned. How does that algorithm translate onto the Rubik's cube (which I evidently never learned to solve)?reply",
      "Why does that work?reply",
      "If you think of each button press as a matrix being added to the board state where only the row and column are set to 1, along with the commutative nature of the moves (order doesn't matter), then as long as the total number of \"flips\" from the cumulative matrices of moves is odd, then it will reset the board.Mathematically I might say that the system's precomputed solution vector is readily apparent.reply",
