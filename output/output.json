      "Hi,I'm David Rhodes, Co-founder of CG Nomads, developer of GSOPs (Gaussian Splatting Operators) for SideFX Houdini. GSOPs was used in combination with OTOY OctaneRender to produce this music video.If you're interested in the technology and its capabilities, learn more at https://www.cgnomads.com/ or AMA.Try GSOPs yourself: https://github.com/cgnomads/GSOPs (example content included).reply",
      "I\u2019m fascinated by the aesthetic of this technique. I remember early versions that were completely glitched out and presented 3d clouds of noise and fragments to traverse through. I\u2019m curious if you have any thoughts about creatively \u2018abusing\u2019 this tech? Perhaps misaligning things somehow or using some wrong inputs.reply",
      "There's a ton of fun tricks you can perform with Gaussian splatting!You're right that you can intentionally under-construct your scenes. These can create a dream-like effect.It's also possible to stylize your Gaussian splats to produce NPR effects. Check out David Lisser's amazing work: https://davidlisser.co.uk/Surface-Tension.Additionally, you can intentionally introduce view-dependent ghosting artifacts. In other words, if you take images from a certain angle that contain an object, and remove that object for other views, it can produce a lenticular/holographic effect.reply",

      "I have. Personally, I'm a big fan of hybrid representations like this. An underlying mesh helps with relighting, deformation, and effective editing operations (a mesh is a sparse node graph for an otherwise unstructured set of data).However, surface-based constraints can prevent thin surfaces (hair/fur) from reconstructing as well as vanilla 3DGS. It might also inhibit certain reflections and transparency from being reconstructed as accurately.reply",

      "Something that may be interesting for the reader of this thread: this project was possible only once I started to tell Opus that it needed to take a file with all the implementation notes, and also accumulating all the things we discovered during the development process. And also, the file had clear instructions to be taken updated, and to be processed ASAP after context compaction. This kinda enabled Opus to do such a big coding task in a reasonable amount of time without loosing track. Check the file IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md in the GitHub repo for more info.reply",
      "Very cool!Yep, a constantly updated spec is the key. Wrote about this here:https://lukebechtel.com/blog/vibe-speccingI've also found it's helpful to have it keep an \"experiment log\" at the bottom of the original spec, or in another document, which it must update whenever things take \"a surprising turn\"reply",
      "We found, especially with Opus and recent claude code that it is better/more precise at reading existing code for figuring out what the current status is than reading specs. It seems (for us) it is less precise at 'comprehending' the spec English than it is the code and that will sometimes reflect in wrong assumptions for new tasks which will result in incorrect implementations of those tasks. So we dropped this. Because of caching, it doesn't seem too bad on the tokens either.reply",
      "Honest question: what do you do when your spec has grown to over a megabyte?Some things I've been doing:- Move as much actual data into YML as possible.- Use CEL?- Ask Claude to rewrite pseudocode in specs into RFC-style constrained language?How do you sync your spec and code both directions? I have some slash commands that do this but I'm not thrilled with them?I tend to have to use Gemini for actually juggling the whole spec. Of course it's nice and chunked as much as it can be? but still. There's gonna need to be a whole new way of doing this.If programming languages can have spooky language at a distance wait until we get into \"but paragraph 7, subsection 5 of section G clearly defines asshole as...\"What does a structured language look like when it doesn't need mechanical sympathy?\nYML + CEL is really powerful and underexplored but it's still just ... not what I'm actually wanting.reply",
      "Sharding or compaction, both possible with LLMs.Sharding: Make well-named sub-documents for parts of work. LLM will be happy to create these and maintain cross references for you.Compaction: Ask the LLM to compact parts of the spec, or changelog, which are over specified or redundant.reply",
      "My question was something like: what is the right representation for program semantics when the consumer is an LLM and the artifact exceeds context limits?\"Make sub-documents with cross-references\" is just... recreating the problem of programming languages but worse. Now we have implicit dependencies between prose documents with no tooling to track them, no way to know if a change in document A invalidates assumptions in document B, no refactoring support, no tests for the spec.To make things specific:https://github.com/ctoth/polyarray-specreply",
      "Ah, I see your point more clearly now.At some level you have to do semantic compression... To your point on non-explicitness -- the dependencies between the specs and sub-specs can be explicit (i.e. file:// links, etc).But your overall point on assumption invalidation remains... Reminds me of a startup some time ago that was doing \"Automated UX Testing\" where user personas (i.e. prosumer, avg joe, etc) were created, and Goals/ Implicit UX flows through the UI were described (i.e. \"I want to see my dashboard\", etc). Then, an LLM could pretend to be each persona, and test each day whether that user type could achieve the goals behind their user flow.This doesn't fully solve your problem, but it hints at a solution perhaps.Some of what you're looking for is found by adding strict linter / tests. But your repo looks like something in an entirely different paradigm and I'm curious to dig into it more.reply",
      "I'm still sharing this post in the internal org trainings I run for those new to LLMs. Thanks for it - really great overview of the concept!I saw in your other comment you've made accommodations for the newer generation, and I will confess than in Cursor (with plan mode) I've found an abbreviated form works just as well as the extremely explicit example found in the post.If you ever had a followup, I imagine it'd be just as well received!reply",
      "Looks like default OpenCode / Claude Code behavior with Claude models. Why the extra prompt ?reply",
      "Good question!1. The post was written before this was common :)2. If using Cursor (as I usually am), this isn't what it always does by default, though you can invoke something like it using \"plan\" mode. It's default is to keep todo items in a little nice todo list, but that isn't the same thing as a spec.3. I've found that Claude Code doesn't always do this, for reasons unknown to me.4.

      "Interesting - I just spent all day on this on an app which I'm using. My architecture is a little different (probably worse).The app lives on a single OpenBSD server. All user data is stored in /srv/app/[user]. Authentication is done by accessing OpenBSD Auth helper functions.Users can access their data through the UI normally. Or they can use a web based filesystem browser to edit their data files. Or, alternately, they can ssh into the server and have full access to their files with all the advantages this entails. Hopefully, this raises the ceiling a bit for what power users of the system can accomplish.I wanted to unify the OS ecosystem and the web app ecosystem and play around with the idea of what happens if those things aren't separate. I'm sure I'm introducing all kinds of security concerns which I'm not currently aware of.Another commenter brought up Perkeep, which I think is very interesting. Even though I love Plan 9 conceptually, I do sort of wonder if \"everything is a file\" was a bit of a wrong turn.

Dan argues that this structure is not inevitable. If social data is treated as something people own and store themselves, applications stop being the owners of social graphs and become interfaces that read from user-controlled data instead.I am working on a similar model for commerce. Sellers deploy their own commerce logic such as orders, carts, and payments as a hosted service they control, and marketplaces integrate directly with seller APIs rather than hosting sellers. This removes platform overhead, lowers fees, and shifts ownership back to the people creating value, turning marketplaces into interoperable discovery layers instead of gatekeepers.reply",

One thing I am curious about is whether there is a different kind of science fiction out there. The driving thread through all of modern English sci-fi is \"we shouldn't go out there and do anything; we are the bad that ruins a delicate thing\". That's a cool story but somewhat overly tropey at this point I think. This short story, the Avatar series, they have this ecological moralizing. AT is creative enough that the novel ideas (single species life-cycle planet) carry the tale even though the moral thread is the same as the Avatar movie: corporations destroy ecosystems they don't understand in the resource pursuit.I enjoy the \"what if we're the baddies\" just as much as anyone else. But are there big stories with these exciting concepts where we aren't the baddies in the Anglosphere?A thing I enjoy about other cultures is seeing what is unusually different about them. In the Three Body Problem, spoilers to follow for the series, humanity aren't The Bad Guys With Agency. We aren't even The Big Bad or The Big Good. We're sort of just other participants in this universe. The dual vector foil is employed by someone else, the guys who want space back from the pocket dimension to reboot the universe are just someone else, everything is someone else. We are bit part players in this play.This goes on even to a few movies. The Wandering Earth movie (somewhat different from the short story) has this part at the end (obvious spoilers to follow) where the heroes accomplish the task and reboot their Earth Engine after conquering all odds - only for the camera to zoom out and show numerous other teams also having done the same. This wasn't the only struggle won. Cool alternative tale where it isn't so much One Team Saves The World or One Team Ruins The World.reply",

Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR.

We already pay for workspace so why not.What kept us on slack is the external partners who are on slack. \nThis is a bigger deal than you might think.Google chat doesn't allow you to add external members unless they were added at the creation of the channel. Seems like a strange limitation.I don't even think the slack search is really that much of a value add.We split our meeting between huddles, usually when there is only two or three of us, or google meet.We're also more than 5, but to be clear. Your pricing is the pricing for the team, not per user?I wish you all the best, and I'd be keen to try it as we only currently have 3 external partners, but if you can nail that management of external users, I think that is important.I'm also assuming there are desktop/mobile/web apps? Also necessary, though also a lot of overhead for a small team.Notifications need to be solid as well.reply",
      "Pricing: Yes, exactly. It is a flat fee for the whole team. $15/month covers your entire group (up to 20 people). No per-seat billing. We hate that \"tax\" as much as you do.\nExternal Partners: You hit the nail on the head. We are building \"Guest Access\" so you can invite external partners to specific channels (single-channel guests) easily.Since we don't charge per-seat, adding a few clients/partners won't blow up your bill like it does on Slack.\nApps: We are launching as a high-performance PWA (Web) first. It installs to your dock/home screen and feels native, but allows us to iterate faster than maintaining three separate codebases. Native wrappers are coming, but we want the core experience to be rock solid first.reply",

      "Nice to see this posted. I spent probably too much time on Stirling engines and associated stuff (heat engines in general, the Vuilleumier family of devices and other interesting bits & pieces).It's so tempting, you think there has to be a way to make it work. But I haven't found one yet and I more or less gave up on it. The most practical ones that I'm aware of are in spacecraft for extreme cooling and in a commercially available generator.If you've never seen one up close I highly recommend building a model of one and watching it run, it is complete magic compared to internal combustion engines which tend to be noisy and dirty. Stirling engines run so quiet you have to be right up close to realize it is running at all (and even then you probably will subconsciously put your hand on it to verify that it is not just your imagination).The Philips company, when it still meant something, put together a whole slew of pilots: a boat and a bus, and an endless number of them in the lab. Fortunes have been sunk in these and with preciously little to show for it other than an extreme appreciation for how hard it is to make a really good seal.Wurm et al's book is the standard in the field, it is very thorough and gives a very good grounding in the theory as well as some appreciation on why this is both a tempting and very hard subject at the same time. Most engines are hard to think of and relatively easy to engineer once you've thought of them. There are two exceptions, Stirling engines and Wankel engines and both have very strongly related problems. Solve the seal issue and the world will pave the way to your door with gold.reply",
      "Stirling engines are a perfect illustration of what I call Odum's Paradox:  The closer a heat engine/pump gets to maximum theoretical efficiency, the lower its power density.\n\nThis is a simple consequence of thermodynamics. By approaching the Carnot efficiency you're asymptotically approaching an adiabatic cycle, so there's less and less entropy gain to drive the system forward. At the Carnot efficiency the cycle becomes completely time-reversible and all power stops, so as you get closer and closer the power density drops toward zero.Odum observed[0] that (for certain linear assumptions) the maximum power density is achieved at half the theoretical Carnot efficiency. He noted that both real engines and biological systems tend to cluster around this optimum.What's interesting, but not terribly surprising, is that this implies a fundamental and unavoidable tradeoff between machinery cost and operating efficiency.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_principlereply",
      "One interesting mention I can recall of one was in a airport-kiosk type thriller/science fiction novel where a humanoid robot developed by the military wound up in the jungles of South America assisting a group of disparate individuals --- it made a small Stirling engine using a lathe to power itself from the communal campfire --- always wondered if the physics of that would work out numerically.reply",
      "Most likely not if it was made from stuff you can find the jungle but it is a very creative bit. I've had one running of a 10' solar concentrator, it was tiny (no more than a few hundred mW) but still, to see sunlight directly converted into motion without any steps in between is quite a neat thing.reply",

Heat transferred to the coolant can be used to heat domestic water cylinders and for space heating.\n\n~ https://www.victronenergy.com/Manuals/WhisperGen/UserManual/...There was a European branch in Spain, seems to have withered, and some stories about expansion plans and pivoting that got trashed by the earthquake fallout.~ https://www.smh.com.au/business/nzs-whispergen-to-move-to-eu...Damn shame - I had access to an early model looong ago and was really looking forward to seeing where that went.reply",

      "There is something to be said about the state of advertising.Increasingly it seems you must go to the almighty Google or Meta in order to launch any business.We're looking to expand into a new business line and have out grown our pharmacy capacity.The new business line will cost about $2M in software dev, and $3M for the new facility. The advertising budget? $40,000,000 (annual).We can build 10 robotic pharmacies (~10 staff per 4000 fills daily, each) for the price of just the advertising.Increasingly we wonder why America doesn't build more and here is why. You are going to give all your revenue to two platforms. Unless you operate in a business line with 50% margin you are screwed.I don't know what the solution is, but its clear that the platforms are figuring out how much margin everyone has and slowly eroding it. Somewhere between 8-15% of the cost of all products we purchase is advertising spend.reply",
      "Advertising spend being too high is a symptom of a supply glut.  Too many products in the marketplace, not enough consumers to buy them.In a different world where there are higher wages, more people would have more spending power.  Then companies wouldn't have to spend as many dollars on advertising, which they could split between higher wages, higher margins and lower prices.Alas, the short-term single-firm directional incentive for company decision makers in that world leads to marginal prioritization of higher margins.  The loss of wages leads to loss of consumer spending power but it's spread across the economy.  But every firm has the same incentive so they all do the same thing, and the good thing gets ruined.This line of thinking leads to a Georgist-ish conclusion:  The class conflict shouldn't be between workers and employers.  They should be allies; the real cause of nobody being able to afford anything is rent extractors.  (Writing in the 1800's, George [1] was most concerned about land rents; but the advertising monopoly of Google / Meta may be another form of extractive rent with similar characteristics.)Maybe Henry Ford was on to something when he shocked the world by paying his employees enough to afford the product they were making (more than doubling many workers' wages)...[1] https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-book-review-progress-a...reply",
      ">Maybe Henry Ford was on to something when he shocked the world by paying his employees enough to afford the product they were making (more than doubling many workers' wages)...That's a nice story to tell, but the economics never works out if you do the math. Whatever extra wages you pay, you only get a fraction of that back in increased sales. How much percent of a worker's income do you think is spent on a car? As a rough measure we can use the BLS's CPI weights for \"new and used vehicles\", which comes in at 7.4%, with an extra 1.4% if you include maintenance and parts. By that alone \"paying his employees enough to afford the product they were making\" is going to be a losing proposition, because Ford can only hope to get 8.8% of whatever they paid in wages back as revenue. And all of this is ignoring the fact that you can't pay extra wages out of revenue, only profit, so you can only hope to recoup a fraction of that 8.8%.reply",
      "thats an overly simplistic way to look at it. Of course you can never get more money from your employees' purchases than you give them, that makes no sense. The point is using your market power as a large employer to raise market salaries. People will not want to work for your competitors or other sectors if they pay half what you do. So when you rise, naturally other salaries will rise too. And those other workers will also be buying cars.Whether that makes sense economically is a difficult problem to quantify, especially over any fixed timeframe. I would guess not, at least if your brand isnt insanely strong (on the level of half or more people with enough money would buy it)reply",
      "Obviously this would never work with a single employer. But I think the point is moreso that if every employer, in an altruistic sense, decided to pay their employees enough to afford more purchasing power, the entire market would grow fasterreply",
      "It's a collective action problem. \nIf everyone pays higher wages, there's a greater supply of money for buying stuff / solving problems (assuming the higher wages aren't eaten by rents). No individual form recoups all of the higher wages they pay their workers, obviously, but there's a larger market for the goods of everyone has more money.reply",
      "Is there? Covid stimulus would say there isn't. Granted a company raising wages doesn't print money out of air like the Fed but the amount of goods doesn't change, the cost of the goods adjusts to the monetary supply. You now pay more for the same.reply",
      ">If everyone pays higher wages, there's a greater supply of money for buying stuff / solving problems (assuming the higher wages aren't eaten by rents). No individual form recoups all of the higher wages they pay their workers, obviously, but there's a larger market for the goods of everyone has more money.Does this actually work? Suppose you're on an island where the economy only produces coconuts. How does giving workers more coconuts make the economy grow, such that there's more coconuts to go around overall? Unless the workers were absolutely famished, giving them more coconuts isn't going to increase productivity. You might argue this model isn't representative of the real world, but that's approximately how the economy works. It can produce a certain amount of \"stuff\" (ie. coconuts), of which some portion can be given to workers, and the remainder can be given to the kings/elites/capitalists/whatever. Unless you improve productivity, there isn't going to be magically more stuff to go around.Giving each worker a car can plausibly increase their productivity (less time spent commuting?) but the effect is small, and unlikely to be recouped by car companies. The situation looks even worse in the current economy. If everyone's paychecks were 10% bigger, what marginal item do you think it'll be spent on? A bigger car? A new iPhone or big screen TV? How would any of those increase productivity?reply",
      "> Suppose you're on an island where the economy only produces coconuts.This is why nobody takes economists seriously. What you lose in simplifying down to this model is literally everything. The coconut economy has zero predictive power.In the real world, distribution effects dramatically affect the functioning of the economy, because workers are also consumers and owners of capital are siphoning off the purchasing power of their customers. Productivity isn\u2019t the question in the modern economy - we\u2019re already massively overproducing just about everything - our problem is both our wealth and production allocations are borderline suicidal.reply",
      ">This is why nobody takes economists seriously. What you lose in simplifying down to this model is literally everything. The coconut economy has zero predictive power.A simplified model is needed otherwise rigorous analysis becomes impossible, and people make handwavy arguments about how paying workers more means they can spend more, which means factories, and it's a perpetual growth machine!>we\u2019re already massively overproducing just about everythingNo we're not. If we weren't, we shouldn't have seen the massive inflation near the end of covid. The supply disruptions hit almost immediately, but it wasn't until the stimmy checks hit that inflation went up.>our problem is both our wealth and production allocations are borderline suicidal.If you read my previous comments more carefully, you'd note that I'm not arguing against better wages for workers as a whole, only that contrary to what some people claim, they don't pay for themselves.reply"

      "As a Windows system and user-mode dev, I absolutely never understand these sorts of drive-by posts with nearly zero technical depth.If there is one thing about Windows that is really good, it is its kernel and driver architecture, and absolute plethora of user-mode libraries that come with the OS, that can be programmed against with a variety of languages from ancient to brand-new, all maintained by the vendor. Doing the same thing on a given distro of Linux is a headache at best, and impossible at worst (which is partly why game developers don't target native Linux).The problems with Windows have always been in the user-mode (with the notable exception of Vista, and I still maintain that Vista was OK; its problems were due to Intel strong-arming MS into certifying a broken version of Vista for its sub-par integrated GPUs of the time). Windows 11 control panel sort-of gone? There's still the god-mode menu introduced in Vista. Right-click menu gone, or too much Copilot? Go to Group Policy editor, switch off what you don't need; revert what you can. People complain you 'cannot create local user accounts any more'. Also not true, that feature is a fundamental part of Windows and probably won't ever be removed. There are workarounds. Any Windows user or sysadmin worth their salt will have a GPE fleet-wide policy, and registry settings.Everything one sees on Windows can be stripped out and reverted to Windows 2000 mode. That grey boxy UI is literally still there. Compile a program for 32-bit, set the compatibility mode to Windows 2000, and bam, there you go. If you add in the manifests for UTF-8 and high pixel density, the UI is scaled pixel-perfect by the system.Speaking of high pixel density, Windows is the only OS that does scaling properly. macOS just pretends non-'retina' displays don't exist, Linux distros are a minefield of Xorg, Wayland, a million different conf.d files, command-line arguments, and env variables.Why would anyone want to replace their core product with something that a) they cannot control, and b) does not satisfy their business and customer needs?reply",
      "The Intel thing is extremely true, but also equally true is the god awful Nvidia drivers that existed in the early days of Windows Vista.
