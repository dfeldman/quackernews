      "The best \u201dalgorithm\u201d for discovering new music was digging through profiles on last.fm back when the social functions of the site were still active. Sure, it was a lot of manual work, but the results were amazing. It wasn't completely blind, I found that people I had high similarity with, it was more likely I'll like what they like, even across different genres. Sometimes people were nice and took the effort to recommend based on my profile. I got introduced to varied music, different genres and even a bit from different countries.The worst was Pandora, which did recommendations based on breakdown of musical instruments and elements in the song. It did what it aimed to do pretty well, only it was a bad idea. It gave you  a lot of uninspiring music that sounded like a bland copy of something you actually liked.Spotify's recommendations are not super awful, but definitely feel closer to Pandora's style. I wonder why is the result like that even though I'm sure they train their model based on listening history.reply",
      "what.cd was the world's greatest music discovery mechanism. You could always ask for recommendations in the forums or in the comment thread of the albums pages. The community always delivered. I miss that type of camaraderie. I also spent more on music as a member of that community than since it has been disbanded.reply",
      "The best way to discover music nowadays is RateYourMusic. I go to an album I like, read a couple reviews to find like-minded people and check out their profiles. They often have lists with their favorite albums.The album chart queries are also incredible. The site has a very detailed system of genres and descriptors so you can find exactly what you want.reply",
      "my method is just internet/local radio stations ( there are many ) and browsing the lineups at venues near mesimple, very little time investment required and avoids most modern fuckeryreply",
      "I used to pay for their radio service, it was a bit like Pandora. I found it when they added it to Xbox 360 as an app.I really liked their original profile pages that had sort of a MySpace style customization & vibe. You could have your favorite musicians and tracks analyzed through their API by these 3rd party services that would create very cool graphics & charts to show off to friends and visitors what you were into.But, then I guess they ran out of money and were really trying to get scooped up by Spotify. They turned off their music player, disabled all the profile customization, alternative services quit having built in scrobbling to it.I remember I had to download an app that would constantly have my microphone open and it would ID the song I was listening to via some kind of Shazam service and send it to last.fm. I never considered what a security risk that was because I was more interested in keeping my last.fm music tracked.reply",
      "I found so much indie electronic music I loved to listen to back then, via last fm. I don\u2019t listen to any of it any more. Or have any interest toreply",
      "My favorite manual discovery/social was Napster, for that moment that you could view other user\u2019s entire shared music folder and use the chat function to talk to them about their tastes!reply",
      "I was just talking about this in r/piracy but I remember there was a chat function on Kazaa where you could message people you were downloading music from and ask for recommendations. Simpler times...reply",
      "So, all I\u2019m hearing is that, when we actually took the humans out of the loop and replaced them with algorithms, all the humanity disappeared?\u201dIf take human out \u2026 why human there no more???\u201dIt\u2019s shocking this species is able to come up with such advanced technologies when the above is the existential question that plagues them in the macro.reply",
      "I find it funny and sad that people get so excited about those Wrapped year-end things on Spotify when these companies are basically withholding all this data all year long and then pretend like it's a special treat when they doll out a peek at it once a year.It feels to me like \"dark mode\" (which is a merely single color of customization for an app). We expect so little from our software and services that even these little, previously common features are supposed to be a treat.Anyway, Last.fm was great -- I never used it that much for discovery, but rather to get insight into what I was listening to. Largely, it didn't say THAT much about my habits because I mostly just listened to my collection on random. My top bands were, for the most part, the bands I had the most of.reply"

      "A few things I've come to personally believe after spending years developing web and robotics software in Python/JavaScript then spending years having to maintain while constantly adding new features and dealing with company pivots:- The types exist whether you write them down or not.- If they're not written down, they're written down in your head.- Your head is very volatile and hard for others to access.- Typing is an incredibly good form of documentation.- JSDoc and TypeScript are standards/formats for typing. Like any tools, they both have advantages and disadvantages. Neither is objectively better than the other.- Make informed decisions on how you'll describe your types, and then be consistent and unsurprising.- A type checker is the computer saying, \"okay then, prove it\" about your program's type validity.- Not every program benefits from the same amount of \"prove it.\"- Too much can be as bad as too little. You're wasting resources proving throwaway code.- I like languages that let you decide how much you need to \"prove it.\"reply",
      "> JSDoc and TypeScript are standards/formats for typing. Like any tools, they both have advantages and disadvantages. Neither is objectively better than the other.Agreed. Just to clarify, my intentions with this post weren't to advocate for one over the other. Just to point out that they are the same thing. They are both TypeScript.reply",
      "So, some history. When SPA's started to boom on the web JSDoc was a life saver for typing. Application state was getting more complex. We needed more guard rails.Then Google Closure Compiler came along which added type safety via JSDOC and TS came along with (TS)JSDoc support and it's own TS syntax.The community chose native TS and Google Closure compiler slipped away into the background.So (TS)JSDoc support is a relic from when Microsoft was trying to get market share from Google.Today in 2025, TS offers so much more than the (TS)JSDoc implementation. Generics, Enums, Utility types, Type Testing in Vitest, typeguards, plus other stuff.Today I use TS. I also use plain JSDoc for documentation. e.g. @link and @see for docs. Or @deprecated when I'm flagging a method to be removed. @example for a quick look up of how to use a component.TS and plain JSDoc are both important together. But (TS)JSDoc alone, is a relic of the past.reply",
      "> Today in 2025, TS offers so much more than the (TS)JSDoc implementation. Generics, Enums, Utility types, Type Testing in Vitest, typeguards, plus other stuff.This was my main impetus for writing this article. Modern JSDoc uses the TypeScript language service. You can use generics, utility types, typeguards (including the `is` keyword), regex parsing, etc all with just JSDoc.I used these features extensively (especially generics) in a personal project and managed to do it all in JSDoc.reply",

On the other, given how many different parts of the web dev pipeline require one, it seems very tricky to get all of your dependencies to be build-step-free.

ESM is still tricky to use without assistance.None of these are necessary. But if you use any of them you've already committed to having a build step, so adding in a typescript-erasure step isn't much extra work.reply",

The premier darling of web frameworks ostensibly rejecting the benefits of static typing was a big deal.1 So Rich Harris felt compelled to hop onto HN and explain how this was \"not a vindication of anti-Typescript positions\".Harris offered a considered take on why moving type declarations from .ts files to JSDoc comments in .js files was not an anti-TypeScript take. In fact, Harris asserted that Svelte's \"commitment to TypeScript [was] stronger than ever.\"This event heralded (and served as a citation for) a flood of \"TypeScript VS JSDoc\" blog posts and forum threads that offered the somewhat novel defense of JSDoc as \"all the benefits of TypeScript without the build step\" (albeit with"

      "I think that the real power of spaced repetition is not in flashcard applications like this. It is in behavior modification.Let's take a real example to show how this works.August 19, 2025. My wife called me in to help her decide what to do about a dentist that she thought was ripping her off. A couple of quick suggestions later, and she went to being mad at me about not having heard the problem through before trying to fix it badly. As soon as she was mad, I immediately connected with how stupid what I did was, and that this never goes well. But, of course, it was now too late.Not a mistake I was going to make for a while. But, given my history, a mistake I was bound to make again.I changed that. This time I stuck this into my spaced repetition system. Each time the prompt comes up, I remember that scene, holding in mind how it important it is to emotionally engage, not offer quick suggestions, and be sure to listen to the full problem in detail. It takes me less than 30 seconds. Reviewing this prompt, for my whole lifetime, will take less than 15 minutes of work.  Just typing this up this time takes more work than I'll spend on it in the next several years.This mistake hasn't happened since. Not once. And I believe it won't again in my life.I have literally changed dozens of such behaviors. My wife says that it is like there is a whole new me. She can't believe the transformation.All it took is looking at spaced repetition as general purpose structured reinforcement, and not as just a way to study flashcards.reply",
      "I love this example because the correct, wise approach is so alien to my mind that I do not know how to respond to such situations. I am a professional problem solver, you described a problem, yet you do not want it solved? Just talk about it being annoying, like an immutable facet of the universe? Should I retort about my grievances with gravity making roof repairs a bear?reply",
      "> I am a professional problem solver, you described a problem, yet you do not want it solved?This will be hard for you to believe, but I will easily wager good money that at times you yourself behave this way. You only become aware of it after both below are satisfied:1. You've encountered someone as annoying as yourself :-)2. You learn a bit more about the dynamics of conversations.If there's any time someone got mad at you and said \"You just want to complain and not fix the problem!\" chances are this dynamic was in play. Or \"I've given you so many suggestions but you don't want to fix the problem and just complain!\"Everyone acts that way to some extent. Some more than others.Here's a typical scenario (common amongst spouses, but even amongst friends). You're annoyed/down due to problem X. Your friend sees you that way and inquires why you're down. You tell them, and they spend all their time giving you suggestions. But you never asked for suggestions!It's not a big leap to go from there to someone simply telling you their problem because they want to get it out of their system.Some books I've read that made it easier to understand all of this:- Difficult Conversations- Nonviolent Communication[1]- Crucial ConversationsAll of these will emphasize the role emotions play in dialogue. And when you read them, chances are very high you'll find yourself in them (i.e. they will give examples that you can relate to - on both sides of the conversation).Once I read these, many, many \"poor\" conversations from my life earlier suddenly made sense to me. One nice outcome was learning that even though at times people were upset at me, it wasn't always \"my fault\". I had always taken for granted that because I didn't spend much time playing social games, that my social skills were poor and likely I did something wrong. Reading these made it clear how often the dysfunction was on the other side, and having good/poor conversations is not well correlated with \"social skills\".[1] HN has as strong knee jerk reaction when this book is mentioned, but in my experience, everyone who complained had not read the book, and almost all the complaints were semi-strawmen.reply",

You learn a bit more about the dynamics of conversations.This is the last thing I expected to find under a post about an SRS, but I think I\u2019ve just gone through this over the course of this year.

      "You may enjoy, It's not about the nail. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOgWhat I was doing is very common. Trying to engage logically with what logic can engage with, while failing to recognize that the emotional challenge is what has to be dealt with first. And that once feelings are out of the way, the logical problem will be massively easier to solve.reply",
      "It's important to remember there's no \"right\" or \"wrong,\" it's all about connection.If a stranger says, \"my bike tire is flat,\" in most western cultures, they might very well be asking for your help to reinflate their tire.If your loved one says the same, well you have a lot more context to fill in their subtext with. If they're displeased with your reasonable attempts to help them\u2014like you'd help a stranger\u2014it might mean that they were asking for something else. Finding out what that \"something else\" is, and adapting to each other's differences in \"what was said\" vs \"what was heard,\" is part of what it means to build a connection with someone.reply",
      "I feel you, I totally do. I get wanting to vent and wanting to be heard but solutions should come first. Honestly, when I hear people annoyed about offering solutions I get their need to engage with them differently but I also kind of believe they have a dysfunction about how they relate to the world.reply",
      "This attitude reminds me of another phrase that I've internalized.Choosing to be right, is choosing to be alone.Whatever you choose to put above trying to get along with others, limits who can be part of your group. In the extreme, you will feel absolutely justified. And yet be absolutely alone.As an example, language communities that focus on being able to find the ideal way to program (eg Lisp) tend to splinter. The languages that achieve broad acceptance (eg Python) do things that most people recognize as bad.This doesn't mean that we should always choose to get along, rather than being right. But failing to address emotions up front has damaged so many parts of my life, that I firmly wish that I hadn't stood for so long on how right my behavior was.I hope that your choices are working better for you than my past choices did for me.reply"

Are there any notes or the like that provide more insight?reply",
      "While I don't know much about Church numbers or the theory how lambda calculus works, taking a glance at the definitions on wikipedia they seem to be the math idea of how numbers works (at the meta level)I forgot the name of this, but they seem the equivalent of successors in math\nIn the low level math theory you represent numbers as sequences of successors from 0 (or 1 I forgot)Basically you have  one then sucessor of one which is two, sucessor of two and so on\nSo a number n is n successor operations from oneTo me it seems Church numbers replace this sucessor operation with a function but it's the same ideareply",
      "Church ends up defining zero as the identity function, and N as \"apply a function to a zero-unit N times\"While defining numbers in terms of their successors is decently doable, this logical jump (that works super well all things considered!) to making numbers take _both_ the successor _and_ the zero just feels like a great idea, and it's a shame to me that the papers I read from Church didn't intuit how to get there.After the fact, with all the CS reflexes we have, it might be ... easier to reach this definition if you start off \"knowing\" you could implement everything using just functions and with some idea of not having access to a zero, but even then I think most people would expect these objects to be some sort of structure rather than a process.There is, of course, the other possibility which is just that I, personally, lack imagination and am not as smart as Alonzo Church. That's why I want to know the thought process!reply",
      "Their structural properties are similar to Peano's definition in terms of 0 and successor operation. ChatGPT does a pretty good job of spelling out the formal structural connection\u00b9 but I doubt anyone knows how exactly he came up with the definition other than Church.\u00b9https://chatgpt.com/share/693f575d-0824-8009-bdca-bf3440a195...reply",

But after many, many of such purchases, I've learned my lesson.I buy it, I play with it a little bit, but the reality is my phone, iPad, or my laptop can do every single thing better.Maybe not with the same swagger. But ultimately, as I get older I realize I'm trying to produce with the least friction possible, and usually these devices have either highly constrained touch interfaces, shrunken keyboards, or both.I've always said that if somebody would create a new HP 200LX device with the same chicklet keyboard that I'd buy it in an instant.

      "I\u2019m currently working on an in house ERP and inventory system for a specific kind of business. With very few people you can now instead of paying loads of money for some off the shelf solution to your software needs get something completely bespoke to your business. I think AI enables the age of boutique software that works fantastically for businesses, agencies will need to dramatically reduce their price to compete with in house teams.I\u2019m pretty certain AI quadruples my output at least and facilitates fixing, improving and upgrading poor quality inherited software much better than in the past. Why pay for SaaS when you can build something \u201cgood enough\u201d in a week or two? You also get exactly what you want rather than some \u00a3300k per year CRM that will double or treble in price and never quite be what you wanted.reply",
      "> Why pay for SaaS when you can build something \u201cgood enough\u201d in a week or two?About a decade ago we worked with a partner company who was building their own in-house software for everything. They used it as one of their selling points and as a differentiator over competitors.They could move fast and add little features quickly. It seemed cool at first.The problems showed up later. Everything was a little bit fragile in subtle ways. New projects always worked well on the happy path, but then they\u2019d change one thing and it would trigger a cascade of little unintended consequences that broke something else. No problem, they\u2019d just have their in-house team work on it and push out a new deploy. That also seemed cool at first, until they accumulated a backlog of hard to diagnose issues. Then we were spending a lot of time trying to write up bug reports to describe the problem in enough detail for them to replicate, along with constant battles over tickets being closed with \u201cworks in the dev environment\u201d or \u201ccannot reproduce\u201d.> You also get exactly what you want rather than some \u00a3300k per year CRMWhat\u2019s the fully loaded (including taxes and benefits) cost of hiring enough extra developers and ops people to run and maintain the in house software, complete with someone to manage the project and enough people to handle ops coverage with room for rotations and allowing holidays off? It turns out the cost of running in-house software at scale is always a lot higher than 300K, unless the company can tolerate low ops coverage and gaps when people go on vacation.reply",
      "This is only true if you assume that you are producing the same amount of code as today. Though, AI ultimately will produce more code which will require higher maintenance. Your internal team will need to scale up due to the the amount of code they need to maintain. Your security team will have more work to do as well because they will need to review more code which will require scaling that team as well. Your infrastructure costs will start adding up and if you have any DevOps they will need scaling too.Soon or later the CTO will be dictating which projects can be vibe coded which ones make sense to buy.SaaS benefits from network effects - your internal tools don't. So overall SaaS is cheaper.The reality is that software license costs is a tiny fraction of total business costs. Most of it is salaries. The situation you are describing the kind of dead spiral many companies will get into and that will be their downfall not salvation.reply",

Entire industries got swallowed by software - retail, media, finance - you name it, there has been incredible disruption over the past couple of decades with a proliferation of SaaS tooling. This has led to a huge swath of SaaS companies - valued, collectively, in the trillions.In my last post debating if the cost of software has dropped 90% with AI coding agents I mainly looked at the supply side of the market. What will happen to demand for SaaS tooling if this hypothesis plays out? I've been thinking a lot about these second and third order effects of the changes in software engineering.The calculus on build vs buy is starting to change. Software ate the world. Agents are going to eat SaaS.The obvious place to start is simply demand starting to evaporate - especially for \"simpler\" SaaS tools. I'm sure many software engineers have started to realise this - many things I'd think to find a freemium or paid service for I can get an"

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become the object of desire for Big Tech, which is pouring astronomical sums into its development, fueled by record profits. The other side of this frenzy is workforce reductions, with automation as the backdrop, announced by multinationals like Amazon, Meta, and UPS, which, incidentally, threaten to extend the impact of new technologies to another area: public coffers. Fewer people working means fewer taxpayers, so the question naturally arises: if machines and algorithms replace humans in their jobs, should they also have to cover the taxes that humans stop paying?Labor, through income tax and social security contributions, is one of the pillars of the tax systems of almost all countries, and the impact of automation"
