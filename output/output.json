I've always thought it had a worthy place in the modern P2P conversation.In 2020, I messed around with a PoC for what hosting and distributing Linux distros could look like using WebTorrent[1].

      "I think we still have the same blocker as we had back when WebTorrent first appeared; browsers cannot be real torrent clients and open connections without some initial routing for the discovery, and they cannot open bi-directional unordered connections between two browsers.If we could say do peer discovery via Bluetooth, and open sockets directly from a browser page, we could in theory have local-first websites running in the browser, that does P2P connections straight between browsers.reply",

Many of the high-scale NoSQL system implementers have argued that the CAP theorem forces them to go with an eventual consistent model.    Mike challenges this assertion pointing that some common database errors are not avoided by eventual consistency and CAP really doesn\u2019t apply in these cases. If you have an application error, administrative error, or database implementation bug that losses data, then it is simply gone unless you have an offline copy.

      "By fixing a tiny machine class (say s=2,3; k=2) and exhaustively asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the fastest way any machine of this size can compute this function?\u201d, Wolfram is effectively mapping absolute speed limits within a constrained computational universe. That\u2019s not solving P vs NP, but it is answering a nearby, clean question: given a bounded program-size budget, what time-complexity phases actually occur, and which functions are forced into each phase?You can also read these experiments as a kind of \u201cfinite TTL\u201d study. Bound the algorithmic information content of the machine (number of states / rule bits), and measure how many steps (hops) you inevitably have to spend to transform input into output. Some functions admit linear-time realizations under that budget; some only quadratic; some only exponential. Even in these toy universes, there are intrinsic routing costs that no cleverness can remove without increasing the size of the machine.That feels very much in the ruliological spirit: instead of arguing in the abstract about \u201chardness\u201d in an infinite model, you enumerate a small slice of the Ruliad and see which notions of difficulty survive contact with explicit programs. Whether or not this ever touches the global P vs NP question, it gives a detailed picture of how computational irreducibility and speed limits show up in actually existing rule spaces, not just in asymptotic folklore.reply",

      "At some point, organisation can become a form of procrastination. Building a second brain is not Doing The Thing.[0]A note is not an intention. It commits to memory, not to action. I really don't care about having a whole searchable, tagged database; I hardly ever look at those notes again.At work I have topic-based Markdown notes. Sometimes I collect information about a topic for a few weeks or months, and eventually turn it into a proper guide (making guides is my job).I also LOVE paper notebooks, because they become a beautiful timeline of sketches, to-do lists, thoughts and plans. When I finish a notebook, I scan it then throw it in a drawer.I also use Obsidian daily notes to journal, mostly because it's easier to open an app than to write in a notebook. I don't do anything special with those notes, unless I'm trying to \"debug\" something happening in my life.[0] https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-...reply",
      "I don't really use \"second brain\" style notes and links for taking action. I use them to record something I think I might find interesting later, like a bookmark. I tag it and move on and later when enough time has passed, I search the notes by particular tag to see what things I recorded. Usually in that scenario, I actually will be in some mode where I'm trying take action. I'll often be looking for inspiration (say interesting UX design) and will have a ton of saved links and ideas to draw on. But I wouldn't say I'm writing these notes for particular action items.On the other hand, for work that I do day to day, I do take notes and those are a different type. Those are tied to actions I'm taking and I'll sprinkle them with actual to-do lists that I check off in the notes. I'll link ideas that are related and document things, but for my own projects, I don't try to make it too formal or strict. The notes aren't the goal, they're sort of a scratchpad for day to day operations.reply",
      "So here's what's worked for me over the years -I collect interesting links/pages/stuff by emailing myself notes about them. I never actually _do_ anything with these notes, but from time to time I open the \"Notes To Self\" folder and skim through them. Anything that seems worthless I delete, anything that seems obvious I delete, the rest just sit there.And that's more useful than you'd think - by reviewing them semi-regularly, you're indirectly memorizing their contents and refreshing their presence in your short term memory. And that to me is the benefit - not \"copy this cool thing\", but \"feed my mind cool ideas until it has digested them and incorporated them into the gestalt.reply",
      "I legitimately don't struggle with this. I have the \"root\" note which opens by default whenever I reset my Obsidian vault and it shows three lists:1. most recently updated notes2. most recently created notes3. notes I've added to my favouritesOn top of a search bar that doesn't suck, this is pretty much all I ever need.As for \"AI\", it's never going anywhere near my notes. It's supposed to be my second brain filled with content I've bothered to write down for myself. \"AI\" doesn't write it, \"AI\" doesn't process it, and I will never be convinced to change that. I use \"AI\" extensively, but this is a hard line that I will never cross.reply",
      "No, I do not have that issue. I process each note once and do not revisit it, which prevents clutter from accumulating. If a note needs to be retained or acted upon later, I convert it into a scheduled item in my tickler file and treat it as an explicit action rather than passive information.reply",
      "I work on a plugin/platform that makes Obsidian collaborative (relay.md).Working with other people gives you good habits against hording because you have a sense of the audience and what might be useful to them.We also support the kanban plugin so that works well to track and share what we're working on.reply",
      "Notes are options. Sometimes options for taking action later, sometimes as reference for related action. The bet when writing a note is that its risk adjusted return for those avenues is higher than the opportunity cost.I also have similar thoughts on turning writing into action and re-entrance, would be interested to hear your thoughts:https://blog.sao.dev/2025-threads/This has proven to work well for me, but I\u2019m chafing with git and agentic coding abstractions and looking for a unifying concept. Agent of empires doesn\u2019t feel quite right, but is in the right direction.reply",
      "While I do hoard notes I've realized over the years that the main reason I write notes is as a memory aid.  If I write it down I remember it better, and I'm more likely to do it.  Notes also act as a filter because I write stuff down, sometimes review the notes later, and decide what I wrote down isn't worth doing, so making a note of an idea essentially gives me a delay to review the idea and decide if it is worth doing.  I do also record links, keeping them in wiki pages (along with wiki pages for notes about various projects); I started doing that because browser histories today seem to autodelete old links.  Putting them into a wiki makes them searchable.  I keep journals as well, which are also searchable.  I don't necessarily want to be reminded of my notes and wiki/journal entries, I know they are there, I mainly want to call them up when I decide I need them.  That's the main drawback of paper notes, I can't search them.  I've tried scanning them, but it's tedious and they don't translate to ASCII text well, and drawings are not searchable.  I've considered using one of the e-paper notepads instead of paper notes, but I'd need a notepad handy in every room of the house and that would cost too much, and the procedures to automatically sync them to a central location don't seem very reliable (and I don't want to sync personal notes to some public cloud).So for me, an AI that suggests stuff would be annoying.  An AI that could take some vague search terms and my history and could pull old information out of notes that don't necessarily have the keywords I enter, using the context provided by my history might be useful.  So for example, I may remember I happened across a design for the DSP algorithms in guitar pedals, but the URL or note may not even mention DSP, so something that could turn a search for \"guitar pedal DSP\" into finding a link for an audio processing web page I visited would be useful.  The AI would probably have to scan all the web pages I visit to be able to store enough context to be useful for a search like that.  Doing this for 20 years or more might run into some scalability/cost issues.reply",
      "I think a super common problem with any todo system is the \"capture anything\" mindset.

Then, of all the \"oh I could/should do this\" potential tasks that occur to me, I have an out: if it doesn't align with my own personal focus, then I can delete it.reply",

      "That lesson plan is a good practical start.  I think it misses the very big picture of what we've created and the awesomeness of it.The simplest explanation I can give is we have a machine that you feed it some text from the internet, and you turn the crank.  Most machines we've had previously would stop getting better at predicting the next word after a few thousand cranks.  You can crank the crank on an LLM 10^20 times and it will still get smarter.  It will get so smart so quickly that no human can fit in their mind all the complexity of what it's built inside of it except through indirect methods but we know that it's getting smarter through benchmarks and some reasonably simple proofs that it can simulate any electronic circuit.  We only understand how it works by the smallest increment of its intelligence improvement and through induction understanding that that should lead to further improvements in its intelligence.reply",

It helps me. Don\u2019t know how you\u2019d introduce it, but with NST you have two objectives\u2014content loss and style loss\u2014and can see pretty quickly visually how the model balances between the two and where it fails.The bigger picture here is that people came up with a bunch of desirable properties they wanted to see and a way to automatically fulfill some of them some of the time by looking at lots of examples, and it\u2019s why you get a text box that can write like Shakespeare but can\u2019t tell you whether your grandma will be okay after she went to the hospital an hour ago.reply",

This makes them feasible to analyze with the tools of theory of mechanisms I believe.Also a really noteworthy insight I think he had was that when there is some kind of non-planar geometry arrangement of the wheels, that tends to create additional (perpendicular to surface) force on the wheels, effectively increasing the coefficient of friction. Think how a child may be able to climb a door frame by pressing hard enough on the sides.reply",

      "One thing that was unclear to me from the stats cited on the website is whether the quoted 52% reduction in crashes is when FSD is in use, or overall. This matters because people are much more likely to use FSD in situations where driving is easier. So, if the reduction is just during those times, I'm not even sure that would be better than a human driver.As an example, let's say most people use FSD on straight US Interstate driving, which is very easy. That could artificially make FSD seem safer than it really is.My prior on this is supervised FSD ought to be safer, so the 52% number kind of surprised me, however it's computed. I would have expected more like a 90-95% reduction in accidents.reply",

So most mail clients I've used don't load them by default for obvious privacy reasons.This got me thinking about the reverse, though: what email do I receive that does not include external images? And the answer is, mostly, email sent manually by a real human! I'm fairly certain I've never sent an email to another person in my personal life with an externally loaded image in it. When I have, it's been work email with a standard corporate email signature (that I'm sure was being tracked, natch).
