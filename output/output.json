      "We've got patches under review: https://inbox.sourceware.org/libc-alpha/cover.1722193092.git... (triggered by https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-42410, a graphics stack stability issue that wasn't as visible in RHEL 9 for some reason)At least the first one (the getenv thread safety fix) will hopefully make it into glibc 2.41 and it should be quite safe to backport.  It turns out that setenv is easier to handle because glibc already never frees environment strings.  It's concurrent unsetenv that is rather tricky.  Without some snapshot approach, getenv would return null pointers instead of environment variables values that are actually set.  I don't want to introduce locking into getenv because getenv without setenv has been async-signal-safe for so long that it would likely break applications.The environ handling fixes are a bit more controversial because vfork+execve make it complicated to avoid memory leaks, but these further fixes are less important to the stability of the graphics stack.\n \nreply",
      "What about using a linked list for variables added after the start of the process, which can be implemented atomically? Then once it gets \"too long\", a thread executing setenv could construct a new hashmap and replace the pointer to the old one with the pointer to the new one atomically, all without locking? To prevent two threads from rehashing at the same time, use an atomic flag for whether a thread is rehashing right now. That means if other threads call setenv in the meantime, the extra added variables would be appended to the list to be processed by a later setenv call (if one happens). That list could grow unbounded if enough threads call setenv quickly enough, but I think the simplicity of atomically swapping pointers might be worth it and setenv isn't called very frequently.\n \nreply",
      "I like this approach, because it lets everything Just Work without anyone outside of the implementation having to think about it at all, and only incurs meaningful overhead if you're doing something really silly, but crucially still won't break \u2014 it'll just be slightly slow. That feels like the right trade-off.\n \nreply",
      "As far as I'm concerned this is the only correct way to do it. I believe illumos does this, which is why its env functions are thread safe and have been for decades.\n \nreply",

      "This is great. I particularly liked this observation:> Shipping is a social construct within a company. Concretely, that means that a project is shipped when the important people at your company believe it is shipped.A lot of the ideas in here resonated with me a lot. This is the kind of article I wish I'd read before I spent a few years leading an engineering team at a medium-sized tech company!\n \nreply",
      "Ya, I think this is a great insight. In today's world, code is not released as a versioned artifact sold on a disc or downloaded. The idea of \"shipping\" is fuzzy. You might be 100% in production with some change and it could still leave edge case, deficiencies, etc. You can decide to address them now or later. And it's all just perception. You can say it's good enough, we shipped, let's forget about this whole thing and move to another. Or you can keep ironing out the quirks.I've \"shipped\" things in the past that were turned on to less than 1% of the time, and we left it at that, and moved on to other things. It was considered \"shipped\". Everyone was worried to increase it to beyond 1%, so we all patted ourselves in the back for the great launch and went to work on other things.\n \nreply",
      "This is the reality. And if you happen to be in an environment with less cooperative folks, get your requirements to ship in writing, agreed upon, and as up front as possible. Hold them to it. Otherwise, it just opens you up for nitpicking, and in some cases goalkeeping, by folks whom end up delaying your shipping.\n \nreply",
      "Ugh.This article is not about \u201cshipping\u201dsoftware.It\u2019s about pleasing upper management. Those are not the same things. The article even says it explicitly - if your users hate it and the market laughs, but executives like it, you\u2019ve shipped. If you\u2019ve given users the best software ever but your executive management doesn\u2019t know, or even actively hates it, you haven\u2019t shipped.Blech.\n \nreply",
      "I think the article does a very good job of defining the term \"shipping\" in the context of large organizations, where it you genuinely do need to please upper management - if you want further career advancement, in any case.It's a bit cynical, but that doesn't mean it's not true.If you want to ship software without worrying about upper management opinions, go work somewhere smaller.You can still please end-users AND upper management at the same time. That's what I would aspire to do in that situation.\n \nreply",
      "Yes this. Large orgs can just keep throwing mud on the wall until something sticks.If you're a smallco you don't have that tolerance on margin of error, small fuckups directly reflect on your pnl.\n \nreply",
      "I think this falls under the category of \"Don't hate the player, hate the game.\"I agree with you: It totally sucks that this is the way the business world works.But if you want to work within the confines of this flawed system, you need to know how to navigate it well, and I think this post does a good job of giving you the guided tour.There is a failsafe, however.  The post points out that if the project launches and users love it and it makes the company a ton of money, then upper management is going to find out about it even if you don't tell them, and they will be pleased that you have made the company a ton of money.\n \nreply",
      ">I think this falls under the category of \"Don't hate the player, hate the game.\"The game wouldn't be happening without players.\n \nreply",
      "There\u2019s a hero element here that so think is what irks me.The reality is, most of the time when you \u201cship\u201d your software, executive management neither notices nor cares. Even if you get the \u201cattaboy\u201d from a manager, they will forget it 10 minutes later.You ship your software because you care about work, and maybe because you care about your users. In a big software company, shipping is not going to get you noticed unless you are literally the guy delivering gmail or google maps.\n \nreply",
      "If a ship happens in the forest and nobody at company notices, did the ship really happen?To be clear, the pathway to management noticing is not you going around the building loudly blaring that you did a thing, it's that churn went down, or ARPU went up or CAC went down or uptime went up or something management cares about.But the essential thing to also understand is that this doesn't just happen for free. Figure out what metric your ship is meant to affect, put monitoring in place and proactively notify those above you about how your ship impacted that metric. If you don't do this last step, you didn't ship.\n \nreply"

I often get tapped to lead new ones when it\u2019s important to get it right, because I\u2019m good at it. Shipping in a big tech company is a very different skill to writing code, and lots of people who are great at writing code are terrible at shipping.Here\u2019s what I think about when I\u2019m leading a project and what I\u2019ve seen people get wrong.The most common error I see is to assume that shipping is easy. The default state of a project is to not ship: to be delayed indefinitely, cancelled, or to go out half-baked and burst into flames. Projects do not ship automatically once all the code has been written or all the Jira tickets closed. They ship because someone takes up the difficult and delicate job of shipping them.That means that in almost all cases, shipping has to come first. You cannot have anything else as your top priority.

      "I worked at Fairchild Sentry DTS in San Jose (at that time very close to the airport) circa 1984-1986 on the series 50 ATE. It was a beast. At the time it could clock & test up to 50MHz (hence the '50'). It was pretty much all ECL which would get very hot. Each unit shipped with a DEC VAX - that was my intro to VMS which had some interesting features like file versioning. I worked as a tech on the production floor building the 50. It was just being introduced and there were so many problems with getting them up and running. The systems had to be calibrated and that was done by changing the lengths of hundreds of delay wires on the backplane (in addition to digital delay-lines in the test head that could be automatically calibrated (over several hours) with the delay values being stored on disk). No two systems were exactly the same because of this (I'm sure this was also an issue with earlier ATE models as well). IIRC the 50 was \"introduced\" (announced) in '84 shortly before the time I started. I recall that we were way behind in producing them and there was lots of blame flying between production (us) and engineering - as in maybe they designed something that wasn't easily reproducible.In my next job I moved into an engineering role and I always kept that experience as a technician in the back of my mind: make sure what you're designing can be built with reproducible results.\n \nreply",
      "> We had to be careful about those AC utility jacks. The tester ground was at -11 volts at several hundred amps. If you clipped a scope to a ground, it would happily melt the insulation off the scope probe until it stunk up the room and pooled on the floor. We had to use a three-prong adapter with the ground cut off.You don't get this kind of excitement anymore with modern electronics.\n \nreply",
      "Not exactly this, but you can easily make big sparks and trip RCD (GFCI) breakers if you accidentally probe something with a grounded scope that isn't isolated. In the past we've used battery powered scopes to get around this (cutting the ground pin off anything isn't a good way to do things!)\n \nreply",
      "I have the same issue today when I fix old tube radios. Once side of the mains is connected to chassis -- and there are no polarized plugs. I use an isolation transformer, otherwise if I try to use a scope, I'd blow it out immediately--50% of the time.\n \nreply",

      "Author here. Thanks for reading this post. I had fun making this and thought the path that led me to this might be interesting for others.I\u2019m really interested in feedback and ideas on things I could improve and add. I found this really inspiring as it got me more into programming, discovering electronics, and 3d printing.I have no desire to ever make this project commercial, but it\u2019s been a great platform for me to learn and experiment new things so I\u2019ll take any idea be it for the gameplay or purely technical. Some features I have in mind are:- Multiplayer over bluetooth where one device is the \u2018game-master\u2019 running the exchange and can monitor and guide players while injecting events.- Additional quoting algos such as pegging one side of the order book and fighting for position- A tutorial and better UI. The game is hard to pick up for the first time and probably needs to be made more intuitive etc.While all of this was made with no practical use in mind (there are a lot of markets and products, and you\u2019d trade them in different ways, so you\u2019d need a different game to speak to a volatility trader for example), some people I work with at various trading desks found it useful for interviews or as an introduction to the idea of market-making for junior people.\n \nreply",

      "> But if I had any kind of point, it would probably be that spending the time to do things like write tools and explore the debugging space is pretty much always worth it.> Strangely, I've found that there is a not-insignificant number of people are against this - especially in a professional environment. I think this has something to do with the JIRA-fication of development process, where all work is divided and sub-divided, and anything that does not directly check a box and produce a deliverable is wasted effort. It's disheartening that there is a whole group of people - developers and managers alike - who do not understand or see the value in exploration as part of the process.So true, being able to create your own small tools is a superpower which is often at the heart of 10x programmers. It is sadly an art often practiced in the shadow.\n \nreply",
      "Recently at work I developed a small suite tools (in a mixture of python and shell, running in WSL) that left my boss impressed when he saw me debugging a customers system (IOT).Then he started asking me to make them accessible to non programmers, and suddenly those tools seemed a lot more than I bargained for.\n \nreply",
      "I've run into this as well.   There's a cog in the wheel developer and ... they have their place, and in many orgs they're the only thing that works.But if you're not that person (and I like to think I'm not) and you are curious and stop to think about second order effects, future features that are a little obvious, and so on ... it's really painful working with those developers who do not.I worked with one recently, not a bad person at all, but now I'm cleaning up his project that 100% did exactly what the tickets told him to do.   And the project that he worked on that was designed to replace a piece of software that had issues ... has every single issue the old one had for all the same reasons (someone coded it in the easiest possible way + only what the ticket told them to).So frustrating.I will say this though, I find the use of the term \"10x developer\" a sort of buzzword smell for the kind of reckless developer with no oversight who \"gets the job done\" at great cost ... because they can do what they want and then everything is siloed and potentially a disaster when anyone has to touch it or they bolt when it becomes clear their tower of cards is ready to come down.Not to say I disagree with your statement generally, just that term tends to make me worry.\n \nreply",
      "I'd say that there are two kinds of 10x devs, as per who is doing the determination of '10x':1. From the perspective of the money folks (managers & up): they get their jobs done very quickly, thus spending minimal time, meaning minimal money.2. From the perspective of excellent systems design folks: they design an excellent system that addresses subtle problems and foresees and addresses system problems that will occur down the road.Type #2 folks tend to not add to the org's technical debt; Type #1 folks don't GAF about such considerations -- they meet their quotas, get their perf reviews, and are on their way to their next promotion/position/project.I'd say there is excellence for excellence's sake, and then there's money-making excellence. Sure, orgs need to make money (or at least break even) to survive, but there's a lot of overlap where being too much one way or the other will be an impediment to long-term viability.\n \nreply",

      "Be careful about generalizing about Boeing here; it's not really a good example. The door plug incident was entirely caused by managers, not bad engineering.In this case, the managers knew that if they went back and removed the door plug then it would have to be inspected again. That would cost time, and the plane was already behind schedule. Their bonuses were in the line, so they got together to find a solution. The solution that they found was to skirt the inspection rules using semantics. They decided to have their employees loosen the bolts, shift the door plug a little, do the required work, and then put everything back. This allowed them to claim with a straight face that they hadn't \u201dremoved\u201d the door plug, and therefore it didn't need to be inspected.\n \nreply",

      "I don\u2019t think that this algorithm can handle slash chords like G/C (G over C) and would instead label it as Gsus4. The former gives a lot of important context to voicing which can by important if you need a particular sort of motion in the bass line.My hunch is that any algorithm  that analyzes chords in isolation (and not in the context of other chords in the song) is going to miss out on overall readability. Good chord notation has a sort of elegance that can highlight the similarities/differences between sequential chords that can make things very intuitive for the musician\n \nreply",
      "The algorithm makes several false assumptions AND misses some crucial points about harmony that affect chord naming. One of each below:- Chords are definitely not always built on thirds. Mainly the traditional western sounds are.- Even more importantly, chords are never named in isolation, they are named with respect to their musical context. An Am7 could more correctly be called a C/A depending on the overall harmonic picture - the melody, the chords before and after and even the emphasis created by the performing musicians. Voicings are basically ignored but could be said to come under this point.When I teach harmony to students I always point out the key thing to understand is how the harmony is changing, and to look at it dynamically not statically. It's more about the relative motion of notes comprising chords than names although names are obviously a useful construct.\n \nreply",
      "I agree with you but I wonder if this algorithm could be reworked to be an important part of a system of that considers context.Roughly, what if we consider x_i the sequence of latent chords, and y_i the observed notes. If we reframe the accidental-based sorting this uses to act like a likelihood function e.g. P(y_i | x_i) ~= 1/exp(# accidentals), then we \"only\" need a transition function P(x_i | x_i-1) which describes what chords typically follow which preceding chords, and then we have an HMM system for which we can do inference easily. You can also imagine extending the order (number of preceding chords regarded as context), or training some higher order latent state z which might carry information about mood or genre and what chord sequences are appropriate in context e.g. P(y) = P(z_0) \\Product P(z_i | x_i-1, z_i-1) P(x_i|z_i) P(y_i|x_i)\n \nreply",
      "> My hunch is that any algorithm that analyzes chords in isolation (and not in the context of other chords in the song)You can at least get much further by naming a key (what a key is, is not etched in stone either, but there are some useful enough definitions for most cases). That would be a bare minimum for a useful algorithm though.\nEspecially if your input is just a set of notes.\n \nreply",
      "And then the key may be unclear, or musicians may differ as to where they feel, say, modulations occur: \"it clearly modulates in measure six\" \"no, measure six is just a borrowed chord and the real modulation is at the cadence in measure eight\" etc.\n \nreply",
      "Naming a key seems, at the very least, a better way to decide the root note than counting accidentals; but which chords are the preferred, common ones isn't completely clear-cut.\n \nreply",
      "Sometimes the context even includes the genre. A F/G might be written G9sus4 on a jazz lead sheet or G11 for a pop song. The latter is somewhat incorrect, since the 3rd is pretty important in a G11 voicing.Without other context I would say that you can probably label G/C as Cmaj9 or even Cadd9, even though the E was not in the original label, but to be sure you do need to check whether the E is indeed okay instead of or in addition to the B.\n \nreply",
      "What\u2019s more functionally F[maj7]/G\u00b9 is functionally a G7 chord in that any place you see the one you can substitute the other and the harmonic function remains the same.\u2e3b1. This chord and its relatives in other keys is my favorite chord.\n \nreply",
      "Kind of since you don't have the B-F tritone. There is a lot more instability, and the resolution to C is a lot stronger, in G7 than in F/G or similar chords.\n \nreply",
      "Yes.[1] In particular your point about analyzing chords in isolation is spot on.In \u201cAn Introduction to Musical Analysis\u201d[2], Nicholas Cook says something that I have always considered very profound and applies widely, not just in music, which is   > All notation is analysis\n\nSo whenever you write something down in music you are (of course) making some simplifications and you are also doing it for a particular purpose. Usually the purpose is performance. So when you write something you are providing an instruction to the performer.So when you write Cma7 for a jazzer, that\u2019s an instruction that you are generally in the major tonal area and they may well play a Cma9 or a Cma7#11 for example.  This is why my functional harmony teacher used to get annoyed by people writing the \u201cCrosstown Traffic\u201d/\u201cPurple Haze\u201d Hendrix chord as E7#9 (which you see a lot). He would say it is E7b10 because that g natural is coming from the minor modes so it\u2019s actually the fourth degree which has been flattened.  If you call it a #9 you\u2019re telling players the wrong scale for improvisation (pretty much everyone else in the whole world calls it E7#9 though).Likewise going back to your point about slash chords, a lot of people learning this stuff get hung up on \u201cwhat is this slash chord really?\u201d (Eg if I\u2019ve got B/C or whatever what actually is that) whereas when I\u2019ve talked to really serious musicians in that world who play that kind of intense modal music they really are thinking about what the slash chords are in terms of where they come from and what they are leading to. Because that gives a sense for what the underlying tonality is.  You can\u2019t get it just from the notes of the chord vertically in that one instant.If you look at baroque music and earlier, if you just do a vertical chord analysis (eg something like Gesualdo if you really want an extreme example) the chords make absolutely no sense in many cases but that\u2019s because they work in terms of voice leading (ie context) rather than vertical relationships.  Analysts used to call that feature \u201cvertical false relations\u201d because they found the vertical chord analysis troubling.[1] ex-professional musician with a degree and postgrad in jazz, contemporary and popular music here. Wife is a professional musician who teaches at a couple of conservatoires and mostly plays baroque and early music with some 20th and 21st C music thrown in for good measure.  Lots of pro musician friends.  Not trying to argue purely from authority but I do talk music a lot with people who know a lot, and this topic comes up a lot.[2] Which stands out as a great book in a field with lots of terrible books btw.\n \nreply"

These could be sold as the original, since everyone knew it had been stolen, and each would think they had the real one. Then the original is returned, and the buyers are without recourse.

Security in the museum was lax, so the man found it easy to stow away inside a storage closet.

At around 7:15 a.m., he emerged clad in a white apron\u2014the same garment worn by the museum\u2019s employees.
