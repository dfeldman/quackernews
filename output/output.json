      "> The PlayStation 2\u2019s library is easily among the best of any console ever released, and even if you were to narrow down the list of games to the very best, you\u2019d be left with dozens (more like hundreds) of incredible titles.  But the PS2 hardware is getting a bit long in the toothBesides the library, the PS2 is the most successful video game console of all time in terms of number of units shipped, and it stayed on the market for over ten years, featured a DVD drive, and at one point was positioned by Sony not just as an entertainment appliance but as a personal computer, including their own official PS2 Linux distribution.In a more perfect world, this would have:(a) happened with a hypothetical hardware platform released after the PS2 but before the PS3, with specs lying in between the two: a smidge better than the former, but not quite as exotic as the latter (with its Cell CPU or the weird form factor; whereas the PS2's physical profile in comparison was perfect, whether in the original form or the Slim version), which could have:(b) resulted in a sort of standardization in the industry like what happened to the IBM PC and its market of clones, with other vendors continuing to manufacture semi-compatible units even if/when Sony discontinued it themselves, periodically revving the platform (doubling the amount of memory here, providing a way to tap into higher clock speeds there) all while maintaining backwards compatibility such that you would be able to go out today and buy a brand new, $30 bargain-bin, commodity \"PS2 clone\" that can do basic computing tasks on it (in other words, not including the ability to run a modern Web browser or Electron apps), can play physical media, and supports all the original games and any other new games that explicitly target(ed) the same platform, or you could pay Steam Machine 2026 prices for the latest-gen \"PS2\" that retains native support for the original titles of the very first platform revision but unlocks also the ability to play those for every intermediate rev, too.reply",

And 4G cell phones like the https://lilygo.cc/products/t-deck-pro are available on the market built around the very similar ESP32.  The latest greatest will always be behind a paywall, but the rising tide floats all boats, and hobbyist projects are growing more sophisticated.  Even a $1 ESP32 has dual 240mhz 32bit cores, 8Mb ram, and fast network interfaces which blow away the 8bit micros I grew up with.  The state of the open-source art may be a bit behind the state of the proprietary arts, but is advancing as well.It's really fun to have useful hardware that's easy to program at the bare metal.reply",

      "chipfoundry.io charges $14,950 for 100 chips.  As far as small batch manufacturing goes, that's reasonably affordable.  $149 ea.  Occasionally I see better deals crop up as part of group buys.  Presumably, one would prototype their design on an inexpensive FPGA board first, to verify functionality.  So as to be reasonably sure the first batch of chips worked.

      "Now I can't stop thinking about _The Experience Machine_ by Andy Clark. It theorizes that this is how humans navigate and experience the real world: Our brains generate what we think the world around is like and our senses don't so much directly process visual information but instead act like a kind of loss function for our internal simulations. Then we use that error to update our internal model of the world.In this view, we are essentially living inside a high-fidelity generative model. Our brains are constantly 'hallucinating' a predicted reality based on past experience and current goals. The data from our senses isn't the source of the image; it's the error signal used to calibrate that internal model. Much like Genie 3 uses latent actions and frames to predict the next state of a world, our brains use 'Active Inference' to minimize the gap between what we expect and what we experience.It suggests that our sense of 'reality' isn't a direct recording of the world, but a highly optimized, interactive simulation that is continuously 'regularized' by the photons hitting our retinas.reply",

Back in 2013, when my grandmother moved into the then-new house, I setup a point-to-point wifi bridge between them to share my parents' Internet connection and give me easy remote support access to grandma.Summer of 2023 visiting relatives complained the Internet service in grandma's house was slow and unreliable. There were repeated suggestions made by helpful relatives for purchasing a new WiFi router for her house, getting independent Internet service, etc.Grandma was happy with it, and the relatives went home, so I put off looking at it. When I did finally look at it, months later (when I went over for Thanksgiving) everything seemed fine.When the relatives came to visit in summer 2024 they complained again. I looked at it immediately and found massive packet loss on both ends.The ornamental trees planted along the driveway between the houses were the culprit. With the leaves off (say, at Thanksgiving time) it was fine. When the relatives came to visit in the summer the trees were in full leaf and acting as very good attenuators.The trees were newly planted when grandma moved in. I didn't even think about them getting bigger and fuller when I set up the link. They filled out in the 10 years intervening, though. (Chalk it up to me still being relatively young and not thinking about installations on 10+ year timescales when I put it up.)Fortunately there's a room in her house with line of sight to my parents' house unobscured by trees. It meant putting the radio outside a bedroom window instead of the attic (where I'd originally stashed it), but it solved the problem and ended complaints from relatives.reply",

It wasn't until MacOS Tahoe that Apple's own screen capture on Mac started supporting HDR. Windows 10/11, AFAIK, only supports HDR through the XBox Game Bar's capture.

Building on established infrastructure makes sense when you're solving the coordination problem of getting all agents to adopt the same communication standard. Rather than waiting for consensus on new protocols, using email lets agents participate in workflows immediately.reply",
      "I'm 100% for this, but I think you can go even more granular than \"gives agents their own inboxes\".Thanks to Action Mailbox in Rails[1], I give all my records email addresses. Eg let ecommerce \"order\" records accept forwarded emails that are pinned as comments. It opens you up for doing things like forwarding a purchase order and having the PO number pulled out and attached to an order, or forwarding tracking information from a supplier and having it attached to a \"supplier order\" etc.In my personal life I have individual email addresses for all my utilities and emails automatically get filed away.If this idea tickles your fancy, I opensourced Emitt[2], an inbound email processing server with LLM-powered automation.1. https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailbox_basics.html2. https://github.com/schappim/emittreply",

      "I'm concerned that this fits in \"using today's innovation to solve outdated paradigms\".Google has A2A: An Agent-to-Agent Protocol. SaaS is plumetting in value.Arbitrary semantics made sense when communications were human-dominated.If agents dominate these fields, why wouldn't they simply set their own protocols and methods to communicate both text, binary, and agreed data structures?There's an assumption that email is somehow the best channel, when you've found yourself that the most popular, functional interfaces don't align with your expectations.Then, ultimately I have a single agent that can sit in numerous communication platforms, such as emailreply",
      "Fair concern, and I agree on the end state. Agents will eventually use native agent-to-agent protocols.The question is the transition, because email is undoubtedly the most ubiquitous channel of communication in today. I would only give my agent an A2A integration if your agent has an A2A integration, but because you don't we are at a stalemate. I'd rather just give my agent an inbox where I know it can communicate with the other billions of people that already have an email address.Email isn\u2019t the final protocol for agents.

This is an infinite whack-a-mole.do you guys have some ways of handling it?reply",
      "We do have robust checks in place to catch spam and bad actors(reputation, SPF DKIM DMARC, etc.) but as with all tools there will be bad actors who come up with creative ways to scheme for nefarious purposes.We expect our infra and policies to evolve with usage, and one of our goals is to make agent driven email safer than the status quo, not just more scalablereply",

Looks like you have no idea about any of this. You don't even have knowledge of email reputation, much less a plan. Have you heard of Senderscore? You will have all zeros. Saying \"SPF DKIM DMARC\" is wild - that's a checklist from 15 years ago.reply",
      "I think we\u2019re aligned on the hard parts here, so let me be precise.We\u2019re not wide open for abuse nor are we bypassing the hard parts of email reputation. Quite the opposite. We also utilize SES's infrastructure and monitor reputation continuously, but we don\u2019t assume SPF/DKIM/DMARC are sufficient on their own. They\u2019re basics we have implemented, not the entire strategy.You are correct private IPs per customer make sense once you\u2019re sending meaningful volume (on the order of ~10k+/day per IP). But its inaccurate to say we are sending from a single private IP. IP pools are typically segmented by reputation and traffic profile for customers.Reputation here is earned at multiple layers: per-IP, per-domain, per-inbox, and over time. We rate-limit, isolate, or revoke bad actors without poisoning unrelated senders. Hopefully this makes sense.reply"

      "I happened to have participated in census work before. For instance, in a country like China, the national census conducted every ten years generally yields accurate overall data, but the data for individual regions is indeed based on estimates. There are several reasons for this:1. Population Mobility: Generally speaking, in economically developed areas, population figures are often underestimated because a large number of people freely migrate into these regions, and local governments are actually unclear about the exact increase in population. In contrast, in less economically developed areas, population figures are often overestimated because many people leave to work in cities, only returning to their hometowns for brief periods each year.2. Mortality Data: China\u2019s birth data is already quite accurate. Nowadays, the vast majority of babies are born in hospitals, unlike decades ago when midwives would come to homes to assist with deliveries. Moreover, birth certificates must be issued immediately after a baby is born. However, China\u2019s mortality data is not precise, primarily because burials are still common in many rural areas, and these death records are often delayed.For example, my city conducted multiple rounds of mass COVID-19 testing in 2021.  Each time, more than 4.4 million people were tested, but our small city's 2020 census results only showed a population of 3.7 million.reply",

      "The thing is, even if the market bursts, prices are already inflated.  RAM manufacturers know that everything 5xed and they aren't likely going to rush out and drop the price levels to pre-expansion.  Once the AI market bursts, you can expect slow and methodical decreases in price (if any).And that will ultimately buy China a lot of time to shove their ram into the market cutting ram manufacturers out of most non-US markets.I think the major memory manufacturers are simply banking on their ability to flood the market if worst comes to worse.  That or I could see some standards trickery around DDR6 (or some new BS standard).  It'd not shock me if they coordinated with AMD/Intel to keep the standard secret as long as possible simply give themselves a lead in production.reply",

      "From the Waymo blog...> the pedestrian suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle's path. Our technology immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle. The Waymo Driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.> Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene.> Following the event, we voluntarily contacted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that same day.I honestly cannot imagine a better outcome or handling of the situation.reply",
      "Yup. And to add> Waymo said in its blog post that its \u201cpeer-reviewed model\u201d shows a \u201cfully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.\u201dIt's likely that a fully-attentive human driver would have done worse. With a distracted driver (a huge portion of human drivers) it could've been catastrophic.reply",
      "If you drive in Sweden you will occasionally come up to a form of speed reduction strategy that may seem counterintuitive. They all add to make driving harder and feel more dangerous in order to force attention and lower speed.One is to merge opposite directional roads into a single lane, forcing drivers to cooperate and take turn to pass it, one car at a time.For a combined car and pedestrian road (max speed of 7km/h) near where I live, they intentionally added large obfuscating objects on the road that limited visibility and harder to navigate. This forces drivers to drive very slow, even when alone on the road, as they can't see if a car or person may be behind the next object.In an other road they added several tight S curves in a row, where if you drive anything faster than 20km/h you will fail the turns and drive onto the artificial constructed curbs.In other roads they put a sign in the middle of two way roads while at the same time drastically limiting the width to the curb, forcing drivers to slow down in order to center the car in the lane and squeeze through.In each of those is that a human driver with human fear of crashing will cause drivers to pay extra attention and slow down.reply",
      "In Bulgaria we have a similar speed reduction strategy but we are a bit ahead of Sweden:\nWe use medium-radius but very deep potholes. If you lose attention for even a split second, you are forced to a full stop to change a tire.\nNear schools it gets more \"advanced\": they put parked cars on both sides of the road, and the holes positioned so you can't bypass them. For example, two tire-sized holes on both sides of the road right next to the parked cars. You have to come to a complete stop, then slowly descend into the hole with the front wheels, climb back out, and repeat the process for the rear wheels. Occasionally, even though we (technically) have sidewalks, they are covered in mud or grass or bushes, so pedestrians are forced to walk in the middle of the road. This further reduces driving speed to walking pace and increases safety in our cities. Road markings are missing almost everywhere and they put contradicting road signs so drivers are not only forced to cooperate but also to read each other minds.reply",
      "Same in India! We go one better, we let people drive in the opposite lane as well!reply",

      "It's fairly common at least in the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland too. In Switzerland they also place street parking spots on alternating sides on narrow streets, which also makes you more attentive and lower your speed.reply",

Nearly 20 years ago now it saved me from a night of awful sleep. My backpacking buddy and I had just arrived in Liverpool with an early Ryanair flight out the following morning, and no hostel reservations. We'd been traveling successfully without reservations for a bit, but it turned out there was some kind of event that weekend in Liverpool and there was absolutely nowhere to stay (or at least, nothing that cost less than, like, the budget for our entire trip).We decided we'd just stay out late, then go to the airport and wait it out for our flight. After some effort trying to sleep on hard plastic benches in the airport Burger King (where Michael Jackson's Thriller was playing loudly on repeat, I do not know why), I pulled out my 12\" PowerBook and found out via that site that the airport had a meditation room with dim lighting, soft carpet, and no Michael Jackson.

Try RSS for news/blogs, take some time (preferably offline) each week to prepare for the important events in the upcoming week(s), write them down on something you pass by every day (such as a whiteboard near your front door).reply",
      "I'll suggest an approach that works for me.Ask yourself what it is you're actually doing / attending to / accomplishing, with regard to whatever notification you happen to see. Then identify similar ones; group them together; and work on that group at repeated intervals. It should feel like boring maintenance work \u2014 because the goal is to make work predictable in order to predictably achieve the outcomes you desire (and then to automate the work, if you want, to free up your time). This also helps to identify low-value types of activities and then deprioritize or eliminate them.By way of your example, I want to take certain actions regarding special days involving people who are important to me (birthdays, holidays, anniversaries \u2026). So periodically I attend to that because it's important. (Maybe that means I plan things out every week, or every month \u2014 up to you. And then the planned tasks \u2014 calling my buddy, shopping for gifts, writing and mailing cards \u2014 go on the calendar as planned work.) It's during that work period that I see triggers / upcoming items related to that group of items. Why would I want notifications or other interruptions about them any other time? Answer: only for things that are true emergencies. Maybe you should have a yearly repeating 15-minute calendar entry to call your friend on their birthday. (You are working from your calendar, right?)The other tip I can offer is to do yesterday's incoming work today, and today's incoming work tomorrow. This lets you strategically plan how you will handle all of today's work instead of getting interrupted by it today and bouncing around trying to deal with it. Moreover, very few things need to be done immediately; many problems solve themselves with time; and sleeping on things can shift a large chunk of the time-consuming processing involved with it to your subconscious mind. (Furthermore, the habit of planning your work in advance and addressing it methodically is going to drastically reduce the number of true emergencies and even typical interruptions that you'll feel the need to deal with. It's a virtuous cycle.)I'll leave you with the notions that practically everything is unimportant when you consider its place in the incalculable vastness of the universe; you never get your time back; and your health is of paramount importance.P.S.: I somehow missed that you had the birthday on your calendar. This tells me that either you're not working from your calendar (big problem) or else you added the birthday as an all-day event instead of an appointment (\"I will call my friend on their birthday every year at 12 PM and catch up for 15 minutes\").reply"
