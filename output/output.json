      "I think Prop79 will be good long term but it will take decades for the changes to be felt. I hope that something with a bit more immediate shows up this year as well. Relooking at prop 13 seems to be one option.reply",
      "SB79 is a great step forward for California. Hopefully other states implement similar (and more aggressive) bills in their states. My dream world would see an elimination of local zoning as we do in the US, and a move to a zoning system more like the Japanese use. I would also love to see states adopt a Land-Value Tax to help incentivize development. Similar to SB79 I have always hoped for a bill that enforced something like within 1 mile of a school, all roads need to have cross walks, lights, and side walks to help kick start walkability in the US.reply",

So, as revolutions in housing go, this is slow-burn.Needed, won't fix housing next month or even next year.Sometimes I wonder if a state went out and bought the input supply stocks (wood, particleboard, roofing materials) and sold them below cost at the longer base-line price, but exclusively to builders constructing homes, if they could prevent a grey market re-sale to the less housing oriented market. The problem with trying to drag supply prices back down is making secondary markets between your rate, and the market rate.I am not believing there is an actual shortage worldwide of either construction grade lumber, or other inputs: Its shipping related, its logjams backing up because .. well .. the wheels fell off at the start of 2020 and we haven't got momentum back up.Oh right. Ships. So maybe the state has to buy ships.. which demands steel.. which is hard to get right now...reply",

      "I mean, it was 16,000-18,000 homes that were destroyed? That's a hell of a lot when you consider that all the other new builds are still in the queue to be permitted too.reply",
      "These are not hard things to understand or solve, it's just that the majority of people don't want to understand them or face reality and the politicians will always serve up these kinds of con artist lies to placate people.You cannot add ~60 million foreign national people to the US population in the last 25 years without severely impacting the housing situation when the USA has only built 1.1 million housing units on average over that period; most of those being locked into high prices due to  the massive inflation over that time.What makes it even worse is this obsession with both concentrating populations and jobs in urban centers, while at the same time being concerned with climate change and environmental protection. They are mutually exclusive things. This is an iron triangle issue, you can only have two of three things: affordable housing, immigration, climate/environment protection.reply",

      "While WireGuard makes every sense for an FPGA due to its minimal design, I wonder why there isn't much interest in using QUIC as a modern tunneling protocol, especially for corporate use cases. QUIC already provides an almost complete WireGuard-alternative via its datagrams that can be easily combined with TUN devices and custom authentication schemes (e.g. mTLS, bearer tokens obtained via OAuth2 and OIDC authentication, etc...) to build your own VPN. While I am not sure about performance, at least when compared to kernel-mode WireGuard, since QUIC is obviously a more complex state machine that's running in userspace and it depends on the implementation and optimizations offered by the OS (e.g. GRO/GSO), QUIC isn't just a yet another tunneling protocol, it actually offers lots of benefits such as working well with dynamic endpoints with DNS instead of just using static IP addrs, it uses modern TLSv1.3 and therefore it's compliant with FIPS for example, it uses AES which can be accelerated by the underlying hardware (e.g. AES-NI), it currently has implementations in almost every major programming language, it can work well in the future with proxies and load balancers, you can bring your own custom, more fine-grained authentication scheme (e.g. bearer tokens, mTLS, etc...), it masquerades as just another QUIC/HTTP3 traffic that's used by almost all major websites now and therefore less susceptible to dropping by any nodes in between, and other less obvious benefits such as congestion control and PMTUD.reply",

      "It's not about performance, of course. It's about looking like HTTPS, being impenetrable, separating the ad-hoc transport encryption and the Wireguard encryption which also works as authentication between endpoints, and also not being not TCP inside TCP.reply",
      "You can just do that by using QUIC-based tunneling directly instead of using WireGuard-over-QUIC and basically stacking 2 state machines on top of one another.reply",
      "TCP over Wireguard is two state machines stacked on each other.  QUIC over Wireguard is the same thing.  Yet, both seems to work pretty well.I think I see your argument, in that it's similar to what sshuttle does to eliminate TCP over TCP through ssh.  sshuttle doesn't prevent HOL blocking though.reply",
      "TCP over WireGuard is unavoidable because that's the whole point of tunneling. But TCP over WireGuard over QUIC just doesn't make any sense, neither from performance nor from security perspective. Not to mention that with every additional tunneling layer you need to reduce the MTU (which is already a very restricted sub-1500 value without tunneling) of all inner tunnels.reply",

      "Currently a one-man side project:\nhttps://laboratory.loveLast year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods\u2014including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its \u201csafe\u201d BPA limit by 20,000\u00d7, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100\u00d7 higher than Europe\u2019s new standard.That seemed solvable.Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports \u00d7 Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid\u2019s snacks, or whatever you\u2019re curious about.Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn\u2019t reach its goal within 365 days, you\u2019re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly.We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open.Since last month\u2019s \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d post:- 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!)- That\u2019s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates)- 6 results published, 4 in progressThe goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift.Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along:\n https://laboratory.lovereply",
      "1. An example result is \"https://laboratory.love/product/117\", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly \"best\"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level?2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will?3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6?4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them?5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit?  Could the labs be?reply",
      "It's sad that it's come to this on needing to test these things, but amazing initiative! Would love something like this where I am.reply",
      "Where are you? This project is not necessarily limited to products that are available in the United States. Anything that can be shipped to the United States is still testable.reply",
      "In New Zealand, but just thinking about some of the items that wouldn't be able to be shipped to the US.reply",
      "First of all, really cool initiative!It's interesting that a bunch of the funded products have been funded by a single person.Do you know if it's the producers themselves? Worried rich people?reply",
      "Given the current reach of the project (read: still small!), I suspect for awhile yet the majority of successfully funded testing will be by concerned individuals with expendable income. It is cheaper and much faster to go through laboratory.love than it would be to partner with a lab as an individual (plus the added bonus that all data is published openly).I've yet to have any product funded by a manufacturer. I'm open to this, but I would only publish data for products that were acquired through normal consumer supply chains anonymously.reply",
      "I think this concept has legs to be much bigger than just foods. There are lots of influencer types who focus on testing.For example, there are two individuals who own the same $100k machine for testing the performance of loudspeakers.https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.phphttps://www.erinsaudiocorner.com/Both of them do measurements and YouTube videos. Neither one has a particularly good index of their completed reviews, let alone tools to compare the data.I wish I could subscribe to support a domain like \u201cloud speaker spin tests\u201d and then have my donation paid out to these reviewers based on them publishing new high quality reviews with good data that is published to a common store.reply",
      "For fun, playing with Meshtastic https://meshtastic.org/ and contributing to the open source firmware and apps. They have something cool but need lots of help. I've patched 3 memory leaks and had a few other PRs merged already.For work, https://heyoncall.com/ as the best tool for on-call alerting, website monitoring, cron job monitoring, especially for small teams and solo founders.I guess they both fall under the category of \"how do you build reliable systems out of unreliable distributed components\" :)reply",
      "I've become a bit addicted to online education.  I finished my first masters degree in Computer Science in July, and I started a masters in Mathematics from The Open University at the beginning of October.  I've wanted to really get into the weeds of obscure and arguably-useless math for about as long as I can remember, and I figure that getting a masters in it is as good a way to get that knowledge as any way else.Other than that, I've been doing a lot of fixing of tech debt in my home network from the last six years.  I've admittedly kind of half-assed a lot of the work with my home router and my server and my NAS and I want these things to be done correctly. (In fairness to me, I didn't know what I was doing back when I started, and I'd like to think I know a fair bit better now).For example, when I first built my server, I didn't know about ZFS datasets, so everything was on the main /tank mount.  This works but there are advantages to having different settings for different parts of the RAID and as such I've been dividing stuff into datasets (which has the added advantage of \"defragging\" because this RAID has grown by several orders of magnitude and as a result some of the initial files were fragmented).reply"

This approach enables AI models to run locally on devices with limited computational resources, providing real-time inference capabilities without requiring constant internet connectivity.(This isn't necessarily just Microsoft's definition - https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/edge-computing/what-is-edge... from 2023 defines edge computing as on-device as well, and is cited in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing#cite_note-35)I suppose that the definition \"edge is anything except a central data center\" is consistent between these two approaches, and there's overlap in needing reliable ways to deploy code to less-trusted/less-centrally-controlled environments... but it certainly muddies the techniques involved.At this rate of term overloading, the next thing you know we'll be using the word \"edgy\" to describe teenagers or something...reply",

      "By \"asserting X\" do you mean \"checking whether X is true and crashing the program if not\", like the assert macro in C or the assert statement in Python?  No, that is almost never done, for three reasons:\u2022 Crashing the program is often what you formally verified the program to prevent in the first place!  A crashing program is what destroyed Ariane 5 on its maiden flight, for example.  Crashing the program is often the worst possible outcome rather than an acceptable one.\u2022 Many of the assumptions are not things that a program can check are true.  Examples from the post include \"nothing is concurrently modifying [variables]\", \"the compiler worked correctly, the hardware isn't faulty, and the OS doesn't mess with things,\" and, \"unsafe [Rust] code does not have [a memory bug] either.\"  None of these assumptions could be reliably verified by any conceivable test a program could make.\u2022 Even when the program could check an assumption, it often isn't computationally feasible; for example, binary search of an array is only valid if the array is sorted, but checking that every time the binary search routine is invoked would take it from logarithmic time to linear time, typically an orders-of-magnitude slowdown that would defeat the purpose of using a binary search instead of a simpler sequential search.  (I think Hillel tried to use this example in the article but accidentally wrote \"binary sort\" instead, which isn't a thing.)When crashing the program is acceptable and correctness preconditions can be efficiently checked, postconditions usually can be too.  In those cases, it's common to use either runtime checks or property-based testing instead of formal verification, which is harder.reply",
      "That\u2019s impractical. Take binary search and the assumption the list is sorted. Verifying the list is sorted would negate the point of binary search as you would be inspecting every item in the list.reply",
      "ASSERTING the list is sorted as an assumption is significantly different form VERIFYING that the list is sorted before executing the search. Moreover, type systems can track that a list was previously sorted and maintained it's sorted status making the assumption reasonable to state.reply",
      "What do you mean when you say \"assert\" and \"verify\"? In my head, given the context of this thread and the comment you're replying to, they can both only mean \"add an `if not sorted then abort()`.\"But you make some sort of distinction here.reply",

      "(i'm the author) thanks for posting OP! here's the youtube full playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQz-PgA1eJw&list=PLcfpQ4tk2k...more thoughts after about 6 months of stewing with the Tiny Teams idea:the more work experience I have in tech, the more I see the inverse relationship between size of team and velocity on projects. I think Zuck aside, the race towards 10-20mm comp packages (this is real btw) for high velocity AI engineers (both the kind that are very good at using coding agents and the kind that ship AI products) is a direct economic consequence of this very human observation meshed with the reduction in cost of shipping software as long as you have a very good supervisor/prompter/architect to keep things on rails.I actually think the biggest casualty of this is 1) people with \"bullshit jobs\" in tech e.g. \"product managers\" that are actually \"project managers\" that call in on zoom from their poolside to ask \"ok what's your ETA on that?\" on their jira board twice a week, and 2) the VC industry since (if you dont pay a ton of cash comp) companies are close to profitable (https://www.swyx.io/cognition) after an initial ramp due to the insane labor leverage. the one-and-done round i think is going to be increasingly common in VC.reply",

This is far from ideal for sleep, meditation, etc. So this is an enhancement request, if your app doesn't already solve this ;)I'm also curious: do you think that the cost of maintaining the app (keeping it up to date with newer iOS versions, for instance) will eventually dissuade you from keeping it available in its pristine state?

      "I get that the author wanted to explore constraint solvers, but why can't you use a greedy algorithm for this problem? Sort the inventory slots by how much bundle space they consume, and insert the cheapest slots. The only way I see this failing is with multiple bundles, but in practice in Minecraft (which is admittedly not really part of the constraint problem) bundles only help when you have many distinct items but a large number of items occur only a few items. In that case it isn't hard to find combinations that fill each bundle completely by only inserting all of a given item (as opposed to inserting only part of an inventory slot) since many items will have only 1 or 2 copies.reply",
      "I opt for the greedy strategy in most game play scenarios for pretty much the reasons you described here. I was considering making a mod to perform this action for me and was looking for a more \"correct\" solution but greedy is way simpler and just as effective for most cases.reply",
      "If you greedily fill bundles by first inserting all weight-4 items (pearls, etc.) in any order into a single bundle, moving to a new bundle each time the current one gets full, then inserting all weight-1 items (sticks, etc.) in any order in the same way, the solution you get will use an optimal number of bundles, and also leave an optimal amount of free capacity in the final bundle. (It helps to notice that every bundle except the last must be completely full with no wasted space, since both 4 and 1 divide 64.)If you do the same, but add all weight-1 items before adding all weight-4 items, you'll still get a solution using the same (optimal) number of bundles, but you may use more capacity in the final bundle than needed -- e.g., if you have 61 sticks and 1 pearl, and add them in that order, the first bundle wastes 3 slots and the second uses 4 slots (vs. no wasted space in the first bundle and just 1 slot used in the second if adding in the reverse order).OTOH, if you mix adding items of different weights (while staying with the approach of only ever adding to the current bundle if there's room, and if not, moving to a fresh bundle) then you can arrive at a suboptimal number of bundles. E.g., adding 61 sticks, 1 pearl and 3 dirt in that order will require 3 bundles instead of the optimal 2.reply",
      "Neat idea, though I didn't fully understand the details since I'm not experienced in constraint solvers. Might have to look into it.Games often lead to interesting computational problems. Another example - I was designing a solver for Flow [0] which made me think about graph problems and applications in e.g. circuit board wire routing. Intuitively it's easy, but translating that into logic is more challenging.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_Freereply",
      "Back in uni, we had to design a MIP program to solve flow, it was a nice and fun problem.Turns out you can save a lot of time and effort by just cutting infeasible solutions out one by one, and resuming the solver, as opposed to writing some tricky constraints.reply",
      ">You have 27 inventory slots, 9 hotbar slots, 4 armor slots, 4 temporary crafting slots, 1 offhand slot, and 1 temporary slot for the result of crafting.There is also a slot for your cursor. When your inventory is open you can click on an item to put it in your cursor slot and it will allow you to pick up an additional item.reply",
      "Thanks for catching this!reply",
      "This is cool.Another POV is, is any game made better by having serious constraint satisfaction problems hiding inside of it?Before I get flamed for the question, another way of stating the question is, would Minecraft be made better if it didn\u2019t limit the inventory size, or if the inventory limits were so simple as to not require any kind of constraint satisfaction, whether traditional (ie reading a wiki what to do) or programmatic?reply"

    "first_paragraph": "Robert WI read a blog post on how Many Hard Leetcode Problems are Easy Constraint Problems and was pleasantly surprised at how approachable MiniZinc was compared to other solver software I have been exposed to, and the examples given helped me to understand how to apply it to a domain I was already familiar with. I have always wanted to be able to get more familiar with using constraint satisfaction as a way to solve problems, so I decided to create a solver to help optimize storage space for Minecraft using constraint satisfaction to help learn how to use this tool. I will outline my thought process and how I reached the solution I came up with.In Minecraft, your player inventory is limited. You have 27 inventory slots, 9 hotbar slots, 4 armor slots, 4 temporary crafting slots, 1 offhand slot, 1 temporary slot for the result of crafting, and you can hold 1 item in your cursor (thanks charcircuit).Each slot can either contain a single item, a small stack of 16, or a full stack of 64 it"

      "I think this post overstates the \"loss\" of free software. Yes, closed firmware and locked hardware are real gaps...but that doesn't erase the fact that open software has completely reshaped the modern stack. From Linux and K8s to Postgres and Python, it is the infra of the internet. \"Winning\" doesn't have to mean owning every transistor; it means setting the norms and powering most of what's built.I tend to see this kind of absolutist, binary tone a lot from people deeply involved in FOSS... and sometimes I think maybe that mindset is necessary to push the movement forward, but it also feels detached from how much open software has already changed reality.reply",
      "> \"Winning\" doesn't have to mean owning every transistorIt absolutely does.Corporations are pushing remote attestation now. They can detect if we \"tampered\" with our devices now. They discriminate against us for it. Installed your own open source software? All services denied. Can't even log into your own bank account.We're marginalized. Second class citizens. There is no choice, it's either corporate owned computers or nothing. What good is free software if we can't run it?reply",
      "Its a lost battle not a lost war. You have to adapt for the circumstances of the time. Today that seems to be using a device that is closed but gapped only to get the essentials done(government services, banking etc.)For everything else continue to use and improve the open offerings.In the meantime, keep fighting and supporting organizations to get laws pushed to ensure open devices can access essential services. (Administrations change, whats dire now may be hope tomorrow).I've come to realize that a lot of closed digital services are just fluff and not needed. So I try to accept that I dont need them. Its a journey.reply",
      "This may sound silly but I think desktop linux \"winning\" is of the utmost importance right now. Free software is pretty much shut off from the appliance/mobile computing platforms but if a sizable portion of personal computers remain using free software it will be hard for the big corporations to fully close the web or make platform attestation truly required for everything.Preserving such mindshare into the future might enable us to show people why they should care about free software and perhaps finally obviate how much malfeasance the perpetrators of closed platforms can do contrasted to the remaining open platforms on pcs (assuming people don't just completely abandon pcs...). This may also help push and convince law makers into legislating in favor of free software and open platforms.reply",
      "Agreed. It's all about leverage. Without huge numbers of users, we have no leverage. Corporations can afford to just drop us because of our software preferences. That would not be the case if there were more of us.",
      "Multiple devices is the answer. Otherwise you end up with people having their banking hacked because they installed a game mod.reply",
      "Here's a take on this which might be unpopular:Open source software lost in this domain fair and absolutely square. Desktop linux has been an extremely accessible and decent option desktops and laptops for, what, three decades; it lost in the open market. I'm typing this comment on arch linux, but even so: It failed to become a force sizable enough to fight back against the tide of corporate-owned attested consumer hardware. Android has been an option for nearly two decades. Its reasonably successful, globally. Google is now toggling the doomsday switch everyone knew they had, to force all applications to go through the Google Mothership. Samsung could fight back; they won't. Motorola could fight back; they won't. The market could revolt; it won't.Software being open source is not enough to change the tide on what the market wants. Should service providers be forced (e.g. by regulation) to support consumer hardware stacks they prefer not to? By what mechanism do you propose we stop a bank from saying \"we'll only support connections from iOS devices\", if not the democratic market force of ensuring enough of their customers demand access from devices running free and open source software? You get there by building products people want. Anything else is succumbing to the same authoritarian forces that you're hoping free software will stop, by forcing service providers to behave against their own interests.If that was unpopular, here's where it gets really unpopular: I don't see a doomsday-level problem with a world where, in addition to whatever awesome FOSS hardware I might have, I also have an iPhone 12 ($130 on swappa) as my \"attested device\" to do \"attested stuff\" with, like store my drivers license, banking, whatever. To me, this is... fine. Not ideal; but fine. We should fight like hell to score wins where we can, like in right to repair, parts availability, ensuring old devices are kept up to date for as long as possible (Apple is pretty good at this); but if I have to carry an old iPhone in my backpack to access my bank because they refuse to support my hypothetical GnuPhone 5, the world isn't going to end.We need nerds who care about this to stop typing on hackernews and go start a phone hardware company. That's it.reply",
      "I've done research on this, and have considered it but it's capital and time intensive even if I think it's viable.There are two reasons I think it's viable now:1. It's possible to wire an agentic system management service into the OS to handle a lot of the routine stuff, so non-technical users will be able to just talk to their computer and it'll be fine tuned to be good at fixing system issues, installing/removing software, managing windows, etc. I developed a scheduling inversion of control executor for enterprise agent control that I've looked into adapting for this use case.2. The steam deck has proven a new model. Game friendly and a simplified UI is enough to carry Linux. New Arch rices like Omarchy are pushing the envelope of usability. I've been ricing desktops since enlightenment on slackware 96, so I'm pretty familiar with this world.Regarding form factor, I'm not a huge fan of phones, too many tradeoffs. I think with strong AI voice systems, the optimal setup is buds + tablet. That's a better setup for mobile linux anyhow, and it makes the hardware almost a non-issue.reply",
      "> Should service providers be forced (e.g. by regulation) to support consumer hardware stacks they prefer not to?Yes.Well, sort of. They don't actually have to do anything. Nobody wants to force them to work for us, that's slavery.Just don't get in our way when we start writing and using our own software. That's the \"support\" we want. Just stay out of our way. Leave us alone, without actively discriminating against us for it.reply",

That's it.Didn't you just spend most of your comment talking about how the market forces don't care anyway? Would good is starting up a phone hardware company that will ultimately go bust due to total apathy of the general consumer?reply"
