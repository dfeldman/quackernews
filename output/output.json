      "As a systems enthusiast I enjoy articles like this. It is really easy to get into the mindset of \"this must be perfect\".In the Blekko search engine back end we built an index that was 'eventually consistent' which allowed updates to the index to be propagated to the user facing index more quickly, at the expense that two users doing the exact same query would get slightly different results. If they kept doing those same queries they would eventually get the exact same results.Systems like this bring in a lot of control systems theory because they have the potential to oscillate if there is positive feedback (and in search engines that positive feedback comes from the ranker which is looking at which link you clicked and giving it a higher weight) and it is important that they not go crazy. Some of the most interesting, and most subtle, algorithm work was done keeping that system \"critically damped\" so that it would converge quickly.Reading this description of how user's timelines are sharded and the same sorts of feedback loops (in this case 'likes' or 'reposts') sounds like a pretty interesting problem space to explore.\n \nreply",
      "An airline reservation system has to be perfect (no slack in today's skies),  a hotel reservation can be 98% perfect so long as there is some slack and you don't mind putting somebody up in a better room than they paid for from time to time.A social media system doesn't need to be perfect at all.  It was clear to me from the beginning that Bluesky's feeds aren't very fast,  not like they are crazy slow,  but if it saves money or effort it's no problem if notifications are delayed 30s.\n \nreply",
      "It's funny because from my experience airline systems are very imperfect (timing wise).I (unwisely) tried to purchase an Icelandair ticket via the Chase travel portal.  I would get a reservation number, go buy seats on Icelandair's website, and a few days later the entire reservation would vanish into the ether.  Rinse and repeat 3x.I can't remember the exact verbiage, but basically tickets can be \"reserved\" and \"booked\".  One means the ticket is allocated, and one means the ticket is actually paid for.  I eventually sat on the phone with an executive support person as they booked the ticket and got it all the way through.  It turns out Chase reserves a ticket on an airline but as an SLA of ~3 days to actually pay for the ticket.  Icelandair's requires a ticket to be paid with in 24 hours, so it was timing out.\n \nreply",

      "I'm a Chinese Malaysian, and I feel the need to highlight the other side of the coin\u2014the risks multinational corporations (MNCs) face when setting up data centers in Malaysia.Despite being elected on the promise of reform, the government's actual performance has been anything but. The press is still frequently suppressed; social media platforms are required to obtain a yearly license or risk being fined or shut down. There was even a time when the MCMC\u2014the country\u2019s communications regulatory body\u2014forced all ISPs to route traffic through their DNS instead of allowing users to freely use Google or Cloudflare DNS, enabling government censorship.On that last point, the MCMC backed down after massive public outcry, but the government's authoritarian tendencies remain palpable.Speaking of authoritarianism, the current Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has proudly likened himself to Southeast Asia\u2019s version of Erdogan. And indeed, he seems to be increasingly authoritarian just like Erdogan, curbing free speech while advancing an Islamist agenda. Under his leadership, the country is becoming increasingly intolerant, particularly as the majority Malay Muslims frequently target minorities\u2014sometimes on a near-weekly basis. You might be surprised to learn that socks printed with the word \"Allah\" resulted in the store owner being charged and penalized in court. Meanwhile, ongoing debates about banning convenience stores from selling liquor in Muslim-majority areas never seem to die down. Non-Muslims remain uncertain about when they might inadvertently face repercussions for perceived \"mistakes\"\u2014whether intentional or not.Additionally, Anwar's staunch support for Hamas may not sit well with the current U.S. administration. Whether this will lead to investors pulling out remains to be seen.\n \nreply",

Especially since Hong Kong's return to China, Singapore has benefited and see an increase in head offices and employment.However, over the last couple of decades surrounding countries have improved significantly.  Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand to name a few.  Layer on top the ever increasing cost of living in Singapore and the latest trend is MNCs moving their offices outside of Singapore.The benefit is a lower cost of operation including office rent and employee wages and it will be interesting to see how the trend continues.

      "Thanks!re the Wireshark analogy: the reason I used that was because: (1) Subtrace operates at roughly the same level in the operating system stack, (2) has similar capabilities, (3) has an overlap in use-cases, and (4) has been the most effective at communicating what Subtrace is in my experience so far. I can see why the analogy is not a perfect 1:1 mapping (obligatory xkcd: https://xkcd.com/624), but naming things is hard and taglines are just names in idea space :)\n \nreply",
      "My first impression with \"Wireshark for Docker containers\" is \"... Well, Wireshark already works with Docker containers, so if your goal is to be Wireshark for Docker containers, you'll just fail by definition. Can't beat Wireshark at being Wireshark.\"I'm saying this just FYI. I haven't actually looked at what your product does, but if it were to matter to me, it'd be based on what it can offer that Wireshark can't, rather than how similar it is to Wireshark.\n \nreply",
      "Can I download a pcap file? Being able to view and debug the application protocol is one thing, but I can use Wireshark to view and debug TCP itself.Reading the documentation makes it sound like this sits one or two levels above where Wireshark usually operates, which is why I think the analogy is tough.\n \nreply",
      "Looks like it is for http requests only? If so, wireshark is not an apt comparison.\n \nreply",
      "For now, yes :)Since we operate at the TCP level, we can actually handle pretty much any protocol. I have an implementation of a postgres handler in my git stash that intercepts and shows the SQL queries executed + the resulting rows alongside the HTTP request that triggered it (I still need to do some robustness and correctness testing before it's ready to merge). With a handful of other protocols like MySQL, Mongo, Redis, Kafka, or even FTP lol, I think Subtrace can cover most practical dev workloads.Btw Subtrace can already record .pcap files today since it's just a simple TCP stream proxy, but raw network packet captures are mostly only useful when you're implementing new protocols, which 99% of the people using Docker containers today aren't doing. It's also a solved problem because you can just run `apt-get install tcpdump` inside the container.Automatic tracing for app-level protocols that is easy to setup, works everywhere, lightweight for prod, fast to search, and can show the data in a clean interface is still insanely difficult today. That's the problem Subtrace is trying to solve.\n \nreply",
      "It's a pretty cool looking product. It's not wireshark, it's not close to wireshark just because it can capture some tcp pcaps, and there are more protocols relevant to container networking than a handful of TCP app-level protocols.When I came in I was hoping to see a product that actually was for container networking, not just app data flows. Again - this is a neat tool, and probably incredibly useful for people developing way up the stack like that, but a lot of us live below the bottom of a \"full-stack developer's\" stack. Some features I would expect in a \"wireshark for Docker containers\":* Ability to inspect DNS traffic* Ability to trace packets the enter the conainter network stack (e.g. the packet(s) generated when the server calls send() ) into the virtual interface for the namespace and through the host machine. Ideally with multiple observation points and correlation of packets in the overlay/underlay contexts (decrypting from local keys whenever possible).* Ability to see where a packet dies between the app and exit NIC on the host. Including things like \"packets delivered to this container even though the dest IP/subnet isn't in this container\"* Similar to the previous point: ability to track packets through all the NAT steps containers introduce.* See arp traffic on virtual interfaces.* Ability to observe the TLS handshake and gather all the parameters of the connection.* Packet dissection and protocol session tracing for all the tunnels.* Bonus points if you can capture weird teleports caused by ebpf programs in the network path.I expect this because that's how I use wireshark_+ bpftrace in container environments for the most part. I've also used it to debug while implementing protocols, but that's a less common use case of packet dissection and tracing in wireshark.What you've built is cool, and I can see it expanding in a lot of directions very, very, usefully. I just really dislike something calling itself a wireshark while not really helping with networking (and in fact - the networking has to work reasonably well for this tool to be effective).\n \nreply",
      "That's totally fair, I can see why Wireshark wouldn't be the most accurate description to someone working on those kinds of problems. And fwiw, I wish my problems (before Subtrace) were cool enough to need to whip out Wireshark for packet-level inspection :)\n \nreply",

      "The pathology for broken collar bones was changing right as I took up mountain biking, and subsequently shattered my collarbone.It was hotly debated at the hospital, if my specific case should be operated on or not. Each time I had a checkup, one doctor would say \"wait and see\" while the other was saying \"I can't believe we didn't operate on this\".At any rate, the outcome was as good as if they had operated on it, according to the doc anyway. Nice of them to test it out on me!More related to this though, I have broken both my collarbones, the first time I had little direction and just held my arm still for 2-3 months. It took forever to heal, and my arm atrophied significantly. The second time, similar severity. I was guided through rehab and I was back using my arm within the first month, very little atrophy.\n \nreply",
      "I had a broken collar bone last year in Bucharest and I moved back to my hometown because of it. I had to check in after a week or two to see how it's healing but was lazy about it so I went to the hospital after 3 weeks and was told there's a waiting list 10 days long and go to a private clinic. At the private clinic the doctor didn't even look at me, or the x-rays I just took and just told me to go into surgery back in Bucharest. Luckily when my mother heard she found a surgeon through a friend of a friend that looked at my x-rays on whatsapp and told me it's fine but just to be sure to visit him in Bucharest feel it in person, which the private care doctor never did.So after 4 weeks I went to this last guy in a public hospital, told me I'm fine and can take off my brace, wait a week or two and go into physical therapy. Also told me in 20 years he only had to once or twice do a collar bone surgery so it's almost never the answer.It's amazing that just being told I'm fine I could relax and all my muscle aches literally were gone 1 hour after that meeting so my advice in general is, be very careful what doctor you choose because medical hexing really is a thing. We put doctors on this pedestal and if God forbid you catch them in a bad mood they can fuck you up worse than before you saw them.\n \nreply",
      "I've still never heard a satisfactory explanation for how in the hell two parts of a bone, broken such that they aren't even touching, can find their way back to each other and heal. My son broke his collar bone, and the hospital sent him home in a sling. When I looked at the x-ray, I couldn't believe that's the correct treatment. But a month or two later and he was good as new. Absolutely blows my mind every time I think of it.\n \nreply",
      "I shattered my collarbone - and I do mean shattered, ~8 pieces - in a mountain bike crash September 2023. I went over the bars after the back wheel of my hardtail caught a berm. Landed on my head and shoulder and compressed it laterally inwards by about 2 inches.Even with this mess, it was hotly debated for around two weeks whether I needed surgery. A good chunk of my collarbone was trying to push through my skin and the other half was fusing to my scapular and was starting to compromise nerve function. Even then, because the non-surgical route is now considered the standard, I was meeting resistance to have an ORIF. It seems that the about turn from surgical intervention has been so strong that getting ANY surgical intervention is a battle.I eventually came across a surgeon who took one look at me (never mind the imaging) and scheduled me for surgery. ~18 months later I\u2019m now on a waiting list to have the plate removed, and strangely have gone off cycling\u2026 Surfing has happily taken its place.\n \nreply",

      "Shattered mine mountain biking as well (6 pieces). Ortho took one look at it and scheduled surgery for the next day. It wasn't a 'standard' break since it included my AC joint and coracoclavicular ligaments which needed a special type of plate. Ultimately it took 2 surgeries (ORIF, then plate removal). Total recovery was 9 months. My arm/shoulder is as strong as it was before, and it looks anatomically correct.My shoulder immediately felt \"better\" after ORIF. I would suggest it if it's way out of whack... mine was drooping probably 2\". I can't imagine how much it would suck if the bones healed that way.\n \nreply",
      "Mine felt immediately worse after the ORIF. After two weeks getting comfortable in their new positions, all the ligaments really resented getting wrenched back into place.Good illustration was that my run of the mill, 45 minute surgery ended up taking 4.5 hours.It\u2019s good to hear that everything felt good after your plate was removed. At 18 months post-surgery, I\u2019m in a really good place where I can do most anything I want. Only occasionally experience discomfort if my son headbutts the plate or a backpack strap rubs on it. I was in two minds about having it removed as it would be a step backwards to post-surgical, but the likelihood of me doing something stupid again in the future means it\u2019s worth it. Rather have the fuse that a clavicle is rather than fracture my sternum!\n \nreply",
      "I should restate - mine definitely did not feel better post-surgery, the ORIF pain was worse than the break, but it felt good to have my bones secure with my shoulder in its anatomically correct place, and not have any more crepitus.My plate was extremely uncomfortable, it was a \"hook plate\" which held my collar bone to my scapula. I couldn't raise my arm above shoulder height with it installed, it had to be removed after 6mo.Plate removal was a bit tougher than anticipated (short term). I read accounts of it being a 'relief' but I was in quite bit of pain.\n \nreply",

Last year he broke the other ankle. But this time, after surgery, his doctor surprised us by instructing Mark to walk on it two weeks later.It turns out the standard advice to stay off a broken leg bone for at least six weeks is based less on scientific evidence and more on cultural caution\u2014physicians like to play it safe. But now studies show that complications are no more likely with early weight-bearing than with a long delay.

      "I'll never forget the TI-99/4A. I was 8 years old, in second grade in Southern California. We had a \"computer lab\" which was a mobile building with 13 or 15 TI-99/4A's, and about half of them had color TV's and the rest, B+W. Nobody really knew anything, but we did have books to copy BASIC programs out of.One kid entered a program that flashed colors and patterns on the color TV. Our teacher was epileptic, and this sent her into a seizure. Myself and another kid ran to get the 5th grade teacher who'd been a doctor at some point (don't ask, I dont know, I was 8) and he came running and attended to her. She was fine.I'd always been interested in how things work, taking things apart, playing with my 30-in-1 electronics lab from Radio Shack. But this new computer thing... this was something. That experience flipped a bit in my 8 year old brain. All because of a TI-99/4A.\n \nreply",
      "I guess next week they're going to get to the interesting bit which is how weird the architecture actually was on that thing...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4AParticularly it only had 256 bytes of RAM attached to the CPU but had (I think) 16 kb of RAM attached to the video controller which the CPU could read and write through I/O registers.  You could use this for non-video storage but you couldn't access it directly.Coding in BASIC could,  at the very least,  hide the insanity from you.\n \nreply",
      "It gets way weirder.The TMS9900 didn't have any internal data registers. It only had a program counter, a status register, and a workspace pointer. Instead, it put the \"registers\" in that same 256 bytes of RAM. There were sixteen 16-bit registers which the workspace pointer pointed to.The original idea was that this made for fast context switches, instead of dumping all registers to stack (it doesn't even have a stack pointer), just update the workspace pointer to point at a new set. But I have to assume this wasn't really used on the TI-99/4A, as there just wasn't enough RAM. Because your only other ram was locked behind the video controller, that 256 bytes had to contain all your registers, any your dynamically loaded code and any data you wanted rapid access to.The TMS9900 is weird, because it's the only CPU of the early home computer era that wasn't designed for microcomputers. It's actually an implementation of the TI-990 mini-computer on a single chip and is actually used in later versions of the minicomputer. Those minicomputers had more than enough fast 16-bit memory to take advantage of this fast context switching.Every other commonly used microprocessor of the 70s (8080, 6800, F8, 6502, RCA1802, Z80, 6809, 8086, 68000) was explicitly designed to target the low-cost microcomputer market.\n \nreply",
      "Speaking of interesting bits, this machine isn't actually an 8-bit computer, the CPU is 16-bit. (The video controller is 8-bit though, i.e. the VRAM data bus is 8-bits. It's also the same video controller used in various other machines, e.g. MSX.)\n \nreply",
      "As I recall at the time, very few people knew how to write assembly for that machine, as there just wasn't a lot to go on.I enjoyed the sprites though, and that was something that was definitely different than Apple II, IBM, etc. at the time.  Apple and IBM's graphics were definitely a step down.C64 could do sprites with POKE statements apparently.  But that was definitely not as nice as the TI.\n \nreply",
      "I still have my TI-99/4A!  I received it Christmas morning of 1983, although a Timex/Sinclair had been on my wish list.  Sears had them marked down to $50 during the 8-bit wars.  Mom had been up all night hand-typing in a BASIC demo so it would be running in the morning.  Many Wumpuses were hunted that day.Today, it has a F17A video processor that enables VGA output: https://dnotq.io/f18a/intro.htmlAnd a FinalGROM99 cartridge, so I can have an SD card with all the program cartridges loaded.  https://endlos99.github.io/finalgrom99/There's still a community of fairly active development for retrogames, and some of them are quite good given capabilities of the hardware.  My niece particularly enjoys a marble game called Skyway, try it on the online emulator at https://ti99ers.com\n \nreply",
      "This was my very first computer, at age 13. I learned hexadecimal by drawing pictures of spaceships on graph paper, coloring in the squares that had lines through them, splitting the grid into 8x8 sections with a ruler, converting each row of 8 pixels into a hexadecimal number, and then typing them all into DATA statements, just to see the picture take shape on my screen when I ran the program. For some reason, I thought that was just the coolest. About a year later I upgraded to the Commodore 64, but I'll always have a spot in my heart for my TI.\n \nreply",
      "This was my first computer as well! (age 8?)   And I too spent time in class drawing spaceships on graph paper, rather than listening to the teacher.    I was certainly obsessed with BASIC programming.  I didn't start assembly language until the Apple IIe a few years later.I'm surprised now to see it was a 16-bit CPU -- I had no idea.  I assumed 8-bit as most home computers were (6502, Z80, etc).Two things I remember:Saving and loading programs on cassette tapes (where are they? I'm jealous of another poster who still has their TI99/4a).It was insanely easy to reboot it accidentally -- I had to look it up again but apparently it was by pressing Shift-Q [1].

      "The most obvious issues with this is that the game boils down to predicting passenger patterns, but you're still just comparing two RNGs, which is one of the worst kinds of games. I also don't think this can be called Poker, really. Poker is an imperfect information game, where your hand tells you some information about your opponents' hands.It would be interesting to read HN's ideas on how you can simulate the shared information part of the game in such a scenario.\n \nreply",
      "In the style of Texas Hold'em, both players could secretly choose two seats each and write them down. Then, you'd collectively choose 5 seats to be the shared \"cards.\"This next suggestion would stretch the \"poker\" definition somewhat, but I think it retains the same characteristics (imperfect information, shared \"cards\").You start from a shared list of attributes (coat color, presence of a hat, etc.) and designate a row of seats. Each person gets one attribute secretly. You wager after each stop following poker conventions.Only downside to this is that unlike poker, your hand can get worse after a stop.\n \nreply",
      "This misses the information your secret hand gives you about the other player's chances. In poker if I got an Ace in my hand the chance of the opponent having an ace lowers.If I got somebody wearing a black coat, this has no impact on the chance of my opponent having a black coated passenger.\n \nreply",
      "> . I also don't think this can be called Poker, really. Poker is an imperfect information game,There is no game of Poker. It is a wide variety of games like 5-card draw, Omaha, Texas,  studs, Chinese open face poker.

The game is won by comparing cards you have left (meaning that Rummy, Go Fish, or Bridge are different), and there\u2019s a wager about the game (possibly just bragging rights if not playing for money).\n \nreply",
      "I totally agree, but I stand by the opinion that imperfect-information bit is so essential that it's simply assumed (it's, naturally, not specific to just poker card games, though). If you come to the table with your own stack of cards to draw from, it's very likely going to end badly for you, depending on how transparent you're with the matter.\n \nreply",
      "Not that I disagree with anything about the nature of those games, but your narrow usage of a word poker is wrong.I even checked the Wikipedia article about Poker and there is a quote very similar to my wording:\"Other games that use poker hand rankings may likewise be referred to as poker.\"\n \nreply",
      "Well, it's my opinion based on the assumption that players used to specific common card games under the moniker might be disappointed when a new game with the same name lacks an essential component (and it's not cards).Naming things is hard but there's no hard limits for the expansive approach, you can call all card games or all 5-things-games Poker. Your mileage as to communication with other people may vary, though.Where we're disagreeing is at how we're seeing what's conventional.\n \nreply",

      "In general, people are going to interpret this EO with their own lens. Unsurprisingly, reasonable people may disagree on the merits of the EO as a whole.However this part of the EO is pretty concerning> 'The President and the Attorney General, subject to the President\u2019s supervision and control, shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch'and later> 'No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes the President or the Attorney General\u2019s opinion on a matter of law'This can potentially enable an end run around congress and the courts in that the President can easily choose to interpret laws in a manner inconsistent with the intent of congress and courts. Now, we can argue the point and say that presidents have already done so in the past and that congress/courts should have been more specific. However it quickly gets into the issue of the impossibility of congress or the courts anticipating and specifying every detail to avoid a 'hostile' interpretation.This part of the EO says the president's opinion is the law as far as the executive branch is concerned. Given that the executive branch implements the law, this would imply that the president's interpretation is all that matters. The other two branches have no real role left to play. Given the supreme court's ruling on presidential immunity, this is a dangerous level of power concentration.Even if you support the current president's goals and objectives, setting up the president as the sole power center is an inherently unstable system. Nothing prevents the next president from having a radically different opinion. There is a very good reason why the founding fathers built in an elaborate system of checks and balances.\n \nreply",
      "Even with a highly sympathetic Supreme Court it is hard to imagine this EO standing.It goes against the foundation of not only US law, but couple of hundred years of international democratic tradition in which allegiance is not to a person, but to the nation itself.US civil servants and military alike swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution not the president or their commander. Illegal orders are not only expected, but required to be disobeyed.This EO eliminates the concept of an illegal order since the law would be whatever the executive interprets it to be.\n \nreply",
      "If the Supreme Court and Congress has no enforcement power, though, what recourse is there?\n \nreply",
      "I know this sounds corny, but people are the recourse. We are part of the checks and balances.Whether it is as overt as a soldier refusing to follow an illegal order knowing they are risking court marshal, or as clandestine as mid-level bureaucrat slow-walking damaging policies, or people actually voting in local-to-national elections.Democracy is not a passive form of government.\n \nreply",
      "> I know this sounds corny, but people are the recourse. We are part of the checks and balances.By \"we\" here, it seems you mean bureaucrats. But what if your opinions, as an individual, unelected bureaucrat are bad? I don't care what a mid-level bureaucrat's opinions on what policies are damaging is. He could be a neo-nazi for all I know. Constitutionally, we should go with the opinions of the people who won an election, instead of some random dude. I was taught that was what \"democracy\" was, not some random person taking advantage of their position to advance their personal goals.When the guy paid to guard the door starts making his own decisions about who should get to come in, it's not good. It's corruption.\n \nreply",
      "> But what if your opinions, as an individual, unelected bureaucrat are bad?That\u2019s a slightly silly stance to take. Modern developed countries live and die by the quality of their bureaucracy. Making every bureaucratic role an elected position would be insane.How on earth would you organise elections for every single DMV employee? Or every single park ranger? Or every single government accountant or secretary? Every single civil servant involved in collecting the data used to drive policy decisions.To get rid of \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d you would basically have to turn every federal role into an elected role. The federal government employees around 3 million people, even if we say that only 10% of them are \u201creal unelected bureaucrats\u201d, that\u2019s still 300,000 elections you would need to hold every X number of years. How on earth would anyone ever manage any of that?Thats before we get to the insanity which is Musk, the epitome of the \u201cunelected bureaucrat\u201d who seems to be the one leading the charge on many of these \u201cpolicy decisions\u201d, and publicly lambasting \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d as being corrupt and \u201cundemocratic\u201d.\n \nreply",
      "How about this:Individuals with appointment power attach appointees to their ticket like vice presidents. You get the option to write in anyone, but the tickets are defaults.\n \nreply",
      "How does that solve the \u201cunelected bureaucrat\u201d problem? You still need bureaucrats to run a civil service, the appointed positions in U.S. institutions are mostly just figureheads, they\u2019re not handling the day-to-day work of keeping a bureaucracy functioning.Unless you\u2019re suggesting that every bureaucrat role should be an appointment, and part of X years elections, is having people with appointment powers turning up with a list of 300,000-3,000,000 people to fill every bureaucratic role, and somehow the general public are going to scrutinise that in some meaningful manner.All of that is of course ignoring the problem that comes with throwing away all of your bureaucracies institutional knowledge every X number of years. Do you really want the issuance of driving licences, fishing licenses, gun licenses, international visas, customs enforcement, immigration enforcement, to all grind to a holt every 3-5 years while the new folks figure out how stuff works? You would basically end up with a bureaucracy that fundamentally couldn\u2019t achieve anything, and silly things like the rule-of-law would simply cease to exist in the U.S.Why would anyone want to trade with, invest in, or ally with, a country that effectively lobotomises its government every few years, and has zero continuity of governance at even the most basic day-to-day items of modern life?",
      "I read that as an all-inclusive \"we\" and not so narrow as \"bureaucrats\". The examples given are not exhaustive, if you have an imsgination.\nThere are many ways to fight for what you believe in. Look up mutual aid, participatory democracy, and the histories of women's suffrage and the fight in the USA for equal rights for Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (that fight is nowhere near over).\nStart with loving yourself, extent that to others, and if you feel like you're teetering, lean on others and find your balance again.If I'm the guy guarding the door (and I have been), I damn well make my own decisions to the best of my ability, to where I would be willing to explain the what and why of my actions.\n \nreply",
      "You\u2019re right. But if the guy paid to guard the door is told to start letting gangsters in by management, whistleblowing and civil disobedience become championed by the public rather than condemned, that\u2019s \u201cthe people\u2019s\u201d check and balance to power.

Beyond extracting motion signals from source video, we additionally capture environmental representations as conditional inputs. The environment is formulated as the region with the exclusion of characters and our model generates characters to populate these regions while maintaining coherence with the environmental context. We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy that more effectively characterizes the relationship between character and environment.
