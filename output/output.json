      "That's an incredible find and once I saw the assembly I was right along with them on the debug path. Interestingly it doesn't need to be assembly for this to work, it's just that that's where the split was. The IR could've done it, it just doesn't for very good reasons. So another win for being able to read arm assembly.Unsure if this would be another way to do it but to save an instruction at the cost of a memory access you could push then pop the stack size maybe? Since presumably you're doing that pair of moves on function entry and exit. I'm not really sure what the garbage collector is looking for so maybe that doesn't work, but I'd be interested to hear some takes on itreply",
      "You would normally use the \u201cLDR Rd, =expr\u201d pseudo-instruction form [1]. For immediates not directly constructible, it puts a copy of the immediate value in a PC-relative memory location, then does a PC-relative load into register.So that would turn the whole sequence of \u201cadd constant to SP\u201d into 2 executable instructions, 1 for constructing immediate and 1 for adding for a total of 8 bytes, and a 4 byte data area for the 17-bit immediate for a total of 12 bytes of binary which is 3 executable instructions worth.[1] https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/l/A64-Data-T...reply",
      "I've usually seen compilers handle large constants with MOV/MOVK sequences (encoding 16 bits of data per 32-bit instruction) instead of loading them from memory.  Loading from memory was more common on 32-bit ARM.reply",
      "I'm a little surprised that this bug wasn't fixed in the assembler as a special case for immediate adds to RSP.  If the patch was to the compiler only, other instances of the bug could be lurking out there in aarch64 assembly code.reply",
      "Would that be wise? The implemented solution uses a temporary register to hold the full value being added to rsp.I don't know enough about how people use the go assembler, but I imagine it would be very surprising if `add $imm, rsp, rsp` clobbered an unrelated register when `$imm` is large enough. Especially since what's clobbered is the designated \"temporary register\", which I imagine is used all the time in handwritten go assembly.reply",
      "Some architectures, and I believe aarch64 is one, have scratch registers reserved for being clobbered in special situations required by the assembler.reply",
      "Not really, or at least not that I know if in the case of arm64. What you have is calling conventions that specify what one function/procedure/whatever can expect both from the caller and the callee's side.n\n I.e. some registers are caller-saved, some are callee-saved, which basically means the called function can treat them as \"scratch\".Additionally, they call out interactions with the OS/execution environment. For example, x18 is the \"platform register\", and it's unspecified what the OS does with it. It's entirely possible that it clobbers it on context switch or during an interrupt or whatever. So don't use that one unless you have a contract with the OS itself.But locally, i.e. \"from instruction to instruction\", no such convention exists to my knowledge, and you probably don't want to have registers that pseudo-instructions might trash inadvertently in general, because it means you can't optimally use these registers.It's possible for pseudo-instructions or generally macros to be documented as, e.g., \"this macro uses x3 as a temporary register and trashes it\", but in my experience most macros that need additional temporary registers actually ask you to specify them as part of the macro invocation.E.g. suppose you have a macro \"weirdhash\" that takes two registers and saves some kind of hash of them in a third register, but that also needs an extra register to perform its work. You would call it with:    weirdhash x9, x10, x11, x0\n\nWhere x0 would be the scratch register you don't care about.reply",
      "> So another win for being able to read arm assembly.Yes, though that weird stuff with dollars in it is not normal AArch64 assembly!The article could have mentioned the \"stack moves once\" rule.reply",
      "It is due to the Plan 9 Assembly dialect most likely, because it wasn't enough that we already have differences between AT&T and Intel.https://go.dev/doc/asmStill, I find great that Go got back the 1990's tradition that compiled languages have an assembler as part of their tooling, regardless of the syntax.reply",
      "I've never heard of that rule (though tbh I'm not allocating > 64KB of stack when I'm in assembly) and it seems Google hasn't either. While I'm sure it makes sense, I don't think I've ever seen that be enforced. At least in C/C++. Maybe it makes more sense for these stack inspecting garbage collectors but I've also heard of ones that just scan the stack without unwinding anything. I did a test asking Google's AI to generate a complicated C function, put it in godbolt, and there's plenty of push push push push ..... Pop Pop Pop Pop going onreply"

      "The Miami stock exchange (MIAX) has their matching engines colocated in Equinix's NY4 data center in Secaucus NJ, much like many other exchanges.  I would not be surprised if TXSE does the same.Many trading firms already have their trading engines in that data center and I would assume TXSE would want quick access to that order flow and this might be easier if they are in NY4.Of course, they may want to have their colo facilities in TX in their own data center, that way they can rent out space and make some extra revenue, but then they'd have to build that out.reply",
      "> I would assume TXSE would want quick access to that order flowPerhaps Texas could use a different trading model that doesn't require ultra high speed trading.Matt Levine often mulls the idea of a system with a trading window that doesn't let the fastest connection to the order book win. Perhaps an order book that works at human speeds so humans can trade too (I can think of a few ways to do it - but would need modelling to try and figure what actually works). He points out that most trades are done in the last hour, so really trading only needs to occur once a day.The issue is whether a market trading system can be designed with suitable restrictions that beats the current market design (for listed companies and for traders).Designing markets is hard because you have to assume every player is selfish and only cooperates where it is to their benefit and will defect or cheat if the incentives of the market encourage that (Enron in the California energy markets).Unlikely since SEC would need to approve of a different system of  market trade incentives.Edit: Personally I would like to see an exchange that was more international. I'm from New Zealand and our good businesses often list on the  Australian exchange rather than the NZSX. The system of ADRs for other countries feels like a massive hack.reply",
      "Reg NMS\u2019s Order Protection Rule (Rule 611) says you can\u2019t trade through protected NBBO quotes, outside a few narrow exceptions. That\u2019s the letter of the law.The practical effect isn\u2019t just a bit of latency. It rewires incentives. With 611 in place, the question for latency-sensitive firms becomes: what HFT tactics can I run that are 611-compatible? Without 611, the question would be: what HFT tactics actually add value for my counterparties? That\u2019s a very different optimization.For firms on direct feeds (often building their own synthetic NBBO), 611 doesn\u2019t add much information. The constraint is compliance, not discovery.Because NBBO is size-agnostic and top-of-book, anchoring execution to it lets micro-lot quotes steer outcomes. You can influence the protected price with tiny displayed size. That\u2019s great for gamesmanship, bad for displayed depth, size-sensitive pricing, and near-touch discovery.Also: if two informed counterparties want to trade away from the protected price to reflect size or information, 611 mostly blocks that outside limited carve-outs. We lose mutually beneficial, size-aware prints to satisfy a benchmark that ignores size.On settlement, the uniform benchmark helps in calm markets. But it\u2019s na\u00efve to think that holds through a real black swan. In stress, timestamp ambiguities and fragmented data make \u201cwhat was executable\u201d contestable, and disputes spike regardless of quote protection.In a sound market structure, the clearer (CCP or clearing broker) should carry and underwrite that tail risk\u2014margin, default funds, capital, and enforceable rulebooks. Instead, 611 shifts accountability onto quote-protection mechanics, insulating clearers from responsibility and, perversely, amplifying systemic risk when the system most needs well-capitalized risk absorbers.reply",
      "There is no reason why shares should be bought on sold in time frames far too short for anything to have meaningfully changed about the companies or market conditions.reply",
      "This is the free market speaking. If there was one exchange there would be ~no~ less latency arbitrage. But there are many... Which creates a competitive landscape and reduces fees for investors. The by product is you have many HFTs that come in to take advantage of mispricings, even if they are on sub millisecond scales. It doesn't harm the company or the investor. Its quite the opposite... Investors benefit from competition amongst exchanges and HFTs.In addition you have redundancy in the markets system. Exchanges are important for national security... Having everything centralized would risk people's retirements, savings, and morereply",
      "The issue isn't that there's a lot of change coming from inside the markets, it's that there's a lot of change coming from outside the market, and it's all interconnected.reply",
      "In a millionth of a second? This a rationalization for something that is only being done because it can be done.reply",
      "I think you are letting your \"speculation is bad\" bias interfere with your understanding of dynamical systems.reply",
      "I think you're hallucinating something I didn't say to avoid confronting what I did say.Also what's the difference between a system, a dynamic system and a 'dynamical' system?reply",
      "The behavior of other participants is itself a first-class signal.Rule 611 compresses that signal. By forcing everything to orbit a size-agnostic NBBO, it collapses a lot of the \u201cbehavioral bandwidth\u201d (depth, imbalance, sweep patterns, replenishment, cancel/replace cadence) into a single top-of-book tick. Less resolution, less information.High-resolution flow tells you who wants what, at what size, and how urgently. When we gate execution through protected quotes, we encourage tactics that flick the top-of-book with tiny size and discourage truthful size revelation. That\u2019s signal destruction dressed up as protection.Letting informed counterparties print away from the protected price (to reflect size or information) increases informational content. You get cleaner read-through from actual willingness to trade, instead of a compliance-driven dance around a fragile benchmark.So yes: other people\u2019s actions are the best data feed. The more of that behavior we can see\u2014in size, time, and venue\u2014the better our discovery gets. 611 reduces that visibility by design.reply"

      "I still miss Google Reader. I loved the social aspects, where I could repost my favorite articles (with comments about them), and friends could easily subscribe to my feed and comment on my shares. It was a really great social network for sharing blog posts and articles. I credit the demise of Google Reader with a lot of the downfall of the Old Web.Since then, social sharing platforms are motivated to keep you on their platform. I recently ran an experiment on Facebook, where I posted a link to a content creator's video on YouTube with a lot of my thoughts about it.I then downloaded the same video from YouTube and uploaded it to Facebook (this particular creator didn't upload his content to Facebook directly), and posted the exact same text content (but this time, hid the link the the source video in a comment).The post where I downloaded + reposted the video got about 1000x more views than the one where I linked to the source.On top of that, Facebook will often hide the link to the source video unless I click \"Show all comments\" (rather than the default \"Show most relevant\").Facebook deprioritizes (shadowbans?) posts that link off of their platform, and it starts feeling like a stagnant pond. It's frustrating that it's difficult to share insightful blog posts on that platform, and I'm feeling pretty done with it.Getting a good RSS reader isn't the part that I'm looking for -- I want the easy social aspect that Google Reader and Google+ gave me.reply",

      "Congratulations to the laureates! Well deserved.The article gives a good simplified explanation, here is my shorter explanation: porous materials, like sponges, have a lot of surface area, which is useful for two main reasons: 1) speeding up reaction rates and 2) capturing and releasing molecules (water, CO2, pollutants, etc.) More surface area is more valuable. Before, the most surface area we had was with zeolites, which are aluminosilicate minerals which occur naturally and are also synthetically produced - the synthetics mostly produced by trial and error. MOFs are unique in a few ways; for one, they are rationally designed molecules where we can predict some properties, and two, the surface area is far higher than zeolites. Zeolites range from 10-1700 m2/gram based on how you measure (most are from 20-400) and MOFs range from 1000-7000+.Unfortunately MOFs are still quite expensive and very much on the cutting edge, so I am forced to use zeolites anytime I want a lot of surface area, but they are getting more accessible (you can now buy them on Amazon!) and I imagine the price will come down for some of the simpler to make MOFs in the near future.reply",

The model molecules automatically had the correct form and structure, because of where the holes were situated.

The deal makes sense as long as the value projected to be added (i.e. via efficiency gains, loss of jobs, changing society, etc) exceeds the capital dilution for the supplier; they use their equity but the leftover equity value increase makes up for it.Given all the passive investing, and funds invested in the top tech companies this is a VERY large pool of capital.

      "I'm just happy that finally, with the popularity of zen4 and 5 chips, AVX512 is around ~20% of the running hardware in the steam hardware survey. It's going to be a long while before it gets to a majority - Intel still isn't shipping its own instruction set in consumer CPUs - but its going the right direction.Compared to the weird, lumpy lego set of avx1/2, avx512 is quite enjoyable to write with, and still has some fun instructions that deliver more than just twice the width.Personal example: The double width byte shuffles (_mm512_permutex2var_epi8) that takes 128 bytes as input in two registers. I had a critical inner loop that uses a 256 byte lookup table; running an upper/lower double-shuffle and blending them essentially pops out 64 answers a cycle from the lookup table on zen5 (which has two shuffle units), which is pretty incredible, and on its own produced a global 4x speedup for the kernel as a whole.reply",
      "Could you please elaborate on your example? Thanks.reply",
      "Sure.. in detail and abstracted slightly, the byte table problem:Maybe you're remapping RGB values [0..255] with a tone curve in graphics, or doing a mapping lookup of IDs to indexes in a set, or a permutation table, or .. well, there's a lot of use cases, right? This is essentially an arbitrary function lookup where the domain and range is on bytes.It looks like this in scalar code:transform_lut(byte* dest, const byte* src, int size, const byte* lut) {\n  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n    dest[i] = lut[src[i]];\n  }\n}The function above is basically load/store limited - it's doing negligible arithmetic, just loading a byte from the source, using that to index a load into the table, and then storing the result to the destination. So two loads and a store per element. Zen5 has 4 load pipes and 2 store pipes, so our CPU can do two elements per cycle in scalar code. (Zen4 has only 1 store pipe, so 1 per cycle there)Here's a snippet of the AVX512 version.You load the lookup table into 4 registers outside the loop:  __m512i p0, p1, p2, p3;\n  p0 = _mm512_load_epi8(lut);\n  p1 = _mm512_load_epi8(lut + 64);\n  p2 = _mm512_load_epi8(lut + 128);\n  p3 = _mm512_load_epi8(lut + 192);\n\nThen, for each SIMD vector of 64 elements, use each lane's value as an index into the lookup table, just like the scalar version. Since we only can use 128 bytes, we DO have to do it twice, once for the lower and again for the upper half, and use a mask to choose between them appropriately on a per-element basis.  auto tLow  = _mm512_permutex2var_epi8(p0, x, p1);\n  auto tHigh = _mm512_permutex2var_epi8(p2, x, p3);\n\nYou can use _mm512_movepi8_mask to load the mask register. That instruction sets each lane is active if its high bit of the byte is set, which perfectly sets up our table. You could use the mask register directly on the second shuffle instruction or a later blend instruction, it doesn't really matter.For every 64 bytes, the avx512 version has one load&store and does two permutes, which Zen5 can do at 2 a cycle. So 64 elements per cycle.So our theoretical speedup here is ~32x over the scalar code! You could pull tricks like this with SSE and pshufb, but the size of the lookup table is too small to really be useful. Being able to do an arbitrary super-fast byte-byte transform is incredibly useful.reply",
      "Here's a non-parallel and unoptimized implementation of that operation in Go:  func _mm512_permutex2var_epi8(a, idx, b [64]uint8) [64]uint8 {\n    var dst [64]uint8\n    for j := 0; j < 64; j++ {\n      i := idx[j]\n      src := a\n      if i&0b0100_0000 != 0 {\n        src = b\n      }\n      dst[j] = src[i&0b0011_1111]\n    }\n    return dst\n  }\n\nBasically, for a lookup table of 8-bit values, you need only 1 instruction to perform up to 64 lookups simultaneously, for each 128 bytes of table.reply",
      "When I optimize stuff, I just think of the SIMD instructions as a long sandwich toaster. You can have a normal toaster that makes one sandwich, or you can have a 4x toaster that makes 4 sandwiches as once. If you have a bunch of sandwiches to make, obviously you want to align your work so that you can do 4 at a time.If you want to make 4 at a time though, you have to keep the thing fed. You need your ingredients in the cache, or you are just going to waste time finding them.reply",
      "Compared to GPU programming the gains from SIMD are limited but it's a small-multiple boost and available pretty much everywhere. C# makes it easy to use through Vector classes. WASM SIMD still has a way to go but even with the current 128-bit you can see dramatic improvements in some buffer-processing cases (I did a little comparison demo here showing a 20x improvement in bitwise complement of a large buffer: https://www.jasonthorsness.com/2)reply",
      "I merged a few PRs to SIMD optimize Wasm WASI libc, but it all got stalled in str(c)spn (which is slightly more sophisticated than the rest).There wasn't much appetite for any of it on Emscripten.https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+opt...reply",
      "subscribed to the str(c)spn thread for the eventual explanation of why the non-simd version seemed to give the wrong answerreply",
      "The WASM folks should just include an arbitrary-length vector compute extension.  We should also explore automatically compiling WASM to GPU compute as appropriate, the hardware independence makes it a rather natural fit for that.reply",
      "4 lanes of SIMD (like in say SSE) is not necessarily 4x faster because of the memory access, sometimes it's better than that (and often it's less).PSHUFB wins in case of unpredictable access patterns. Though I don't remember how much it typically wins.PMOVMSKB can replace several conditionals (up to 16 in SSE2 for byte operands) with only one, winning in terms of branch prediction.PMADDWD is in SSE2, and does 8 byte multiplies not 4.\nSSE4.1 FP rounding that doesn't require changing the rounding mode, etc.\nThe weird string functions in SSE4.2. Non-temporal moves and prefetching in some cases.The cool thing with SIMD is that it's a lot less stress for the CPU access prediction and branch prediction, not only ALU. So when you optimize it will help unrelated parts of your code to go faster.reply"

      "Byuu was fantastic - I remember when they came onto the scene and made a big push for better emulator compatibility across the board. Byuu made positive changes in the world, and I still think about them from time to time.reply",
      "A lot of very talented individuals in the community but I always keep in mind the old saying: \"the candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long\".reply",
      "Byuu was the victim of sustained and targetted online abuse so I'm not sure that saying really applies here.reply",
      "Dolphin has some absolutely fascinating right ups on the lengths they had to go to in order to get Factor 5 games to run. When you're working with a fixed hardware set there are absolutely incredible things you can do to eke out extra performance that will go completely unappreciated until years later when somebody tries to run that software on a emulate hardware.reply",
      "Does anyone know a PC emulator that properly allows mic input via Soundblaster emulation?I managed to find my first published app on archive.org from like 1994, but it's a music visualizer and requires audio input.reply",

      "https://shonumi.github.io/articles/art16.htmlWow, that brings back childhood memories.> I should mention that I was a huge Battle Network fan growing up with the GBA. I joined my first online community (GameWinners.com) specifically for the Mega Man forum.> My first username (Team Shadow V2) was actually a riff on one of the new features found in MMBN2.>  In a way, Battle Network is a huge reason why I'm here trying to preserve old games.> The Battle Network games will always hold memories of joy and nostalgia for me, so I wanted to see the Battle Chip Gates fully emulated not only for the benefit of video game history, but also for my own enjoyment.Me too... MMBN2 is a big reason why I learned English and became a programmer. Huge respect.I still love it so much. It's fun to think back on it and reflect on how oddly prescient it was.PCs reachable directly from the internet, hosting home pages: a world without NAT. Internet connected doghouses and dishwashers. Mobile handheld AI capable personal computers. Everyone has their own custom AI agents that help navigate the complexity of the cyberworld, and also for self-defense. What I can only assume to be vulnerabilities, reified as literal weapons used by the AIs. Underworld networks normal people don't dare to navigate into. Cyber terrorists everywhere doing things like trying to burn people's houses down by electronically sabotating ovens, causing major damage and loss of life by hacking water mains, power grids, traffic signals, trying to nuke dams, actually hacking entire nations and genociding their AI populations, disrupting global environmental control systems, hacking autopilot systems in planes to bring them down like 9/11...reply",
      "Pretty wild that MAME has been under active development for over 28 years with the core concept unchanged and no serious forks. It must have a very committed dev community.reply",
      "A C++ codebase with bonus non-C++ code that generates C++ code plus a build-process-that-generates-build processes all with maniacal inter-dependencies and a guy who insists on renaming everything and moving all the files around in git-destroying ways twice a year does indeed create a bit of a monks-in-the-caves vibe.reply"

Plus: PC Engine LaserActive support gets fast-tracked.Let me test out a theory here: If you're into emulation, you're into older video games, ergo you're into old stuff of all kinds. That means you, savvy, good-taste-having reader, will love this spread of photos I took in Tokyo last week at the National Film Archive of Japan, which has a small but lovely set of exhibits from the history of Japanese film. Since you like playing Super Nintendo games this is absolutely your shit, right? Right??Okay, I'll throw in a pic of some games to sweeten the deal.This issue is coming a week late as I was off to Japan last week for my first-ever visit to the Tokyo Game Show, and too busy working (and working at eating sushi) to squeeze in a newsletter. And it's coming late in the day Sunday \u2014 apologies! But patience pays off!!This issue's main story has been cookin' for a minute: last month the news landed that MAME had finally proper"

      "It's more complicated than \"this cable is good/bad\".  I had a suspicion about one of my cables for months, but just last week I confirmed it with a device that shows the volts/amps/watts/total kwh passing through it:  I have a USB-C cable with orientation.  Plugged in one way it transfers about 5x more power than the other way, and in the lower orientation it's low enough for the earbud case I use it with to not charge.reply",
      "My pixel 7 seems to have fully died out of the blue while charging two days ago, using a USB-C I thought might be getting a little flaky (connected to my mac, I'd occasionally get repeating disconnects). I wonder if something along these lines could be the culprit.I picked it up to find it had shut itself off, and now won't accept any charge, wireless or wired from any combination of power sources and cables. No signs of life at all.reply",
      "Could you elaborate on \"orientation\"?Let's say for C-to-C, are you talking about swapping the head/tail? Or simply connecting at a different angle (180 degrees)?reply",
      "Probably 180 degrees rotation in the plug (on either end). It commonly happens if one of the contacts or conductors for USB-PD signalling is not working correctly. (because of the way the pinout is designed to work either way around, the conductors that are used for signalling swap roles depending on the orientation)reply",
      "Yep, 180 degree rotation.reply",
      "Thats so weird, did you wind up coloring one end or something? I still wish we would add color to USB C wires like USB 3 has to emphasize features and expected uses. USB C was a much needed change from USB3 and 2 in terms of being reversible and superior but every manufacturer implements the cables differently and its confusing and hard to figure out which cable is best for what.reply",
      "Some cables write 10Gbps and similar near the end.reply",
      "The audio community love this sort of thing and will pay top dollar for unidirectional cables. Reproducible data proving the claims could be worth millions.reply",
      "well, if you listen to audio you would not want the audio to accidentally get confused and head back to where it came from halfway down the cable right?reply",
      "\u201cThis cut signal reflections, yielding brighter high hats without the brassiness of two-directional cabling. Bass was particularly clear and rumbly without the muddiness we heard from Monoprice cords.\u201dreply"
