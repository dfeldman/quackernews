They've been caught red-handed here doing the very things they routinely criticize others for.The right thing to do would be a mea-culpa style post and explain what went wrong, but I suspect the article will simply remain taken down and Ars will pretend this never happened.I loved Ars in the early years, but I'd argue since the Conde Nast acquisition in 2008 the site has been a shadow of its former self for a long time, trading on a formerly trusted brand name that recent iterations simply don't live up to anymore.reply",

      "Physicist here. Did you guys actually read the paper? Am I missing something? The \"key\" AI-conjectured formula (39) is an obvious generalization of (35)-(38), and something a human would have guessed immediately.(35)-(38) are the AI-simplified versions of (29)-(32). Those earlier formulae look formidable to simplify by hand, but they are also the sort of thing you'd try to use a computer algebra system for.I'm willing to (begrudgingly) admit the possibility for AI to do novel work, but this particular result does not seem very impressive.I picture ChatGPT as the rich kid whose parents privately donated to a lab to get their name on a paper for college admissions. In this case, I don't think I'm being too cynical in thinking that something similar is happening here and that the role of AI in this result is being well overplayed.reply",
      "The headline may make it seem like AI just discovered some new result in physics all on its own, but reading the post, humans started off trying to solve some problem, it got complex, GPT simplified it and found a solution with the simpler representation. It took 12 hours for GPT pro to do this. In my experience LLM\u2019s can make new things when they are some linear combination of existing things but I haven\u2019t been to get them to do something totally out of distribution yet from first principles.reply",
      "This is the critical bit (paraphrasing):Humans have worked out the amplitudes for integer n up to n = 6 by hand, obtaining very complicated expressions, which correspond to a \u201cFeynman diagram expansion\u201d whose complexity grows superexponentially in n. But no one has been able to greatly reduce the complexity of these expressions, providing much simpler forms. And from these base cases, no one was then able to spot a pattern and posit a formula valid for all n. GPT did that.Basically, they used GPT to refactor a formula and then generalize it for all n. Then verified it themselves.I think this was all already figured out in 1986 though: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.56... see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHV_amplitudesreply",
      "> I think this was all already figured out in 1986 though\n\nThey cite that paper in the third paragraph...  Naively, the n-gluon scattering amplitude involves order n! terms. Famously, for the special case of MHV (maximally helicity violating) tree amplitudes, Parke and Taylor [11] gave a simple and beautiful, closed-form, single-term expression for all n.\n\nIt also seems to be a main talking point.I think this is a prime example of where it is easy to think something is solved when looking at things from a high level but making an erroneous conclusion due to lack of domain expertise. Classic \"Reviewer 2\" move. Though I'm not a domain expert and so if there was no novelty over Parke and Taylor I'm pretty sure this will get thrashed in review.reply",

      "Alex,It's somewhat ironic that a web page about performant terminal user interfaces uses gratuitously complex CSS mask compositing and cubic gradients which reduce smooth scrolling on my 1 year-old, high-end Dell XPS laptop (>$3k) to Commodore 64 level (on default 'Balanced' battery mode). While it's pretty, it's also just a very subtle, non-critical background animation effect. Not being a CSS guru myself, here's what Gemini says:> \"Specifically, this is a Scrim or Easing Gradient. Instead of a simple transition between two colors, it uses 16 color stops to mimic a \"cubic-bezier\" mathematical curve. This creates a smoother, more natural fade than a standard linear gradient, but it forces the browser to calculate high-precision color math across the entire surface during every scroll repaint.\"My Firefox smooth scrolls like butter on thousands of pages, so you might want ask your web designer to test on non-Mac, iGPU laptops with hiDPI and consider the performance cost of web pages with always-running subtle background animations in a world of diverse hardware platforms. In case it helps, here's the animation with the gradient layers disabled so you can see all 6,400,000 pixels which are being recalculated every scroll line (https://i.imgur.com/He3RkEu.jpeg).reply",

      "I disagree, I think TUIs are a great fit in some problem domains.Think for instance the Debian package configuration dialogs -- they're far more comfortable than the same questions without a TUI, and still work over a serial console if you have to use one.For tools like various kinds of \"top\", there's many potential tools you can use to the same end and intentionally using one that draws CPU graphs over one that just displays a number. Graphs are much easier to interpret than a column of numbers.In many cases they're the optimal choice given some constraint -- like the desire to have minimal dependencies, working over SSH, and being usable without breaking the flow. Yeah, you could make a tunnel to a tool that runs a local webserver and delivers graphs by HTTP, but the ergonomics of that are terrible.reply",

It seems so simple and obvious in hindsight that a terminal-based agent would have a incredibly fast adoption curve among developers.Perhaps you have a similar feeling that the tool you're working on should have a TUI.

      "Here's the actual statement from the European Comission: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_...It's important to note they aren't creating laws against infinite scrolling, but are ruling against addictive design and pointing to infinite scrolling as an example of it. The wording here is fascinating, mainly because they're effectively acting as arbiters of \"vibes\". They point to certain features they'd like them to change, but there is no specific ruling around what you can/can't do.My initial reaction was that this was a terrible precedent, but after thinking on it more I asked myself, \"well what specific laws would I write to combat addictive design?\". Everything I thought of would have some way or workaround that could be found, and equally would have terrible consequences on situations where this is actually quite valuable. IE if you disallow infinite scrolling, what page sizes are allowed? Can I just have a page of 10,000 elements that lazy load?Regardless of your take around whether this is EU overreach, I'm glad they're not implementing strict laws around what you can/can't do - there are valuable situations for these UI patterns, even if in combination they can create addictive experiences. Still, I do think that overregulation here will lead to services being fractured. I was writing about this earlier this morning (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47005367), but the regulated friction of major platforms (ie discord w/ ID laws) is on a collision course with the ease of vibe coding up your own.

However, I should mention that I don't know much about this whole topic. I hadn't heard of E2B or Modal before.

      "I like the idea of grpc because I wanted the contract but I tried it on a small service and I think I would avoid it in the future. Too many rough edges and features I didnt really need. I was using it in Rust and python mainly (maybe it is better in Go?) but it had a whole bunch of google stuff in there I didnt need.- Configuring the python client with a json string that did not seem to have a documented schema- Error types that were overly general in some ways and overly specific in other ways- HAProxy couldn't easily health check the serviceThere were a few others that I cant remember because it was ~5 years ago. I liked the idea of the contract and protobuf seemed easy to write but had no need for client side dns load balancing and the like and was not working in GoLang.reply",
      "I've only enjoyed using Protobuf + gRPC after we've started using https://buf.build. Before that it was always a pain with Makefiles building obscure commands, then developers having different versions of the Protobuf compiler installed and all kinds of paper cuts like that.Now it's just \"buf generate\", every developer has the exact same settings defined in the repo and on the frontend side we are just importing the generated Typescript client and have all the types instantly available there. Also nice to have a hosted documentation to link people to.My experience is mostly with Go, Python and TS.reply",
      "I think connect-rpc[0] strikes a good balance between normal http apis, and gRPC. It allows protobuf as json. So you could think of it as an opinionated http api spec. A health check would be just a call to an url /something.v1.MyService/MyMethod -d { \"input\": \"something }.it works really well, and the tooling is pretty good, though it isn't that widely supported yet. Rust for one doesn't have an implementation. But I've been using it at work, and we basically haven't had any issues with it (go and typescript).But the good thing is that it can interoperate with normal grpc servers, etc. But that of course locks it into using the protobuf wireformat, which is part of the trouble ;)0: https://connectrpc.com/reply",

      "I build automation tools for bookkeepers and accountants. The thing I keep seeing firsthand is that automation doesn't eliminate the job - it eliminates the boring part of the job, and then the job description shifts.Before our tools: a bookkeeper spends 80% of their time on data entry and transaction categorisation, 20% on actually thinking about the numbers. After: those ratios flip. The bookkeeper is still there, still needed, but now they're doing the part that actually requires judgment.The catch nobody talks about is the transition period. The people who were really good at the mechanical part (fast data entry, memorised category codes) suddenly find their competitive advantage has evaporated. And the people who were good at the thinking part but slow at data entry are suddenly the most valuable people in the room. That's a real disruption for real humans even if the total number of jobs stays roughly the same.I think the \"AI won't take your job\" framing misses this nuance. It's not about headcount. It's about which specific skills get devalued and how quickly people can retool. In accounting at least, the answer is \"slowly\" because the profession moves at glacial speed.reply",
      "You\u2019re describing task reallocation, but the bigger second-order effect is where the firm can now source the remaining human judgment.AI reduces the penalty for weak domain context. Once the work is packaged like that, the \u201cthinking part\u201d becomes far easier to offshore because:- Training time drops as you\u2019re not teaching the whole craft, you\u2019re teaching exception-handling around an AI-driven pipeline.- Quality becomes more auditable because outputs can be checked with automated review layers.- Communication overhead shrinks with fewer back-and-forth cycles when AI pre-fills and structures the work.- Labor arbitrage expands and the limiting factor stops being \u201ccan we find someone locally who knows our messy process\u201d and becomes \u201cwho is cheapest who can supervise and resolve exceptions.\u201dSo yeah, the jobs mostly remain and some people become more valuable. But the clearing price for that labor moves toward the global minimum faster than it used to.The impact won\u2019t show up as \u201cno jobs,\u201d it is already showing up as stagnant or declining Western salaries, thinner career ladders, and more of the value captured by the firms that own the workflows rather than the people doing the work.reply",
      "I'd imagine that when the 80% of less productive time is automated, the market doesn't respond by demanding 80% more output. There's just 20% as much work either making this a part time job or more likely a much smaller workforce as the number of man*hours demanded by the market greatly reduces.reply",
      "> The bookkeeper is still there, still needed, but now they're doing the part that actually requires judgment.The argument might be fundamentally sound, but now we're automating the part that requires judgement. So if the accountants aren't doing the mechanical part or the judgement part, where exactly is the role going? Formalised reading of an AI provided printout?It seems quite reasonable to predict that humans just won't be able to make a living doing anything that involves screens or thinking, and we go back to manual labour as basically what humans do.reply",
      "I'm not very familiar with the field on a practical basis.What parts of the job require judgement that is resistant to automation? What percentage of customers need that?If the hours an accountant spends on a customer go from 4 per month to 1, do you reckon they can sustainably charge the same?reply",
      "Yeah bro, its been three years. We are just beginning. We will replace the vast majority of professional service workers in 10 years including lawyers as Ai shifts to local and moves away from the cloud.reply",
      "I was with the author on everything except one point: increasing automation will not leave us with such abundance that we never have to work again. We have heard that lie for over a century. The stream engine didn't do it, electricity didn't do it, computers didn't do it, the Internet didn't do it, and AI won't either. The truth is that as input costs drop, sales prices drop and demand increases - just like the paradox they referred to. However, it also tends to come with a major shift in wealth since in the short term the owners of the machines are producing more with less. As it becomes more common place and prices change they lose much of that advantage, but the workers never get that.reply",
      "I am also fairly certain that if we do arrive at some abundant utopia where you can wish for anything can have it arrive, society will collapse. It's just bringing up 7 billion (probably more) spoiled brats at that point of time. \nWork on its own is also a form of \"social control\". Idle hands are the devil's tools etc.reply",
      "Throughout history, big advances have come from humans having more \"idle time\", so we should be aiming for the population to be less busy as they can then hopefully focus on pursuing the arts or sciences.reply",
      "Big advances have also come from some of the most violent, destructive wars the planet has seen.I agree with you on principle, but I don't think it's straightforward as your point states.reply"

I wouldn't be surprised at all to find out that all of this was driven directly by a human. However, even if that's not the case, the blame still 100% lies at the feet of the irresponsible human who let this run wild and then didn't step up when it went off the rails.Either they are not monitoring their bot (bad) or they are and have chosen to remain silent while _still letting the bot run wild_ (also, very bad).The most obvious time to solve [0] this was when Scott first posted his article about the whole thing.

It is a snapshot of the living brain of neurology graduate Miguel Acevedo \u00c1lvarez (2010\u20132073), taken by researchers at the Uplift Laboratory at the University of New Mexico on August 1, 2031. Though it was not the first successful snapshot taken of the living state of a human brain, it was the first to be captured with sufficient fidelity that it could be run in simulation on computer hardware without succumbing to cascading errors and rapidly crashing.
