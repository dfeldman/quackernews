It reminds me a bit of Sky by thatgamecompanyEdit 2: for the author, I noticed several players approached me and tried to communicate. Please explore games like Journey (thatgamecompany) to see different ways people communicate without chatting. People can help each other, veterans can guide newbies all without using words. Every time I met a player in the game back in the days, they sent me a heartfelt message.reply",

Please do the backward pass when it\u2019s published.As a fellow Tri Dao groupie and lucky duck who gets to build on Hopper/Blackwell clusters, I find it amazing how difficult it is becoming to write kernels that saturate GPU hardware.When I squint, there appears to be a trend emerging across work like FA4, monolithic (mega) kernels, etc. Namely, a subversion of the classic CUDA programming model in the form of fine grained task based parallelism, managed entirely in \u201cuser space\u201d.Not exactly sure what\u2019s ahead but I\u2019m strapping in for a wild ride\u2026reply",

      "Hey, one of the authors here!Reductively, software engineering means taking an idea and mapping it into code. So one form of \"reverse\" engineering would be taking the code and extracting the ideas. That's what we did here.Because the source is public, there's quite a lot to work with from the start -- the warp specializations are named and there are helpful comments in many places.But for many components, we didn't have much. Maybe the clearest case of \"reverse engineering\" explained in the post is with the cubic approximation for the rational part of the exponentiation. That required staring at some inline assembly and doing math.reply",

These kernels are used in the attention layers of Transformer neural networks. Along with more standard matrix multiplications, these calculations are the primary bottlenecks in contemporary generative AI workloads. Billions of dollars and gigawatts of power are being expended on GPUs to run more of these calculations faster. And Flash Attention 4 is the way to run lots of them as fast as possible. This blog post explains how it works.The new FA4 kernel is optimized for Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell Streaming Multiprocessor architecture and achieves a reported ~20% speedup over the previous state-of-the-art, the attention kernels in Nvidia\u2019s cudnn library. cudnn kernels are closed source, so Jensen only knows what\u2019s going on in there.There\u2019s also no official technical report on how FA4 works yet.

I feel small, irrelevant, in the face of brutal, powerful nature.And believe me, it is a feeling that is overwhelming. But never have I perceived it as something negative. The opposite was true. Feeling small made me feel calm, embracing that that was the right spot for me as part of God's creation. Suddenly, all those dark clouds that followed me everywhere I went back home were...

      "It's the real deal, lots of challenges with high emf. Not surprisingly a very common failure mode is that if you induce currents in the coils of the brushless motors their controllers which are using back emf to set their waveform phase get it wrong and the motors stop spinning, spin backwards, and sometimes just go back and forth like tiny washing machine motors.Shielding helps of course, adds expense and adds weight, the two things that cut into how many you can make for $X and how far they can fly.Counter drone systems in battle are going to be a thing, things like the Danish 'bird' RADAR sees them easily enough[1], targeting them with EMF just needs an antenna, generator, and some clever electronics.This becomes more important as the drones become more autonomous because if there is no operator to 'jam', electronic counter measures are not as effective.[1] https://www.weibelradars.com/drone-detection/reply",
      "> Not surprisingly a very common failure mode is that if you induce currents in the coils of the brushless motorsNo, that doesn't happen.  Currents can be induced in the wires to the motors, but not in the motors themselves.  For one thing, the outside surface of the motors is the aluminum rotor which is an extremely effective faraday cage.  For another, coils don't act like antennas.  Loops of wire in an electric field have the exact same voltage difference as a straight wire.> Shielding helps of course, adds expense and adds weight, the two things that cut into how many you can make for $X and how far they can fly.Shielding adds virtually zero weight; carrying a spool of fiber optic cable adds a lot of weight.  All the drones in Ukraine right now are fiber optic but most of them are unshielded... the reason why is not that shielding is heavy, it's just that there are lots of jammers but very few truck-sized weapons intended to totally disable drones.That's also assuming it would even work on a drone without an antenna.  If these weapons are not relatively broad-spectrum then they will be very sensitive to the particulars of the circuitry, and they won't always work.reply",

      "Thinking evolved in creatures only to help correlate the past to future, using some memory from the past. The correlations and responses gradually get codified into instincts and genes to help bypass the thinking, which is costly and slow.Human thinking is considered a bad situation if the thinking goes beyond what's immediately needed, or if it makes the mind unavailable to process inputs from the senses. Any person who is lost in thought is in reality suffering from a lack of coordination between their body and mind, as their mind is no longer serving their body. It is not unusual that thinking considered same as worrying, as it indicates that person is unable to process information or concerned about something.reply",
      "There's no way for evolution to read the history of how an organism responded to something and codify it into an instinct. All it can operate on is whether the organism reproduced. If a tendency to mull things over made the organism survive, that's what gets codified, not the actions it chose.The whole advantage of thinking is being able to select adaptive responses to situations that change too rapidly for evolution to ever hard code as instincts.reply",
      "The history of an individual organism can be read by future generations. But it's through epigenetics, not genetics - adding methyl groups to the DNA, which influence gene expression. These are inherited, but the changes only last a few generations and have limited (though not zero!) impact on evolution since they don't seem to persist in the genetic code.Beyond that, culture has a huge role to play. Many complex lifeforms learn how to survive from their parents and peers. Those groups with less adaptive strategies will be wiped out. For many organisms, they are not \"thinking\" per se, they are processing sensory data in the way they've been taught. The \"thinking\" was done by multilevel selection, weeding out ineffective strategies.IOW, no organism technically needs to think through a problem from first principles. There's always some cultural heuristic to fall back on.Second paragraph is spot on. The search space is far too large for evolution to provide direct solutions for every challenge a multicellular lifeform could face. General solutions rule. But it's likely that cultural adaptation plays a larger role than individual cognition.One could argue the prokaryotic life is 100% instinct though - adaptive responses seem to be pretty rare in bacteria.reply",

      "This is clearly not true: once thinking emerges in a species, it can be applied for an infinite number of situations that can't be codified into instincts because they are unique. Each battle site is unique, it has a certain topology, each battle involves a particular snapshot of men with certain equipment, gear, training and morale etc. The commander who can reason generally about battles will win on average against the commander that can simply \"feel\" the right moment to attack, if that intuition is just evolutionary inheritance from a long line of warriors who survived very different battles in their time.So the advantage even against members of your own species is substantial and quickly leads to reinforcing and spreading of the thinking gene.reply",
      "That is if your thinking gene is optimized enough. Thinking is expensive energy wise so the cost of thinking is balanced by the amount of food that thinking allows you to gather. With the randomness of nature a highly intelligent subspecies could go extinct while a 'dumber' subspecies could survive a food shortage event if the power requirements are too high to think.reply",

      "And yet nature has managed to find a niche for this dysfunctional behaviour as a subset of such individuals have used the extra useless brain cycles to produce new knowledge and ways of thinking that transformed the societies in which they lived giving them an edge over competition and improved the odds of the survival of their kind.reply",
      "Think of it as overcoming a local maxima. Thinking is expensive so requires more time getting food to supply that thinking, and then evolve that thinking to be smarter over time. The difficult part is getting thru the early bottleneck where your thinking isn't supplying massive amounts of excess calories that can be used on exploratory thinking.reply",
      "I\u2019ve always felt it\u2019s unfair that people attribute the \u201cSystem 1/System 2\u201d dual-reasoning idea to KT. Their research was mostly behavioral, and many of their classic psychology experiments (Linda problem, law of small numbers, representativeness bias, etc.) never mentioned two systems. The dual-process framework only emerged around the 2000s in cognitive psychology and neuroscience (e.g., Jonathan Evans, Keith Stanovich), which later provided brain-based evidence for it.When the book came out, KT basically retrofitted their earlier behavioral work into this newer two-system framework. The book made the distinction famous, but that wasn\u2019t really KT\u2019s original contribution. Their biggest impact was bringing psychology into economics, i.e., prospect theory, alternative utility functions, and ultimately the creation of behavioral economics. I think people often don\u2019t give enough credit to what they actually pioneered, and instead celebrate them for concepts they didn\u2019t really originate.reply"
