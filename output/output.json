Which severely limits possible use cases.Schema management is only a small part of the problem, and I don\u2019t think this tool handles data migrations. E.g. if I reshape a JSONB column into something more structured, I don\u2019t think it would be able to handle that.

Declarative schema management is best used combined with a Git repo.In the big picture, declarative schema management has lots of advantages around avoiding/solving schema drift, either between environments (staging vs prod) or between shards in a sharded setup (among thousands of shards, one had a master failure at an inopportune time).It's also much more readable to have the \"end state\" in your repo at all times, rather than a sequence of ALTERs.There are a bunch of other advantages; I have an old post about this topic here: https://www.skeema.io/blog/2019/01/18/declarative/It's also quite essential when maintaining nontrivial stored procedures.

I'm the author of Skeema [1] which includes a lot of functionality that sqldef lacks, but at the cost of being 100% MySQL/MariaDB-specific. Some other DB-specific options in this space include Stripe's pg-schema-diff [2], results [3], stb-tester's migrator for sqlite [4], among many others over the years.The more comprehensive solutions from ByteBase, Atlas, Liquibase, etc tend to support multiple databases and multiple paradigms.And then over in Typescript ORM world, the migrators in Prisma and Drizzle support a \"db push\" declarative concept. (fwiw, I originated that paradigm; Prisma directly copied several aspects of `skeema push`, and then Drizzle copied Prisma. But ironically, if I ever complete my early-stage next-gen tool, it uses a different deployment paradigm.)[1] https://github.com/skeema/skeema/[2] https://github.com/stripe/pg-schema-diff[3] https://github.com/djrobstep/results[4] https://david.rothlis.net/declarative-schema-migration-for-s...reply",

Sometimes you have to zoom in but this is easy and natural.The colors are a nice addition but hardly the main attraction.The backlight makes it excellent for writing at morning or night in bed without disturbing the S.O..The minimalism is a feature.It does okay for PDFs, but that is far from its purpose.I use it daily for notes, task management, and little printable logic games.My only minor nits are: changing pens (for logic games mostly) takes more taps than on the RM2. The palm detection is somewhat lacking compared to the RM2 - it tends to change pages or change the zoom level unintentionally when writing on certain parts of the screen. This could be more about my usage of it. I really wish I could add links and/or a table of contents to notes on the device. I wish the zoom level would stick between pages or could be locked in for a document.reply",
      "Same, I already had a reMarkable tablet and got the reMarkable Paper Pro Move as an impulse purchase (ignoring its ridiculously high price) expecting to return it within the 50-day return window, but the fact that it fits in my pocket (or \u201cmost of my pockets\u201d, as you said) has made a huge difference in how much I use it and how I spend my time. The sync is also nice (I think it works up to some limit even without a paid subscription, though it turned out I had one grandfathered in); I can basically send webpages I\u2019m reading to it using the browser extension (at least on desktop). On mobile it\u2019s a bit more annoying, but e.g. I\u2019ve printed long newsletters from the Gmail to PDF (paper size A6) and imported the PDF onto it.It\u2019s perfectly adequate for writing on, but so far I\u2019ve almost never used the fact that it has (a rudimentary set of) colours, though.reply",
      "The Paper Pro switched to AES like every other recent tablet out there instead of keeping the Wacom EMR, and it definitely takes a hit in almost every metric you can think of.

      "What are the usual complaints?reply",
      "Needs a subscription for sync, the sync system is pretty basic, the web/desktop experience is poor, no support for things like Google Drive or other cloud storage, and generally very limited software experience on the device.(This is not to say I fully agree with these, but these are the criticisms I see a lot online)reply",

I can't believe how heavily I have to press to get full line width on many tools, it's harder than I press when I use an eraser on a stubborn mark in real life.Responsiveness wise... the latency on common actions has increased incredibly in the past couple of years. Not pen drawing, that's still excellent, but general UI navigation and recognizing taps and long presses and whatnot have really gotten bad.  At this point I've got it rolled back to 2.x almost all the time, which is also a whole lot more moddable than 3.x. I like many of the UI changes and additions in 3 (except infinitely vertically scrollable stuff, that keeps screwing up and interpreting taps and swipes as vertical scrolls when there's absolutely no additional content to show, so it just stops responding for a second while it scrolls three pixels down, and I would be thrilled if I could disable it completely), but not at the cost of responsiveness.reply",

      "Cool project. Thanks for doing a write-up that includes so much detail.I do a lot of PCB review for students and makers, so if you're interested I wrote up some notes. Consider this an incomplete review because I only had so much free time, but hopefully this information can be helpful for your next rev or next project.Design:- Add ESD protection to all pins exposed by connectors and around the buttons. A simple TVS will work. However, the capacitance of the TVS needs to be small enough to minimize burden on your higher speed lines like USB and VGA. I'd use a cheap TVS for the low speed pins and then maybe look at some dedicated USB-HS protection parts and then just re-use those on the VGA lines. The USB3300 part you're using looks to have some minimal built-in ESD protection but as you observed it's probably not enough for real world use.- Consider a buffer between your resistor DAC and the output. This could be an op-amp or a dedicated buffer chip. This will let the resistor DAC operate without significant load, isolated from the cable. You can then put a 75 ohm resistor in series with the buffer output to get optimal impedance matching with the 75-ohm VGA cable and load. You can get away with resistors connected straight to the VGA cable for demo purposes, but having it properly buffered and impedance matched will clean up the edges even further.- Look into the design of an R-2R DAC as an alternative to the weighted-summing configuration you've used. You would want 0.1% resistors at 8-bit depth but you'd only have to buy and manage 2 resistor values (R and 2R) which is helpful when doing hand assembly.- Better yet: This project is a good place to use a real DAC chip. Resistor DACs are cool to play with and useful for ultra-cheap demo boards where manufacturing cost is a high priority (Like the RP2040 VGA demo) but for a hand-assembled project like this a good DAC chip is great choice. It would shrink your PCB, reduce assembly time, and allow you to choose a physically smaller MCU package because you don't need 24 IO pins for the resistors.Schematic:- When using hierarchical schematics it's a good practice to avoid putting ICs and components in the root sheet. I suggest adding additional sheets for the MCU and other parts, then connect the blocks in the root. Treat the root page like a block diagram.- KiCAD's bus functionality could help reduce a lot of the pins going into your blocks, like USB_D[0:7] and VGA_R[0:7]- Breaking up that big STM symbol into a couple parts would be a good way to learn how to use KiCAD's symbol editor and would allow everything to fit on standard A4 sheets- Don't hesitate to add notes to the schematic that might be helpful during debugging, assembly, or for your future self when you return to the project.- I like to do a cleanup pass on schematics to make sure all labels are readable and there's enough space to comfortably see everything. It's a good practice to get into and pays off when you're tired from a long debugging session and trying to read a schematic. I suggest using the empty space on some of your pages to space components out more so no text is overlapping or hard to read.PCB:- You used 0.15mm (5.9 mil) traces almost everywhere. It's best to avoid using small traces unless you have to. You want to stay away from the minimum trace/space of your PCB manufacturer by default and reserve those for only the places where you need it. It will improve yields and make rework easier. Many of your traces could be 0.25mm or 0.5mm without any problem.- Likewise, avoid letting traces run too close to pads unless you really need to. It's okay when you need to squeeze a trace into a narrow spot, but by default you should try to give as much room between pads and traces and between adjacent traces as you can. The tighter the spacing, the easier it becomes to accidentally short something out during assembly.- Similar story with vias: Try not to use the absolute smallest vias everywhere when you have space.- A lot of your vias are grouped together in a way that creates large slots in your ground plane. This doesn't matter too much at the low speeds you're working with, but it's good practice to avoid creating large cutouts in ground planes. The return current has to flow somewhere and those big slots will force it to take a longer path, which increases emissions and distorts high speed signals.reply",

Eventually we wanted to move to a more powerful computer, but we needed a way to connect it to the display. Off-hand, I mentioned that I could build a CRT display adapter that interfaces with a normal computer over USB. This is that project.The CRT in the RCade has a JAMMA connector, and Frank bought a converter that goes between VGA and JAMMA.You might think we could just use an off-the-shelf VGA adapter to drive it at this point, but it's not that simple. The CRT runs at a weird resolution; We started with 320x240 but eventually wanted to target 336x262, which is super non-standard. Even 320x240 is unattainable by most display adapters, which typically can't go below 640x480. A custom solution would allow us to output any arbitrary resolution we wante"

      "The biggest issue I see is Microsoft's entire mentality around AI adoption that focuses more on \"getting the numbers up\" then actually delivering a product people want to use.Most of the announcements I hear about Copilot, it's always how they've integrated it into some other piece of software or cut a deal with yet another vendor to add it to that vendors product offering. On the surface there's nothing wrong with doing that but that just seems to be the ONLY thing Microsoft is focused on.Worse yet, most of these integrations seem like a exercise in ticking boxes rather than actually thinking through how integrating Copilot into a product will actually improve user experience. A great example was someone mentioned that Copilot was now integrated into the terminal app but beyond an icon + a chat window, there is zero integration.Overall, MS just reeks of an organization that is cares more about numbers on a dashboard and pretty reports than they are on what users are actually experiencing.reply",
      "I expect this is the crux of the problem.There aren't any \"AI\" products that have enough value.Compare to their Office suite, which had 100 - 150 engineers working on it, every business paid big $$ for every employee using it, and once they shipped install media their ongoing costs were the employees. With a 1,000,000:1 ratio of users to developers and an operating expense (OpEx) of engineers/offices/management. That works as a business.But with \"AI\", not only is it not a product in itself, it's a feature to a product, but it has OpEx and CapEx costs that dominate the balance sheet based on their public disclosures. Worse, as a feature, it demonstrably harms business with its hallucinations.In a normal world, at this point companies would say, \"hmm, well we thought it could be amazing but it just doesn't work as a product or a feature of a product because we can't sell it for enough money to both cover its operation, and its development, and the capital expenditures we need to make every time someone signs up.

AI is like that today, a pretty amazing technology that at some point will probably revolutionize a lot of things we do, but the hype level is as far over its utility as the Internet hype was in 1995.

      "I did something similar last summer. My Craftsman LT1400 uses the standard 500cc Briggs motor and that motor has some tragic design flaws that make it grenade itself roughly once a season. I went through a couple of these motors rebuilding them (correctly) until I gave up.I ripped the tractor down the the frame and removed most parts. Got $40 Ryobi walk behind mower motors (42V which is really 36V), some scooter controllers, and pulleys. I used two scooter Li ion batteries but I should have just gotten three large lead acid 12V batteries for more capacity. Still, I can mow for an hour or so and get almost an acre done which includes some hills per charge. It took about 8 total days to build and about $800.The way I set it up is that I have one motor drive the wheels and two more motors on the deck directly driving the blades. The belt system the ICE motor version had was insanely inefficient. This system has like 20% of the power but mowed better and is way more reliable. For $150 I could get a solar array and controller to charge the batteries and never pay for anything but belt and blade replacements for life.The hardest part of the build was lining up the mounting of the drive motor and wiring up all the safety systems (brake sensor, seat sensor, etc). The kicker is that this is a way better product than what I can buy commercially unless I get into the $5k+ territory and is completely user serviceable. No part here is more than $100 and they all readily available. The tractor has enough torque to push my huge picnic table around while I am riding it. I might try seeing if I can plow snow with it next winter.reply",

The quadratic time seems inherent to the problem.Indeed, there are lower bounds showing that sub n^2 algorithms can't work: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13214reply",
      "The paper says that:> In practice, we find that four Taylor terms (P = 4) suffice for\nrecovering conventional attention with elementwise errors of approximately the same magnitude as Float16 resolution, acceptable for many AI applications.ie., the claim is that this method reproduces the results of conventional attention, up to float16 numerical precision.reply",

      "The method is more general. The github repository's first example is with eight Taylor terms (P = 8).reply",
      "I'm clueless about this whole thing, but from my EE education I remember that in general:Taylor approximations converge slowly in terms of error if the function they're representing is discontinuous (the error disappears quadratically if continuous, linearly if not), and they tend to create highly energetic swings near discontinuties (similarly to Fourier series with Gibbs oscillations).Moreover,  Taylor series are inherently nonlinear, and much of the mathematical toolset around AI assumes general linearity (cue linear algebra), with the exception of sigmoids , and going beyond cubic approximations tends to  make errors worse (as expressed in SNR).reply",

Fundamentally, if every token wants to be able to look at every previous token without loss of information, it must be O(n^2); N tokens looking at N tokens is quadratic.

      "I'd be surprised if there was a single American who had the CIA Factbook as the deciding factor in determining their vote.  It being shutdown is more evidence of how broken the American political system is rather than an indication of the will of the people.reply",
      "As a single issue, probably not. However, the meta-issue that they did vote for was eliminating anything the government pays for (other than military, ICE, or related to drilling oil)reply",
      "Right, World Factbook single issue voters probably don't exist.That aside, something that frustrates me about US politics is that I rarely see any evidence of consideration given to taxpayers who want value for their money as opposed to having their taxes cut.I pay taxes here. I like it when those  taxes spent on wildly ROI-positive initiatives like the World Factbook.The Trump lot appear to be killing off a huge range of useful things that I like getting in exchange for the taxes I pay.reply",
      "Sure, but this is based on a fundamental trust in governments ability to spend money effectively. The ineffective spending has been in the news way more than the effective spending, so some people take this to mean all of the spending is ineffective.I don\u2019t know how to square this skepticism of government against very vocal \u201cpatriotism\u201d coming from the trump camp, but humans can contain multitudes, I guess?reply",

The World Factbook served the Intelligence Community and the general public as a longstanding, one-stop basic reference about countries and communities around the globe. Let\u2019s take a quick look into the history of The World Factbook. \u00a0Over many decades, The World Factbook evolved from a classified to unclassified, hardcopy to electronic product that added new categories, and even new global entities.

I tried to make them pretty, or weird, or just break the systems.  Occasionally, it was so interesting I'd end up looking at the data / formulae that lead to the graph / design.  Great creative space to be in for jumping back and forth between math and art.reply",
