      "I am not a lawyer or diplomat or expert on trade, but I can make some general observations from an American/Western perspective:First, the sanctions on Iran are such that any partnership with an Iranian person for business reasons is effectively impossible in the West, without the resources of a multi-million or billion-dollar company to circumvent them. The author says \"I am not looking for anyone to bypass sanctions\" but that is very obviously exactly what they are asking for.Second, circumventing sanctions is illegal, and people regularly go to prison or are given massive monetary fines for this. OP, I don't question your motives, but you need to understand that people have literally gone to prison and lost their whole livelihoods for doing exactly what you are asking.Therefore, posting this on a Western platform (Github) and advertising it on a Western message board (HN) is unlikely to help. I don't think the author's intentions are poor; I think they may simply not understand the intensity of the legal regime that makes working with them impossible.There is also the matter of Westerners' general opinions on Iran, which - general attitudes of multiculturalism and tolerance nonwithstanding - is typically quite negative. The sanctions didn't come from nowhere.I would recommend the author look into partnerships with persons from countries that are more sympathetic to their situation. The ones with strong tech industries would be Russia, China, and India. Vietnam is another example of a country with some tech industry which also has mostly positive relationships with Western countries, these days. I realize this is not as attractive as the West, but there are good people even in places whose governments I may as a Westerner may not particularly like, and English is a lingua franca the world over. I'd strongly recommend those places as a starting point.reply",
      "Thank you for this thoughtful response. You're raising legitimate concerns I may not fully understand.Let me clarify my understanding (and please correct me if I'm wrong):My assumption was that a structure like this would be legal:\n- Partner in US/UK registers their own company\n- Opens Stripe under their company name\n- Hires me as a remote contractor (like any distributed team)\n- I hold equity as a foreign shareholder (which I thought was legal for non-US persons)Is your point that even this structure violates sanctions because I'm Iranian? Or that the risk/complexity makes it impractical for anyone without massive legal resources?I genuinely don't want anyone to break the law. If what I'm proposing is illegal even in the structure above, I need to understand that.Re: Russia/China/India - that's solid advice I hadn't seriously considered. Russia and China have their own complexities, but India makes a lot of sense. Do you know if Indian tech companies face similar restrictions when working with Iranians, or is it more open?I appreciate you taking the time to explain this clearly rather than just dismissing it. If the Western partnership path is genuinely impossible (not just hard), I need to know that.reply",
      "> My assumption was that a structure like this would be legal: - Partner in US/UK registers their own company - Opens Stripe under their company name - Hires me as a remote contractor (like any distributed team) - I hold equity as a foreign shareholder (which I thought was legal for non-US persons)That structure is explicitly illegal because you are an Iranian national.

They are regularly found out and caught and prosecuted:> Do you know if Indian tech companies face similar restrictions when working with Iranians, or is it more open?Sorry, I'm not Indian and have no knowledge of Indian laws. I would strongly advise you seek legal counsel from a person familiar with them, preferably a barrister/solicitor (in Indian terms).> If the Western partnership path is genuinely impossible (not just hard), I need to know that.For all intents and purposes, for you, it is. I'm sorry, genuinely, that our countries are in this position with regards to each other. It isn't your fault, but it is how it is.Editing to add: the ONLY exception I can think of to this would be if you flee Iran, plead for and are granted asylum in the United States or a third country with better relationships to it. This is extraordinarily hard, and possibly a violation of Iranian law for me to even suggest to you.reply",
      "UPDATE: I'm pulling back from seeking Western partnerships.Multiple commenters have explained that even the \"contractor + equity\" structure violates sanctions and is illegal. I genuinely didn't understand this - I thought it was a gray area. It's not.I'm not asking anyone to break the law or take legal risk. That was naive on my part.Based on helpful suggestions in this thread, I'm now focusing on:\n- India (no sanctions, large tech industry)\n- UAE/Dubai (open to Iranian nationals)\n- Turkey (regional tech hub)\n- Singapore (need to research legality)If you're from one of these countries and interested in partnership, feel free to reach out: EchenDeligani@gmail.comTo everyone who took the time to explain sanctions compliance: thank you.

I dont know how this all works, but there is a reasonably large size group of Iranian expats in my country (canada), many of them with jobs in the tech sector.

      "This is interesting for sure. Kudos for bringing this capability to the web!One issue the demos reveal is, it doesn't _feel_ like the web. That is, I can't hit Ctrl+F to find text on a page. I can't select text with my cursor. I can't copy the address of a hyperlink. On my phone, I can't hard press on an image and share it to others. Screen readers can't handle it. I can't press a shortcut key to make everything larger.These all may seem pedantic, but they contribute to the feeling \"this is not the real web.\"This is the same problem with Java applets in the late '90s, Flash and Silverlight in the early 2000s. They are islands of richness within a web page, but those islands are, well, opaque to browsers, search engines, and virtually all web tooling.reply",
      "That's not pedantic at all! Indeed, without these capabilities, it is by some definition not the real web.This hits into that concept of what exactly the \"web\" is. Is it just a media transport system? Or is it something more than that. Of course, we could cite Tim Berners-Lee here or Roy Fielding in this discussion.But at minimum, I think a lot of us are tired of the app-lification of the web and somewhat wish we could have a bit of the old.reply",
      "It's also an interesting question, why, in traditional rich desktop applications, I can't say I have ever missed the ability to select and copy text from the UI chrome - whereas on the web I'd definitly miss it and in badly designed mobile apps, I often do.I think some part of UI design degraded with the web, where there used to be a clearer distinction between \"user data\" and \"app chrome\" areas than there is today.I'd also like if we could get back to selections of more complex data types at some point and not just treat everything as text. UI toolkits have all kinds of lists and treeviews to model selectable entities, whereas in the browser, there just a single huge wall of text for everything.reply",
      "IMHO there's no gatekeeper of what the \"real\" web is or should be. It grew organically - regular people building things they liked or needed. It's certainly more of a life necessity than it used to be, but that happened organically too.I know there are strongly held opinions about this, but I for one see no reason why the \"application web\" can't peacefully coexist, and interlink with, the document web. In my opinion it therefore makes sense to allow for different models for the application web, ones that do not revolve around a document.On the other hand, if we're just bashing on javascript being the lingua franca of the web, that's a train I'll happily board!reply",

However, there is no way for me to view the whole image. Either it is cutoff at the bottom, or it starts horizontally scrolling. Switching from vertical to horizontal scrolling is awkward and I just want to skip the gallery.scrolling on that page feels slow, sluggish, and if you switch to spacebar, you actually miss significant content since it only loads/becomes visible halfway into the page.Like others have said, dust is a huge issue. Some film labs cut  film into short strips. some film is just a single image (for example if previously cut to fit into slides).The film is designed to form into a coil. So, if there's grit or any hard material you'll end up with scratches on the negative itself.--is it only 35mm as well? I don't think I see any mention of formats it supports.

But for instagram, they are close enough.However scanning more than a few pictures is a massive pain in the arse.

      "I read the whole thing and at first glance, it seems like a whole NIH list of wishes. We already have alternatives to the terminal, but the article have no mentions of them:- Emacs (inherited from lisp machines?). A VM which is powered by lisp. The latter make it easy to redefine function, and commands are just annotated functions. As for output, we have the buffer, which can be displayed in windows, which are arranged in a tiling manner in a frame. And you can have several frames. As the buffer in a window as the same grid like basis as the terminal emulator, we can use cli as is, including like a terminal emulator (vterm, eat, ansi-term,...). You can eschew the terminal flow and use the REPL flow instead (shell-mode, eshell,...). There's support for graphics, but not a full 2d context.- Acme: Kinda similar to emacs, but the whole thing is mostly about interactive text. Meaning any text can be a command. We also have the tiling/and stacking windows things that displays those texts.I would add Smalltalk to that, but it's more of an IDE than a full computing environment. But to extend it to the latter would still be a lower effort than what is described in the article.reply",
      "Emacs also has Org-mode and org-babel, which can work a lot like a Jupyter notebook, and can even talk to jupyter kernels. I do a lot in Emacs, especially now that I'm comfortable with GPTel.I open a poorly aligned, pixelated PDF scan of a 100+ year old Latin textbook in Emacs, mark a start page, end page, and Emacs lisp code shells out to qpdf to create a new smaller pdf from my page range to /tmp, and then adds the resulting PDF to my LLM context. Then my code calls gptel-request with a custom prompt and I get an async elisp callback with the OCR'd PDF now in Emacs' org-mode format, complete with italics, bold, nicely formatted tables, and with all the right macrons over the vowels, which I toss into a scratch buffer. Now that the chapter from my textbook in a markup format, I can select a word, immediately pop up a Latin-to-English dictionary entry or select a whole sentence to hand to an LLM to analyze with a full grammatical breakdown while I'm doing my homework exercises. This 1970s vintage text editor is also a futuristic language learning platform, it blows my mind.reply",

      "> It does this using (mostly) standard features built-in to the terminal and shell (a custom DCS): you can read their explanation here. It's possible to do this less invasively using OSC 133 escape codes; I'm not sure why Warp didn't do this, but that's ok.Independent of the rest, I would love for more terminal emulators to support OSC 133.reply",
      "Great thought provoking article! Indeed, typing commands on the command line feels primitive like typing code into interactive interpreters (python, irb, etc.). Those are primitive REPLs.With lisp REPLs one types in the IDE/editor having full highlighting, completions and code intelligence. Then code is sent to REPL process for evaluation. For example Clojure has great REPL tooling.A variation of REPL is the REBL (Read-Eval-Browse Loop) concept, where instead of the output being simply printed as text, it is treated as values that can be visualized and browsed using graphical viewers.Existing editors can already cover the runbooks use case pretty well. Those can be just markdown files with key bindings to send code blocks to shell process for evaluation. It works great with instructions in markdown READMEs.The main missing feature editor-centric command like workflow I can imagine is the history search. It could be interesting to see if it would be enough to add shell history as a completion source. Or perhaps have shell LSP server to provide history and other completions that could work across editors?reply",

But after I played with Polyglot Notebooks[1], I pretty much just abandoned that experiment. There's a _lot_ of UI that needs to be written to build a notebook-like experience. But the Polyglot notebooks took care of that by just converting the commandline backend to a jupyter kernel.I've been writing more and more script-like experiments in those ever since.

      "My personal opinion-psuedoterminals should be enhanced to provide some mechanism for sending out-of-band data, like the existing TIOCPKT but on steroids. Maybe something like\u2026 if both ends support it, they can exchange JSON-RPC messages over this out-of-band channel, with it being possible to discover if the other side supports this or not. Possibly this is just a new TIOC* ioctlWhy? Well one reason is escape sequences are really limited and messy. This would enable everyone to gradually and backward-compatibly transition to a more modern alternative. Once you have a JSON-RPC channel, the two ends can use it to negotiate what specific features they support. It would be leveraging patterns already popular with LSP, MCP, etc. And it would be mostly in userspace, only a small kernel enhancement would be required (the kernel doesn\u2019t have to actually understand these JSON-RPC messages just offer a side channel to convey them).I suppose you could do it without any kernel change if you just put a Unix domain socket in an environment variable: but that would be more fragile, some process will end up with your pty but missing the environment variable or vice versaActually I\u2019d add this out-of-band JSON-RPC feature to pipes too, so if I run \u201cfoo | bar\u201d, foo and bar can potentially engage in content/feature negotiation with each otherreply"

      "A few years ago I wrote a mobile app for use by patients of local doctors' surgeries. This meant a higher-than-average proportion of older, less tech-savvy users.There was a flood of complaints about the OS-native date pickers, along the lines of: \"There's no way to set the year! To get to my birth year, I had to tap the previous-month arrow 720 times!\" (It seems people actually did this.)This is what happens in the real world when Flat Design takes over UI controls. On both iOS and Android (a few years back, I don't know whether they've been improved now), the year just looked like a heading. Nothing whatsoever suggested it was a tappable UI element.Now that mobile OS UI decisions are seemingly led entirely by aesthetics, instead of being run by a seasoned UX researcher like Don Norman, using an OS-native datepicker leaves the usability of our apps entirely at the mercy of what they choose to mess up next.I used Pikaday on a few websites years ago. We're told these tools are now obsolete - I wish that were true.(Changing the app to use textbox-dropdown-textbox for date-monthname-year - this is in the UK - stopped any further such complaints.)reply",

      "Date picker widgets do not solve any validation problem, because validation happens on the server side and client input is not to be trusted.reply",
      "After dealing with datepickers for (checks notes) two decades, my best advice is to use the damn input type text with a placeholder showing a format, then saving it as a string in whatever that ISO that makes sense is called.Everything else is asking for endless trouble and pain with browsers, a11y, locales and what not.

      "From Wikipedia:> The Hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) algorithm is a graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search technique used in many vector databases.[1] Nearest neighbor search without an index involves computing the distance from the query to each point in the database, which for large datasets is computationally prohibitive. For high-dimensional data, tree-based exact vector search techniques such as the k-d tree and R-tree do not perform well enough because of the curse of dimensionality.reply",
      "At very high scale, there's less usage of graphs. Or there's a set of clustering on top of graphs.Graphs can be complex to build and rebalance. Graph-like data structures with a thing, then a pointer out to another thing, aren't that cache friendly.Add to that, people almost always want to *filter* vector search results. And this is a huge blindspot for consumers and providers. It's where the ugly performance surprises come from. Filtered HNSW isn't straightforward, and requires you to just keep traversing the graph looking for results that satisfy your filter.HNSW came out of a benchmark regime where we just indexed some vectors and tried to only maximize recall for query latency. It doesn't take into account the filtering / indexing almost everyone wants.Turbopuffer, for example, doesn't use graphs at all, it uses SPFresh. And they recently got 200ms latency on 100B vectors.https://turbopuffer.com/docs/vectorreply",
      "There is an entire section of the post about that. I believe that's more the illusion of a problem because of product design issues than a real challenge since far results that match the filter are totally useless.reply",
      "I'm facing the problem you describe daily. It's especially bad because it's very difficult for me to predict if the set of filters will reduce the dataset by ~1% (in which case following the original vector index is fine) or by 99.99% (in which case you just want to brute force the remaining vectors).Tried a million different things, but haven't heard of Turbopuffer yet. Any references on how they perform with such additional filters?reply",
      "Lucene and ES implement a shortcut for filters that are restrictive enough. Since it's already optimized for figuring out if something falls into your filter set, you first determine the size of that. You traverse the HNSW normally, then if you have traversed more nodes than your filter set's cardinality, you just switch to brute forcing your filter set distance comparisons. So worst case scenario is you do 2x your filter set size vector distance operations. Quite neat.reply",
      "Oh that's nice! Any references on this shortcut? How do you activate that behavior? I was playing around with ES, but the only suggestion I found was to use `count` on filters before deciding (manually) which path to take.reply",
      "Here you go https://github.com/apache/lucene/pull/656 - no need to do anything from the user side to trigger it as far as I know.reply",
      "Hybrid search with vector similarity and filtering I think has mostly been solved by Vespa and not even recently.https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-hybrid-billion-scale-vector-sear...reply",
      "Not really. The thing Vespa solved was taking existing ANN methods and fixing a disk/RAM tradeoff (and some other niceties). That's nowhere close to adequte when:1. As softwaredoug mentioned, you might want to filter results, potentially with a high filtration rate.2. ANN isn't good enough. Suppose you need bounded accuracy with meaningfully sublinear time on a high-dimensional dataset. You're hosed.Point (1) is just a repeat of a general observation that composition of nice data structures doesn't usually give you a nice data structure, even if it technially works. Creating a thing that does what you want without costing both arms and the president's leg requires actually understanding DS&A and applying it in your solution from the ground up.Point (2) might seem irrelevant (after all, people are \"building\" stuff with RAG and whatnot nowadays aren't they?), but it's crucial to a lot of applications. Imagine, e.g., that there exists one correct result in your database. The guarantees provided by SOTA ANN solutions (on high-dimensional data) have a steep compute/correctness tradeoff, giving you an abysmal chance of finding your document without searching an eye-watering fraction of your database. I usually work around that with the relaxation that the result needs to be the best one but that its information can be fuzzy (admitting solutions which merge a bunch of low-dimensional queries, corrected via some symmetry in a later step), but if you actually need good KNN results then you're kind of hosed.reply",

So, stop, and listen to me \u2026 \u201dI agree with the headline here. If Google can pay someone to find bugs, they can pay someone to fix them.

      "I've been a proponent of upstreaming fixes for open source software.Why?  \n - It makes continued downstream consumption easier, you don't have to rely on fragile secret patches.  \n - It gives back to projects that helped you to begin with, it's a simple form of paying it forward.  \n - It all around seems like the \"ethical\" and \"correct\" thing to do.Unfortunately, in my experience, there's often a lot of barriers within companies to upstream.  Reasons can be everything from compliance, processes, you name it... It's unfortunate.I have a very distinct recollection of talks about hardware aspirations and upstreaming software fixes at a large company.  The cultural response was jarring.reply",
      "As yet, Valve is the only company I know of doing this, and it's paying off in dividends both for Linux and for Valve.

      "> Valve is the only company I know of [upstreaming fixes for open source software]Sorry, that's ridiculous.  Basically every major free software dependency of every major platform or application is maintained by people on the payroll of one or another tech giant (edit: or an entity like LF or Linaro funded by the giants, or in a smaller handful of cases a foundation like the FSF with reasonably deep industry funding).  Some are better than others, sure.  Most should probably be doing more.  FFMpeg in particular is a project that hasn't had a lot of love from platform vendors (most of whom really don't care about software codecs or legacy formats anymore), and that's surely a sore point.But to pretend that SteamOS is the only project working with upstreams is just laughable.reply",

      "I've literally had my employer's attorneys tell me I can't upstream patches because it would put my employer's name on the project, and they don't want the liability.No, it didn't help giving them copies of licenses that have the usual liability clauses.It seems a lot of corporate lawyers fundamentally misunderstand open source.reply",
      "Corporate counsel will usually say no to anything unusual because there's no personal upside for them to say yes.

      "The digipot is vaguely similar to how a R2R ladder DAC works. There are two resistor values used: R and 2R. The \"interesting part\" of the circuit has bits x 2R resistors in parallel. One end of each resistor (let's call it input) is connected directly to the digital bit from the PWM sample.Then there is the series bits x R resistors. The output of each 2R resistor is connected in-between the two resistors that straddle its bit position. So:    Out\n    |\n    R\n    +-2R-bit0 \n    R\n    +-2R-bit1\n    ... \n    R\n    +-2R-bitN\n\nAnd that's it (apart from pull-up/down resistors)! Due to the way that resistors in series and parallel work, each input step in the ladder provides twice the voltage of the previous if powered: it's base 2 enshrined in a physical object.These are relatively uncommon because they are highly sensitive to the resistor (and trace) tolerance, but this circuit is my Euler's identity of electronics: it very literally bridges the digital and analog worlds.reply",

      "Any similar benchmarks for MacOS?I daily drive a couple Macs and enjoy them but I can't help but notice they seem slower in the terminal than the alternatives. Can't get any kind of discussion on /r/mac as it's just 'Apple silicon is fast!'reply",
      "You can run the tests yourself, he describes them in the blog. Used the Is It Snappy! app to measure frames.I tried the throughput test myself just now between the native macOS terminal and ghostty.Ghostty:\ncat /tmp/lines.txt  0.00s user 0.02s system 36% cpu 0.069 totalNative mac terminal:\ncat /tmp/lines.txt  0.00s user 0.02s system 18% cpu 0.115 totalSeems much faster than any of the OP's windows terminals tested except for MinTTY.Likewise in one unscientific test with Is It Snappy, ghostty took 8 frames to render the output from pressing the key, but I didn't repeat multiple times.So, seems faster, but I know what you are talking about, I experience it too. Something about using the terminal on macOS feels sluggish compared to alternatives. It's especially noticeable for me over SSHreply",

      "Is there not a suitable CLI or TUI client for Windows that can simply be called from within Windows Terminal? Honest question. I just know that on Linux, it'd be really weird to ask for my terminal emulator to embed a serial client rather than call e.g. screen or minicom from my shell.reply"

It\u2019s now competitive with WSLtty on my\nmachine. Details in the GitHub\nIssue.In 2009, I wrote about why MinTTY is the best terminal on\nWindows.\nEven today, that post is one of my most popular.Since then, the terminal situation on Windows has improved:The beginning of a year is a great time to look at your tools and\nimprove your environment.I\u2019d already enabled 24-bit color in all of my\nenvironments\nand streamlined my tmux\nconfig. It\u2019s about time\nthat I take a look at the newer terminals.Roughly in order, I care about:I considered the following.Testing color and italics support is easy with my\ncolortest.rs\nscript. To test basic emoji, you can cat the Unicode emoji 1.0\nemoji-data.txt.\nTo test more advanced support, try the zero-width joiner list in the\nlatest/ directory.Everything but conhost.exe meets my bar.It\u2019s also worth noting that conhost.exe has a terrible default\npale"
