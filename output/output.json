      "> Most of those hot fixes are data driven as in database updates.

This can be observed with the release of every single new raid on live streams as Blizzard employees are watching the world first attempts and tweaking/tuning the fights as they happen.EDIT: Here's such an example, for the majority of the fight the extra tank could keep a spawned monster away from the boss, then mid-fight, the monster suddenly started one-shotting the tank, without the disruption of the instance, this was Blizzard's way of addressing a cheese strat to force the players to do the right as designed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gMm60BXAjU\n \nreply",

      "This reminds me of a fun experience I had in grad school.  I was working on writing some fast code to compute something I can no longer explain, to help my advisor in his computational approach to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.  I gave a talk at a number theory seminar a few towns over, and was asked if I was doing this in hopes of reinforcing the evidence behind the conjecture.  I said with a grin, \"well, no, I'd much rather find a counterexample.\"  The crowd went wild; I've never made a group of experts so angry as that day.Well, I never was much of a number theorist.  I never did come to understand the basic definitions behind the BSD conjecture.  Number theory is so old, so deep, that writing a PhD on the topic is the step one takes to become a novice.  Where I say that I didn't understand the definitions, I certainly knew them and understood the notation.  But there's a depth of intuition that I never arrived at.  So the uproar of experts, angry that I had the audacity to hope for a counterexample, left me more curious than shaken: what do they see, that they cannot yet put words to?I am delighted by these advances in formalism.  It makes the field feel infinitely more approachable, as I was a programmer long before I called myself a mathematician, and programming is still my \"native tongue.\"  To the engineers despairing at this story, take it from me: this article shows that our anxiety at the perceived lack of formalism is justified, but we must remember that anxiety is a feeling -- and the proper response to that feeling is curiosity, not avoidance.\n \nreply",
      "> The crowd went wild; I've never made a group of experts so angry as...Also not a number theorist...but I'd bet those so-called experts had invested far, far too many of their man-years in that unproven conjecture.  All of which effort and edifice would collapse into the dumpster if some snot-nosed little upstart like you, using crude computation, achieved overnight fame by finding a counter-example.(If I could give my many-decades-ago younger self some advice for math grad school, one bit of that would be:  For any non-trivial \"Prove X\" assignment, start by spending at least 1/4 of my time budget looking for counter-examples.  For academic assignments, that's 99% likely to fail.  But the insight you'll get into the problem by trying will be more worth it.  And the other 1% of the time you'll look like a genius.  And - as soon as you attempt real math research, those odds shift enormously, in favor of the counterexample-first approach.)\n \nreply",
      "> All of which effort and edifice would collapse into the dumpster if some snot-nosed little upstart like you, using crude computation, achieved overnight fame by finding a counter-example.Not at all.  In fact, if I had found a counterexample, it would cause a flurry of new research to quantify exactly how wrong the BSD conjecture is.  Such a finding would actually be a boon to their career!  That's why my response is curiosity, and not to sneer at them for protecting their extremely secure tenured careers.Edit 1: And if you think you've found a counterexample to a long-standing conjecture with a computation, you'd better be damned sure that your computation is correct before opening your mouth in public.  And that takes a ton of work in the case of the BSD conjecture, because you've almost certainly identified a bug in the extremely complex code underlying that computation.  If I ever thought I was holding onto such a counterexample, I'd approach a human calculator like Ralph Greenberg as my first step (after internal checks: re-running the code on another computer to rule out cosmic bit flips, and perhaps running more naive, unoptimized implementations).Edit 2: This attitude pervades my software development career, and I've brought it to my foray into superconducting circuit design: a bug report brings joy to my life, and I aim to shower the reporter with praise (which may involve chocolate).  There is nothing more satisfying than being proven wrong, because it helps us collectively move toward greater truths.\n \nreply",
      "> my foray into superconducting circuit designCurious, what do you work on? (I also research superconductivity.)\n \nreply",
      "I've got a brief bio in my profile.  The major thrust of my role is to develop architectures of digital/analog circuits for quantum computers, and I've lately been getting into device design.  That's miles away from superconductivity research (at most, I could say I'm in applied superconductivity), so allow me to fawn a little... I'd love to be doing that kind of work!\n \nreply",
      "To put a little color on the BSD conjecture, it states that the rank (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) of rational points on an elliptic curve is related to the residue (coefficient of 1/q) of the L-function for the curve. There are some additional multiplicative factors, in particular the size of the Tate-Shafarevich group.No one knows how to compute the size of that group in general (in fact no one has proved that it's finite!). Computing the rank of a curve via non-analytic means is more akin to a bespoke proof than a straightforward computation (see Noam Elkies' work).So saying you're going to disprove BSD with blind computation is rather naive unless you're sitting on several career-defining proofs and not sharing them.\n \nreply",
      "If the BSD rank conjecture were false, then the simplest counterexample might be an elliptic curve with algebraic rank 4 and analytic rank 2.  This could be established for a specific curve by rigorously numerically computing the second derivative of the L-series at 1 to some number of digits and getting something nonzero (which is possible because elliptic curves are modular - see work of Dikchitser).  This is a straightforward thing to do computations about and there are large tables of rank 4 curves.  This is also exactly the problem I suggested to the OP in grad school. :-)In number theory doing these sorts of \u201cobvious computational investigations\u201d is well worth doing and led to many of the papers I have written.  I remember doing one in grad school and being shocked when we found a really interesting example in minutes, which led to a paper.\n \nreply",
      "Then again it might just be a misunderstanding. And the so-called experts, in aggregate, turn out to be right more often than not.Say I show up to a physics conference and proclaim that I hope my computational effort will disprove some major physical law. Well, you better have a good delivery, or the joke might not land well!Sometimes people take things a little too literally after attending hours of very dry talks at serious seminars. I wouldn't read too much into it.\n \nreply",
      "> All of which effort and edifice would collapse into the dumpsterExcept it wouldn't, because the work towards the BSD would still be right and applicable to other problems. If someone proved the Riemann hypothesis false, all of our math (and there is a lot of it) surrounding the problem isn't immediately made worthless. The same is true for any mathematical conjecture.I don't doubt the rest of your comment might have played a role, however.\n \nreply",
      "> Also not a number theorist...but I'd bet those so-called experts had invested far, far too many of their man-years in that unproven conjecture. All of which effort and edifice would collapse into the dumpster if some snot-nosed little upstart like you, using crude computation, achieved overnight fame by finding a counter-example.Are you maybe confusing math academia for psychology or social sciences? There is no replication crisis in math, no house of cards of self-proclaimed experts riding on bullshit. Mathematicians are _actually experts_ at a deep and extremely rigorous technical field -- many of them are even experts at computational approaches to problems! -- and when outsiders and upstarts resolve old conjectures, mathematicians generally react by celebrating them and showering them with fame, job offers and gushing articles in Quanta.\n \nreply"

      "I've used both, though I'm not sure I can compare them directly, since it has been a year or more since I switched from Hacker's Keyboard.Unexpected Keyboard works well for me when using Termux, possibly even better than Hacker's Keyboard, since I find it easier to swipe on a key to get to uncommonly-used symbols rather than switching to a different keyboard layer. Every now and then I accidentally swipe a key when I meant to press it, and end up entering a accented character when I didn't mean to, but this is fairly rare. I don't use Termux very often, but for occasional vim or terminal usage it's totally sufficient.One cool feature of Unexpected Keyboard (which may be available elsewhere, I haven't looked at many others) is that you can swipe left and right on the space bar to quickly and accurately scroll left and right in a text field.

Why put a giant target on your back like that, when you'd still be paid incredibly handsomely to be SVP or whatever but be 10 times more anonymous?

      "Basically, Li-Air elements are wasting the energy from the phase change of oxygen. When a Li-Ion battery is discharged, you get the gaseous oxygen and bind it into a solid state molecule.To do that, you need to expend roughly the same amount of energy that is needed to first liquify and then solidify the oxygen.In fancy chemistry-speak it's called \"entropic loss\". You do gain some of that energy back when the battery is charged, as oxygen goes from a well-ordered solid state into the gaseous state. But it's not 100%.\n \nreply",
      "Is there a similar volumetric equivalent measurement or is it all about energy density by weight? Like, if the batteries are lightweight but massive, that would also be a bit of a problem since the structure to safely transport a large volume could be expensive and heavy.\n \nreply",
      "Looks like the created cell is 614 Wh/L from the above comment. Gasoline is ~2.2kWh/L [0]. So my take is that even with the created cell the density is not going to be an issue with car or grid batteries -- only <4 times the size even at this non-theoretical cell. Who knows how the packs will be configured though as I am sure airflow will be a design consideration when making larger packs.[0] This uses the 3kWh/kg that was provided above and a density of gasoline of .75g/mL    units\n    You have: 0.7429 g/mL * 3 kWh/kg\n    You want: kWh/L\n * 2.2287\n \nreply"

She passed, he called his doctor and less than a week later he was also dead. He got a chance to visit his family, apparently drive around his hobby farm one more time and then that was it. He didn't want to deal with being alone and seriously ill.Another friend was in renal and congestive heart failure and possibly could have lived longer but they were driving 100km daily to get to the nearest dialysis clinic and again, this person was definitely dying.

I assume it's the same headspace as flat earthers, it doesn't effect me so why should I care about aligning my thoughts with the real world, let me invent theoretical overlords and victims and argue about this new synthetic world that exists in my imagination.I just can't be uncharitable enough to believe a person who has seen it first hand, that a person would embrace such unfettered cruelty as to deny a person living in constant hell a drop of water.That being said... fuck, back in 2000 I did meet a bunch of people that denied hiv existed and said even if it did it was a punishment on gay people and it would be better if it wasn't cured so they would be scared and \"behave\" (yes, I personally met these people, the non-existence was rare but the \"shouldn't develop treatment\" was not a minority view in the city I lived in at the time.)After my mother died, for a while I volunteered with \"No one dies alone.\", I doubt a single person who has done so for any length of time is going to argue \"slippery slope\".\n \nreply",
      "Sorry for your loss. I don't know if he got to explain to you (all) the reasons behind his choice.My fear is that I will be 70-80-90, I won't be able to serve myself even for the very basics, I will have lost my memory, and will be a total burden (all the pain - zero joy) to my close family. Why would I do this to them? Perhaps he had a motivation like this - to make sure he won't hurt your lives, your relationships, etc.Either way, it is a very difficult choice..\n \nreply",
      "To be honest, my grand parents both died in their nineties and their last two years were really sad. It was not so much the physical decline but the mental one. At the end, while technically alive, so little of who they were as persons remained, they might as well have been dead.I fully understand someone in their 80s knowing the end is near choosing to leave on their own term.\n \nreply",
      "My bio father (he was not a part of my life, which is important to note when you get to the end of this comment) lived to 89, for certain values of \"lived\". He had long ago exhausted his ability to support himself financially, he was blind, deaf, unable to get around town on his own, had substantial age-related mental health issues, as well as a litany of small but significant health issues. I cannot speak for him, but I'd like to think that if I came anywhere close to that existence and I had the option available, I would opt for an end on my terms that respected my dignity and that of my family. As an American, however, I expect to die like he did: poor, mostly alone, and in pain.\n \nreply",
      ">\"I would opt for an end on my terms that respected my dignity and that of my family.

No 3rd parties needed assuming that person is still mentally and physically adequate enough.\n \nreply",
      "I appreciate you sharing your perspective. I wondered, when you described feeling \"really sad\" and the sense that people \"might as well have been dead,\" I'm wondering if you're speaking about your own emotional response or trying to convey how the individuals themselves felt about their situation?Edited to sound less harsh\n \nreply",
      "Well, they experienced extended physical suffering and having the mental acuity of a toddler. Feel free to try to convince me that not being able to recognise your own kids and the person you have been married with for seventy years while gradually fully losing your hearing and sight and not being able to leave a bed is somehow a worthy experience. I personally question if you can even talk of experiencing anything because that would imply there is something left which can meaningfully process experiences. And that\u2019s the part which came after  the initial decline when they were just insanely mean to their loved ones all the time.You do sound harsh by the way.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "Medically-assisted dying \u2013 also known as voluntary euthanasia \u2013 accounted for 4.7% of deaths in Canada in 2023, new government data shows.The country's fifth annual report since euthanasia was legalised in 2016 showed around 15,300 people underwent assisted dying last year after being successful in their applications.The median age of this group was more than 77. The vast majority \u2013 around 96% - had a death deemed \"reasonably foreseeable\", due to severe medical conditions such as cancer.In the small minority of other cases, patients may not have been terminally ill, but sought an assisted death due to a long and complicated illness that had significantly impacted their quality of life.Canada is among a few countries that have introduced assisted dying laws in the past decade. Others include Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria.In Canada, consenting adults can request medical assistance in dying from a healthcare provider if they have a serious and irremediable medical condition.So"
