      "> Meanwhile, Canada is in the final stages of considering legislation that would fix the Canadian version of the DMCA, a bill called C-244 that is in its third reading in the Senate and expected to move before the end of the month. If Canada legalized circumventing technological protection measures for the purposes of repair, we might just have to head north to find the tools we need to do repairs.That's good news, I didn't know about that bill. It looks like it was voted for unanimously in parliament. It's nice when you hear about our government doing something good for once.\n \nreply",

      "> After long deliberation and co-design sessions we have concluded that defining training data as a benefit, not a requirement, is the best way to goHuh, then this will be a useful definition.The FSF position is untenable. Sure, it\u2019s philosophically pure. But given a choice between a practical definition and a pedantically-correct but useless one, people will use the former. Irrespective of what some organisation claims.> would have been better, he said, if the OSI had not tried to \"bend and reshape a decades old definition\" and instead had tried to craft something from a clean slateNot how language works.\n \nreply",
      "What I find frustrating is that this isn't just about pedantry - you can't meaningfully audit an \"open-source\" model for security or reliability problems if you don't know what's in the training data. I believe that should be the \"know it when I see it\" test for open-source: has enough information been released for a competent programmer (or team) to understand the how the software actually works?I understand the analogy to other types of critical data often not included in open-source distros (e.g Quake III's source is GPL but its resources like textures are not, as mentioned in the article). The distinction is in these cases the data does not clarify anything about the functioning of the engine, nor does its absence obscure anything. So by my earlier smell test it makes sense to say Quake III is open source.But open-sourcing a transformer ANN without the training data tells us almost nothing about the internal functioning of the software. The exact same source code might be a medical diagnosis machine, or a simple translator. It does not pass my smell test to say this counts as \"open source.\" It makes more sense to say that ANNs are data-as-code programming paradigms, glued together by a bit of Python. An analogy would be if id released its build scripts and announced Quake III was open-source, but claimed the .cpp and .h files were proprietary data. The batch scripts tell you a lot of useful info - maybe even that Q3 has a client-server architecture - but they don't tell you that the game is an FPS, let alone the tricks and foibles in its renderer.\n \nreply",

      "> Maybe the supporter of the definition could demonstrate practically modifying a ML model without using the original training data, and show that it is just as easy as with the original data and it does not limit what you can do with it (e.g. demonstrate it can unlearn any parts of the original data as if they were not used).I quite like that comment that was left on the article. I know some models you can tweak the weights, without the source data, but it does seem like you are more restricted without the actual dataset.Personally, the data seems to be part of the source to me, in this case. I mean, the code is derived from the data itself, the weights are the artifact of training. If anything, they should provide the data, the training methodology, the model architecture, the code to train and infer, and the weights could be optional. I mean, the weights basically are equivalent to a built artifact, like the compiled software.And that means commercially, people would pay for the cost of training. I might not have the resources to \"compile\" it myself, aka, run the training, so maybe I pay a subscription to a service that did.\n \nreply",

      "I've gone down a bit of a rabbit hole on path finding in the last week or two (most recently, this isn't the first time). When you have some knowledge of the topology of the graph you can use different techniques to do better than djikstra's.Of course, if you have lots of time and space and a completely static graph, you can run all pairs shortest paths and simply store all the results for O(1) path lookup, but there are intermediates for varying types of graphs. This stack exchange article is a good overview: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/11855/how-do-th....I've been wondering about how well D* lite would perform in practice with a somewhat varying graph. I read some suggestions that if the graph is changing even a bit on occasion, then it will mostly degrade to A*, since many changed paths would need to be re-evaluated.In the context of games, I've also been thinking about a technique called true distance heurustics (TDH), where you essentially precompute the distances between some fixed set of nodes, and then use those as a part of the heurustic for A* (or D* lite in this case), but it seems like updating these TDH in the case of a changing graph might introduce just as much overhead as not having them in the first place. It might be an interesting trade off though, if you have some \"lines\" (e.g., think train lines) that are much faster than roadways, you could handle each of these specially via the TDH, and in exchange you would be able to assume a lower \"max speed\" for use with the A* heurustic, allowing you to explore fewer paths (since with a lower \"max speed\" paths will more rapidly increase in cost), whereas if you had to assume all car based paths could move as fast as a train, you would have to explore more paths.\n \nreply",

      "No, I don't believe so.It clarifies specifically what problem it is optimal for \"We prove that our working-set property is sufficient to guarantee universal optimality, specifically, for the problem of ordering vertices by their distance from the source vertex\", but A* only explores a subset of vertices based on the heuristic, so it can be more efficient.\n \nreply",

From what I've seen, token logprobs are correlated enough with correctness of the answer to serve as a useful signal at scale, but it's a weak enough correlation that it probably isn't great for evaluating any single output.My best guess is that somewhere close to the root of the problem is that language models still don't really distinguish syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationships. The examples in this article are a little bit forced in that respect because the alternatives it shows in the illustrations are all paradigmatic alternatives but roughly equivalent from a syntax perspective.This might relate to why, within a given GPT model generation, the earlier versions with more parameters tend to be more prone to hallucination than the newer, smaller, more distilled ones. At least for the old non-context-aware language models (the last time I really spent any serious time digging deep into language models), it was definitely the case that models with more parameters would tend to latch onto syntagmatic information so firmly that it could kind of \"overwhelm\" the fidelity of representation of semantics.

      "The correct way to think about the problem is in terms of evaluating joins (or any other queries) over changing datasets.  And for that you need an engine designed for *incremental* processing from the ground up: algorithms, data structures, the storage layer, and of course the underlying theory.  If you don't have such an engine, you're doomed to build layer of hacks, and still fail to do it well.We've been building such an engine at Feldera (https://www.feldera.com/), and it can compute joins, aggregates, window queries, and much more fully incrementally.  All you have to do is write your queries in SQL, attach your data sources (stream or batch), and watch results get incrementally updated in real-time.\n \nreply",
      "Hi, I\u2019ve read the DBSP paper and it\u2019s a really well-thought out framework; all the magic seemed so simple with the way the paper laid things out. However, the paper dealt with abelian Z-sets only, and mentioned that in your implementation, you also handle the non-abelian aspect of ordering. I was wondering if you guys have published about how did you that?\n \nreply",
      "Is it related to Differential Dataflow / timely dataflow https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow\n \nreply",
      "We have our own formal model called DBSP: https://docs.feldera.com/papersIt is indeed inspired by timely/differential, but is not exactly comparable to it. One nice property of DBSP is that the theory is very modular and allows adding new incremental operators with strong correctness guarantees, kind of LEGO brick for incremental computation. For example we have a fully incremental implementation of rolling aggregates (https://www.feldera.com/blog/rolling-aggregates), which I don't think any other system can do today.\n \nreply",
      "Are you aware of any efforts to apply DBSP's theory to a general programming language/environment? From my perspective, DDlog was the most inspiring project in the field of incremental computation, but it seems like all of these projects just lead to implementations of streaming databases or other similar commercial products that fit into Data\u2122 pipelines (no offense). Incremental computation pops up everywhere, from databases to business logic to UI rendering and video game graphics, and I have this hunch that if the problem could be solved at a fundamental level and in an accessible way, we could have revolutionary gains for programmers and programs.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for the kind words about DDlog :)The reason DBSP and Differential Dataflow work so well is because they are specialized to relational computations. Relational operators have nice properties that allow evaluating them incrementally.  Incremental evaluation for a general purpose language like Rust is a much, much harder problem.FWIW, DBSP is available as a Rust crate (https://crates.io/crates/dbsp), so you can use it as an embedded incremental compute engine inside your program.\n \nreply",
      "Can someone explain what the use case is for streaming joins in the first place?I've written my fair share of joins in SQL. They're indispensable.But I've never come across a situation where I needed to join data from two streams in real time as they're both coming in. I'm not sure I even understand what that's supposed to mean conceptually.It's easy enough to dump streams into a database and query the database but clearly this isn't about that.So what's the use case for joins on raw stream data?\n \nreply",
      "Event correlations are a typical one. Think about ad tech: you want every click event to be hydrated with information about the impression or query that led to it. Both of those are high-volume log streams.You want to end up with the results of:```\nselect * from clicks left join impressions on (clicks.impression_id=impressions.id)\n```but you want to see incremental results - for instance, because you want to feed the joined rows into a streaming aggregator to keep counts as up to date as possible.\n \nreply",
      "That's helpful, thanks.I was definitely under the impression that ad impressions and clicks would be written to databases immediately and queried from there.I'm still having a hard time imagining in what case you'd need a \"live\" aggregating display that needed to join data from multiple streams, rather than just accumulating from individual streams, but I guess I can imagine that there are circumstances where that would be desired.Thanks!\n \nreply",
      "Live-updated aggregates are quite common in this area. Consider metered billing (\"discontinue this ad after it has been served/clicked/rendered X times\"), reactive segmentation (\"the owner of a store has decided to offer a discount to anyone that viewed but did not purchase products X, Y, and Z within a 10 minute period\"), or intrusion detection (\"if the same sequence of routes is accessed quickly in rapid succession across the webserver fleet, regardless of source IP or UA, send an alert\").In a very large number of cases, those streams of data are too large to query effectively (read: cheaply or with low enough latency to satisfy people interested in up-to-date results) at rest. With 100ks or millions of events/second, the \"store then query\" approach loses fidelity and affordability fast.\n \nreply"

The maintainers highlighted the problems and the author came back basically with \"I don't believe you so let's go with my approach to stay more general\" - it's one thing to disagree, it's another to straight up not acknowledge the feedback. The author ate a lot of very senior people's time arguing instead of listening to them and learning from their experience and that was justifiably frustrating forcing much more direct feedback. The kind of mistake the author made - having to enforce at each individual syscall level instead of it being a protection on the memory itself enforced on all accesses - indicates a poor understanding of how to think about security and build security APIs which is a problem when you're proposing a security API.It's particularly impressive how misguided the patch is given that they took inspiration from the OpenBSD API implementation, changed both API & implementation, & then argued with both Linus and Theo who started Linux & OpenBSD respectively and were trying to give direct feedback about how OpenBSD is different and why it took the approach it did.Hopefully the author has taken the more forceful feedback as a learning opportunity about listening to feedback when the people giving it to you have a lot more experience. Or their team is coaching them about what went wrong now that this became so visible to learn what they got wrong.From Matthew Wilcox who is another senior Linux maintainer:>  I concur with Theo & Linus.  You don't know what you're doing.  I think the underlying idea of mimmutable() is good, but how you've split it up and how you've implemented it is terrible.It's delivered directly and bluntly but it's not mean or personal.

This would go a long way to unifying zram and zswap in the future.- TuxOnIce being permablocked by some heels-in-sand maintainers until the kernel diverged to much and the patch writer gave up. This one would have fixed hibernation on Linux.. in other words, hibernation still sucks because of these maintainers.- Of course the trench warfare all the C-proficient maintainers are waging to chase all the Rust-in-Linux people away, lest they have to learn Rust. ~80% of CVEs are memory-related, so you could say that in say.. 10 years time, ~80% of the CVEs happening in the Linux kernel are the legacy of Ted & co.\n \nreply",
      "You can roughly be:1. Wrong and ignorant2. Wrong and knowledgeable3. Right and ignorant4. Right and knowledgeableThere's also when there's just a disagreement of opinion because you weight the tradeoffs differently, in which case there's less of a right or wrong.The main difference is that in those cases the people involved were in camps 2-4 or simply weighted tradeoffs differently. In this case the author seemed much more clearly in camp 1.Regarding the claim that \"this one would have fixed hibernation on Linux\" - maybe, but it's hard to evaluate a road not taken. It could have made other tradeoffs or caused other issues down the road that aren't visible to you right now because it didn't get mainlined or maybe hibernation would still have been broken. Or maybe it would have been hunky dorry. But it kind of doesn't matter because the author in this case was clearly wrong (i.e. the patch wouldn't have achieved the goal it set out to do and would have predictably caused vulnerabilities to become possible in the future as the kernel evolved).As for Rust-in-Linux, it sounds like your not actually up to date [1]. I'll forgive Ted's emotional volatility at the infamous filesystem talk as he's been much more calm about it now:> There is a need for documentation and tutorials on how to write filesystem code in idiomatic Rust. He said that he has a lot to learn; he is willing to do that, but needs help on what to learn.I'd say \"trench resistance\" not warfare.

    "first_paragraph": "By Alan CaoIf you love exploit mitigations, you may have heard of a new system call named mseal landing into the Linux kernel\u2019s 6.10 release, providing a protection called \u201cmemory sealing.\u201d Beyond notes from the authors, very little information about this mitigation exists. In this blog post, we\u2019ll explain what this syscall is, including how it\u2019s different from prior memory protection schemes and how it works in the kernel to protect virtual memory. We\u2019ll also describe the particular exploit scenarios that mseal helps stop in Linux userspace, such as stopping malicious permissions tampering and preventing memory unmapping attacks.Memory sealing allows developers to make memory regions immutable from illicit modifications during program runtime. When a virtual memory address (VMA) range is sealed, an attacker with a code execution primitive cannot perform subsequent virtual memory operations to change the VMA\u2019s permissions or modify how it is laid out for their benefit.If you\u2019re like me"

Joshua Mo at Shuttle did a comparison between Diesel and SeaORM in January of this year that was really interesting [3].[1]: https://diesel.rs/[2]: https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/[3]: https://www.shuttle.dev/blog/2024/01/16/best-orm-rust\n \nreply",
      "My first reaction is this feels like a nice middleground between Diesel and SeaORM.The codegen part makes all columns and tables and stuff checked at compile-time (name and type) like Diesel, with a query builder that's more natural like SeaORM. I hope the query builder does not end up too magical like SQLAlchemy with its load of footguns, and stay close in spirit to Diesel that's \"write sql in rust syntax\".I think time will tell, and for now I'm keeping my Diesel in production :D\n \nreply",
      "Sea ORM is too opinionated in my experience. Even making migration is not trivial with their own DSL.  \nDiesel was ok, but I never use it anymore since rocket moved to async.I'm mainly use sqlx, it's simple to use, there's query! and query_as! macro which is good enough for most of the case.\n \nreply",
      "I like sqlx, but have been eyeing diesel for some time. Any reasons you don't use diesel_async?\n \nreply",
      "It's nice seeing more Django/Prisma style ORMs where the non-SQL source code is the source of truth for the schema and migrations are automatically generated.\n \nreply",
      "Looks well thought out i like that for the most part this seems faster/easier than rolling your own sql query mapping etc compared to the other solutions I've come across in rust\n \nreply",
      "Toasty was the focus of Carl Lerche's P99 CONF keynote on Wednesday. It provoked some interesting discussion in the chat.\n \nreply",
      "For me diesel hits right balance since it is more a query builder and it is close to the SQL syntax. But sometimes it doesn't work because it is very strongly typed, right now I use sea-query for those scenarios and I built the bridge between the two.Ideally I would use something akin to Go Jet.\n \nreply",
      "Looks awesome. Would love to see the table definitions that are generated from the schema as well.\n \nreply",
      "I don't get the pent up anger with ORMs, I used it for my SaaS on Flask that I run and own for 4 years bringing in over $2M+ ARR with no issues.Great to see some development in this for Rust, perhaps after it becomes stable I may even switch my SaaS to it.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "202420232022October 23, 2024Toasty is an asynchronous ORM for the Rust\nprogramming language that prioritizes ease of use. Toasty supports SQL and NoSQL\ndatabases, including DynamoDB and Cassandra (soon).Toasty is currently in the early stages of development and should be considered\na \"preview\" (not ready for real-world usage yet). It also isn't released on\ncrates.io yet. I am announcing it now as I have made the Github repository open,\nwill continue development in the open, and am hoping to get feedback.Projects that use Toasty start by creating a schema file to define the\napplication's data model. For example, this is the contents of the\nhello-toasty/schema.toasty\nfile.Using the Toasty CLI tool, you will generate all necessary Rust code for working\nwith this data model. The generated code for the above schema is\nhere.Then, you can easily work with the data model:Historically, Rust has been positioned as a systems-level programming language.\nOn the server side, Rust has grown fastest f"
