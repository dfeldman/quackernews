      "Neither Visa nor Mastercard really implement ISO 8583 a standardized way. Which means they each issue many thousands of pages of documentation covering not only which of the standard fields they use and how, but also how they cram their proprietary data into the messages. Most card management/issuance platforms do a decent job of abstracting this away though.Transition to ISO 20022 would be a positive improvement, but I don't think it will ever meet the required ROI threshold (globally) for that to happen.\n \nreply",
      "The large card networks have so many proprietary behaviors and extensions that I really doubt whether any common standard would even make sense at this point.And if you look at how \"modern\" ISO 8583 is evolving, almost all changes and extensions are already happening in TLV-like subfields (where a new field unexpectedly appearing doesn't make existing parsers explode spectacularly), and the top-level structure is essentially irrelevant.Of course, it's a significant hurdle to newcomers to get familiar with that outer layer, but I don't get the sense that catering to these is a particular focus by either network. ISO 8583 is also a great moat (one of many in the industry, really) for existing processors, which have no buy-in to switch to a new standard and the networks need to at least somewhat keep happy.\n \nreply",

      "The type of protocol (message type, bitmap to define fields, followed by a set of fixed and variable length values) is pretty normal for the time it was developed in. Many low level things are basically packed C-structs with this type of protocol. It comes with some pitfalls on the receiver side to be careful validating dynamic field length and refusing to read past end of message or allocate an infinite buffer. But all of those are well understood by now.What I find baffling is that this \"standard\" does not specify how to encode the fields or even the message type. Pick anything, binary, ASCII, BCD, EBCDIC. That doesn't work as a standard, every implementation could send you nearly any random set of bytes with no way for the receiver to make sense of them.\n \nreply",
      "> Many low level things are basically packed C-structs with this type of protocol.Not really: C structs notably don't have variable-length fields, but ISO 8583 very much does.To add insult to injury, it does not offer a standard way to determine field lengths. This means that in order to ignore a given field, you'll need to be able to parse it (at least at the highest level)!Even ASN.1, not exactly the easiest format to deal with, is one step up from that (in a TLV structure, you can always skip unknown types by just skipping \"length\" bytes).\n \nreply",
      "A bitmap to define field presence doesn\u2019t seem so offensive, as far as serialization formats go. FlatBuffers[1] use a list of offsets instead, but that\u2019s in the context of expecting to see many identically-shaped records. One could argue that Cap\u2019n Proto with zero-packing[2] amounts to the same thing if you squint, just with the bitmap smeared all over the message.I mean, this specific thing sounds like it should have been a fatter but much more unexciting TLV affair instead. But given it\u2019s from 1987, it\u2019d probably have ended up as ASN.1 BER in that case (ETA: ah, and for extensions, it mostly did, what fun), instead of a simpler design like Protobufs or MessagePack/CBOR, so maybe the bitmaps are a blessing in disguise.[1] https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_internals.h...[2] https://capnproto.org/encoding.html#packing\n \nreply",

You can debate if the extra detail is useful or not. I also like the heart rate variability tracking with the Fenix (it seems to mirror how tire I feel pretty well). Lastly, the Fenix can hold a charge for several days. I can use it to sleep track and run and repeat and it charges quickly. If I sleep track with my Apple Watch, it may not have enough battery for the rest of the day. I run with both -- the Fenix for running specific tracking and the Apple for calling friends, listening to Audible, or podcasts.\n \nreply",

You can definitely define a primitive that would be \"take picture\", another one that is \"send to server\" and then have your own software assemble it in the way you want. Or just record and send it to the cloud / your computer.Now if it's about using a better camera that the robot would hold, you'll need to wait for the next generation that we'll reveal later next year\n \nreply"

      "It seems very odd that the article seems to be measuring the information content of specific tasks that the brain is doing or specific objects that it is perceiving. But the brain is a general-purpose computer, not a speed-card computer, or English text computer, or binary digit computer, or Rubik's cube computer.When you look at a Rubik's cube, you don't just pick out specific positions of colored squares relative to each other. You also pick up the fact that it's a Rubik's cube and not a bird or a series of binary digits or English text. If an orange cat lunged at your Rubik's cube while you were studying it, you wouldn't process it as \"face 3 has 4 red squares on the first row, then an orange diagonal with sharp claws\", you'd process it as \"fast moving sharp clawed orange cat attacking cube\". Which implies that every time you loom at the cube you also notice that it's still a cube and not any of the millions of other objects you can recognize, adding many more bits of information.Similarly, when you're typing English text, you're not just encoding information from your brain into English text, you're also deciding that this is the most relevant activity to keep doing at the moment, instead of doing math or going out for a walk. Not to mention the precise mechanical control of your muscles to achieve the requisite movements, which we're having significant trouble programming into a robot.\n \nreply",
      "My thoughts exactly. It makes no sense to me that what I'm thinking and perceiving in real-time is the equivalent of 10 bit/s of data.\n \nreply",
      "Has anyone here even read more than the title? The article literally explains that you perceive at a rate of 10^9 bits per second. But after filtering and preprocessing in the outer brain you are only left with about 10 bits per second for conscious processing for things like motor functions. Yes, you can see a Rubic's cube and perceive all sorts of facts about it and the environment at the same time. But try solving it with your hands while someone shows you a bunch of objects and asks you visual comprehension questions at the same time. You might still perceive those other objects, but consciously classifying them verbally is gonna be really difficult. It's no surprise that the feature space that your deeper brain can actively work on is quite limited.\n \nreply",
      "I did read the summary and see what you saw, but that still leads me to believe the headline of the article is clickbait and that the authors don't understand that action signalling doesn't require the same bandwidth as information processing, but even then it's way more than 10b/s.Look at a backhoe. It has a few levers and a couple pedals. EXTREMELY simple interface. Each lever and pedal is basically 1 bit for engage/disengage, but the operator has to process orders of magnitude more sensory info to operate it properly. You could use an arduino to control a backhoe, but you'd need quite a powerful computer to know what to tell the arduino to do. This shouldn't surprise anyone. Knowing how to use the tool well is always far more complicated than simply knowing how the tool operates.\n \nreply",

I mean, why not assume error correction, while we are at it, or some kind of compression algorithm that reduces the size further?If that sounds ridiculous to you, you are beginning to get it. Every single brain cell works on electric potential (a continous value). Not a single one of them can be said to be in the \"zero\" or \"one\" state (a discrete value).\n \nreply",

      "Your interpretation is correct - every single one of us was redeemed at the Cross. Essentially, Jesus came here to correct a kind of mistake.God laid down laws and then people laid down further laws and eventually all the people, even those living by the law, were guilty of having committed sin - breaking the established laws of God and that crime meant their souls would be claimed by Satan, as being people \"of the world\" - but mostly the sins we committed we were led to commit. Most of humanity was guilty of only ignorance \"Forgive them Father, for they kno not what they do\" and yet by the terms of the law, the ignorant were also guilty of sin and all souls with sin would be redeemed by the one to whom God granted authority here...So, Satan thought he won bc he beat God on a technicality, by confusing us so that even if we follow the law, we will not be saved by it, as it it not the true law. So, God choose option C and forgave all the sins - all of them, no picking and choosing and left in their place only one law, so that it couldn't easily be perverted as the previous teachings, as ALL PREVIOUS TEACHINGS had been. As Christianity has now. This act of God required his son, someone closer to him than us or angels, to die bc of sin but without cause as he had none.CS Lewis does a fine job with this mythos in the Chronicles of Narnia - the older deeper magic that has authority over all other magics.The whole thing, the crucification, was a trap set by God so that Satan would kill Jesus - to save us all from being Satan's property and it worked, we were/are saved, rn - it's already done and over.Now we just have come home and it doesn't matter how bad we are - the prodigal son speaks to those of us with such concerns.God, Jesus and anyone claiming to follow them ought to universally love everyone and anyone by default and without reason, expectations or cause - without exception and without judgement.Some we see that weak and take advantage - let them do so, help even - turn the other cheek. As Mother Theresa said so eloquently, \" Helping hurts - help anyway\" - that is our calling.To me God is like the Watsky song Sloppy Seconds - he'll take us regardless of anything we've done and he will love us as fucked up as we are at our worse amd loves us no more when we are at our best bc his love is without conditions.That is the story of the crucification and how one man, preaching universal love, executed for that at the age of 33, is still spoken of 2500 years later.We owe him for that - he expects nothing in return from us. All he wants is that we do what we know we ought to, that we not do what we kno we shouldn't or what we hate to do and to love each other as we love ourselves.That sounds like a light yoke to me - these other people speaking for him rn, they all have such a heavy yoke of rules and morals and ethics and tradition and that's all wrong.\n \nreply",

The burial ground, which contained 127 graves, was notable for its unusually high proportion of inhumation burials\u2014a practice uncommon in other Roman cemeteries in Frankfurt.

      "Dreidel history:  In England and Ireland there is a game called totum or teetotum that is especially popular at Christmastime. In English, this game is first mentioned as \u201ctotum\u201d ca. 1500-1520. [snip]\n\n  Our Eastern European game of dreidel (including the letters nun, gimmel, hey, shin) is directly based on the German equivalent of the totum game: N = Nichts = nothing; G = Ganz = all; H = Halb = half; and S = Stell ein = put in.\n\n  Thus the dreidel game represents an irony of Jewish history. In order to celebrate the holiday of Hanukkah, which celebrates our victory over cultural assimilation, we play the dreidel game, which is an excellent example of cultural assimilation!\n\nFrom \"A Different Light: The Hanukkah Book of Celebration\" - see https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-origin-of-the-d...

      "I used to think this too, but I changed my mind when a few years ago my sister wanted to play and I told her why it was a bad game because it's just based on luck, but I played anyway. She ended up getting something like 20 gimmels in a row and I got like 20 peys in a row, even after switching dreidels multiple times, and even switching where I was sitting, it was honestly one of the strangest moments of my life, it was as if god was completely rigging it against me. I think the lesson was that dreidel isn't about luck, it's about mazal.\n \nreply",
      "4.0^(20+20) = 1.2e24Assuming that, over history, a billion Jews have lived and spun a dreidel a trillion times, it's safe to reject the null hypothesis of this being random and accept the alternate hypothesis that G-d exists and He wanted you to lose.\n \nreply",
      "Yep, my s.o. wanted to play skip-bo, which is also a game so simple that it's just luck of the draw, and I lost 7 games straight after lamenting the randomness of it before we even started, which isn't as impressive of a streak as 20 but still, I understand that feeling.\n \nreply",

      "I've been playing dreidel for 40+ years.  I've never played a game to completion.  But that's not really the point of the game.  The point is it's a way to distribute chocolate while teaching a little bit about probability and game theory.We usually boxed it to about 10 minutes max.  So everyone mostly got the same amount of chocolate, and some people did a little better than others.

It's time to finish the job.You can read the last year's newsletter here but here are the high-level notes.Turns consist of spinning the dreidel.
