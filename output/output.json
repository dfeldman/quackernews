      "This is one way to look at it, but ignores the fact that most users use third party community plugins.Obsidian has a truly terrible security model for plugins. As I realized while building my own, Obsidian plugins have full, unrestricted access to all files in the vault.Obsidian could've instead opted to be more 'batteries-included', at the cost of more development effort, but instead leaves this to the community, which in turn increases the attack surface significantly.Or it could have a browser extension like manifest that declares all permissions used by the plugin, where attempting to access a permission that's not granted gets blocked.Both of these approaches would've led to more real security to end users than \"we have few third party dependencies\".reply",

The C suite sees them as a scape goat WHEN the shit hits the fan and most end users feel the same about security as they do about taking off their shoes at the airport (what is this nonsense for) and they mostly arent wrong.It's not that engineers cant take care of their own security.

It seems unlikely that, say, vertebrates are in the future going to \"undo\" the major evolutionary developments of the past and lose their skeleton, body symmetry, number of limbs, lungs, alimentary canal, nervous system, brain, etc. We see things like these developing in the evolutionary tree and mostly staying in place once created. Sure some fins turned to limbs, some gills to ears, but once things like that happened they seem to stay in place.I wonder what evolution would look like if we could see it sped up from the origin of life to billions of years into the future? A building up of complexity to begin with, but those major branches of the evolutionary tree remaining pretty stable it would seem. Continual ongoing change, but of smaller and smaller scope, perhaps - building on what came before.reply"

      "Without knowing about Jef Raskin's ideas, I implemented something really similar to one of them in one of my Mac apps, Superkey. This idea in the Canon Cat was that you hold down a key and type text that you want to select anywhere in a document, then let go to select it - typically faster than reaching for a mouse or hitting arrow keys. In the Canon Cat it was an additional key (the leap key), below the space bar.For the implementation in Superkey, you can select a key to use for this, like caps lock. The way I use it is I hold the caps lock key and type text, then the app uses OCR and optionally the macOS Accessibility API to search for matching text. Releasing the key or hitting enter will click (or double or triple click, etc) on a match.Raskin's idea was of course more text-editing focused, and tapping on the leap keys will also move the cursor. I typically use Superkey to navigate UIs quickly, kind of as though UIs all have keyboard shortcut navigation. There are also limitations that Superkey faces, like not having access to offscreen parts of a document.reply",

      "what happens if there are multiple matches in the document?reply",
      "In Superkey, all of the matches are highlighted yellow, and the selected one is highlighted green with a line to it from the text field. You can keep typing to narrow down the match, or you can navigate matches using the arrow keys (and optionally, cycle through them with the semicolon key, which is what I use). There's a screenshot at https://superkey.app.For the Canon Cat, I'm actually not sure as I've only watched videos of this functionality there.reply",
      "just downloaded Superkey and am trying ithow do I cycle using the arrow keys? currently using the arrow keys moves the cursor for the text in the search boxedit: tab seems to work. but sometimes Seek only works on one monitor (the one which has a window is selected), sometimes it finds results on bothreply",
      "Up and down arrow keys will cycle matches.At the moment the Accessibility API results are limited to the frontmost window; it's on my todo list to expand this to additional windows and displays. Also, the green line will only be drawn on results on the main display - another item I plan on fixing.reply",
      "(author) Next one in sequence. You can leap forwards or backwards. On the Cat, there is also a LOCAL LEAP for within the current document only.reply",
      "Good to know, that's what I was expecting. I'll have to give the Cat a spin! Also, thanks for this article and the Jef Raskin one - I thoroughly enjoyed them and their depth.

      "I'm huge into measurement, and quantifying this has stumped me.  It's one of the few areas I'm willing to surrender and say \"Let's just pick a % of time to put on it.\"It's bad to say \"Let's give it to folks who are underutilized or have capacity\" because those are rarely the people who can do it well.All I can come up with is the hardening % should be in proportion to how catastrophic a failure is, while keeping some faith that well done hardening ultimately pays for itself.Philip Crosby wrote about this in manufacturing as \"Quality is Free\" https://archive.org/details/qualityisfree00crosreply",
      "re: \"Nobody gets paid to do that\"There should be at least some large-company corporate incentive to measure \"Bugs vs features\"; the former is OpEx and the latter is CapEx, right?(I've been at places where Finance and IT aligned to put 3 mandatory radio-button questions in JIRA which Finance used to then approximate development expenditure as CapEx vs OpEx.

An easy way to measure this is time spent taking incidents from open -> mitigated -> resolved and treating that as time spent * engineers for amount of impact.The tricky part would be measuring time spent on hardening and making the business decision on how to quantify product features vs reliability (which I know is a false tradeoff because of time spent fixing bugs but still applies at a hand wavy level)reply",
      "Also, depending on the system, time spent on hardening is many times happening concurrently with some other tasks.Maybe you trigger a load test, or run a soaking test or whatever, while that runs you do something else, pause and check results, metrics, logs, whatever.If something is funky, you may fix something and try again, get back to your other task and so on.It's messy, and keeping track of that would add significant cognitive load for little gain.reply",

You don't optimize your software, you throw money at the problem and get more VMs from your cloud provider. You don't work on fault tolerance, you add a retry on FE. You don't carefully plan and implement security, you create a bug bounty.It sucks and I hate it.reply",

      "This is written by Kevin Bryan from University of Toronto. He has good tweets on the economics of AI, too (https://x.com/Afinetheorem).My recap of the PDF is something like:1. There are good books about the near-term economics as AI.2. There aren't many good books about \"what if the AI researchers are right\" (e.g. rapid scientific acceleration) and the economic and political impacts of those cases.3. The Second Machine Age: Digital progress boosts the bounty and widens the spread, more relative inequality. Wrong on speed (e.g. self driving tech vs regulatory change).4. Prediction Machines: AI = cheaper prediction. Which raises the value of human judgement, because that's a complement.5. Power and Prediction: Value comes when the whole system is improved not just from smaller fixes. Electrification's benefits arrived when factories reorganized, not just when they added electricity to existing layouts. Diffusion is slow because things need to be rebuilt.6. The Data Economy: Data is a nonrivalrous asset. As models get stronger and cheaper, unique private data grows in relative value.7. The Skill Code: Apprenticeship pathways may disappear. E.g. survival robots prevent juniors getting practice reps.8. Co-Intelligence: Diffusion is slowed by the jagged frontier (AI is spiky). Superhuman at one thing, subhuman at another.9. Situational Awareness: By ~2027, $1T/yr AI capex spend, big power demand, and hundreds of millions of AI researchers getting a decade of algo progress in less than a year. (Author doesn't say he agrees, but says economists should analyze what happens if it does)10. Questions: What if the AGI-pilled AI researchers are right, what will the economic and policy implications be?reply",
      "If AI researchers are wrong they're gonna have a lot of explaining to do.reply",
      "TBH its far more likely they are wrong than right.Investors are incredibly overzealous to not miss out on what happened with certain stocks of the personal computing, web 2.0 and smartphone diffusion.reply",
      "There's a certain anthropic quality to the idea that if we lived in a doomsday timeline we'd be unlikely to be here observing it.reply",

      "Quantum AI is definitely an existing research topic.Not aware of Quantum Blockchain just yet, though.reply",
