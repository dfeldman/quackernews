      "What an amazing bug. I probably spent my first 10 years on the internet just using telnet. They were wild times. You could log ethernet traffic and see passwords.

      "Telnet is used in legacy, IoT, embedded, and low-level industrial hardware. It's also intentionally enabled on devices where automation was written for telnet and it wasn't easy to switch to ssh.If you investigate most commercial uses of ssh, the security is disabled or ignored. Nobody verifies host keys, and with automation where hosts cycle, you basically have to disable verification as there's no easy way around the host keys constantly changing. Without host key verification, there's kinda no point to the rest.Even assuming the host keys were verified, the popular ssh conventions are to use either long-lived static keys (and almost nobody puts a password on theirs), or a password. Very few people use SSH with 2FA, and almost no-one uses ephemeral keys (OIDC) or certificates (which many people screw up).So in terms of how people actually use it, SSH is one of the least secure transport methods. You'd be much more secure by using telnet over an HTTPS websocket with OAuth for login.reply"

But cosmology, and frankly the entire field of astrophysics, is strikingly young.

The name \u201cBig Bang\u201d was originally a pejorative used in a similar, later fight. And so on.

      "IMO this is a symptom of the falling rate of profit, especially in the developed world. If truly productivity enhancing investment is effectively dead (or, equivalently, there is so much paper wealth chasing a withering set of profitable opportunities for investment), then capital's only game is to chase high valuations backed by future profits, which means playing the Keynesian beauty contest for keeps. This in turn means you must make ever-escalating claims of future profitability. Now, here we are in a world where multiple brand name entrepreneurs are essentially saying that they are building the last investable technology ever, and getting people to believe it because the alternative is to earn less than inflation on Procter and Gamble stock and never getting to retire.If outsiders could plausibly invest in China, some of this pressure could be dissipated for a while, but ultimately we need to order society on some basis that incentivizes dealing with practical problems instead of pushing paper around.reply",

      "I have a Ph.D. in a field of mathematics in which complex numbers are fundamental, but I have a real philosophical problem with complex numbers. In particular, they arose historically as a tool for solving polynomial equations. Is this the shadow of something natural that we just couldn't see, or just a convenience?As the \"evidence\" piles up, in further mathematics, physics, and the interactions of the two, I still never got to the point at the core where I thought complex numbers were a certain fundamental concept, or just a convenient tool for expressing and calculating a variety of things. It's more than just a coincidence, for sure, but the philosophical part of my mind is not at ease with it.I doubt anyone could make a reply to this comment that would make me feel any better about it. Indeed, I believe real numbers to be completely natural, but far greater mathematicians than I found them objectionable only a hundred years ago, and demonstrated that mathematics is rich and nuanced even when you assume that they don't exist in the form we think of them today.reply",
      "One way to sharpen the question is to stop asking whether C is \"fundamental\" and instead ask whether it is forced by mild structural constraints. From that angle, its status looks closer to inevitability than convenience.Take R as an ordered field with its usual topology and ask for a finite-dimensional, commutative, unital R-algebra that is algebraically closed and admits a compatible notion of differentiation with reasonable spectral behavior. You essentially land in C, up to isomorphism. This is not an accident, but a consequence of how algebraic closure, local analyticity, and linearization interact. Attempts to remain over R tend to externalize the complexity rather than eliminate it, for example by passing to real Jordan forms, doubling dimensions, or encoding rotations as special cases rather than generic elements.More telling is the rigidity of holomorphicity. The Cauchy-Riemann equations are not a decorative constraint; they encode the compatibility between the algebra structure and the underlying real geometry. The result is that analyticity becomes a global condition rather than a local one, with consequences like identity theorems and strong maximum principles that have no honest analogue over R.I\u2019m also skeptical of treating the reals as categorically more natural. R is already a completion, already non-algebraic, already defined via exclusion of infinitesimals. In practice, many constructions over R that are taken to be primitive become functorial or even canonical only after base change to C.So while one can certainly regard C as a technical device, it behaves like a fixed point: impose enough regularity, closure, and stability requirements, and the theory reconstructs it whether you intend to or not. That does not make it metaphysically fundamental, but it does make it mathematically hard to avoid without paying a real structural cost.reply",
      "This is the way I think. C is \"nice\" because it is constructed to satisfy so many \"nice\" structural properties simultaneously; that's what makes it special. This gives rise to \"nice\" consequences that are physically convenient across a variety of applications.I work in applied probability, so I'm forced to use many different tools depending on the application. My colleagues and I would consider ourselves lucky if what we're doing allows for an application of some properties of C, as the maths will tend to fall out so beautifully.reply",
      "Not meaning to derail an interesting conversation, but I'm curious about your description of your work as \"applied probability\". Can you say any more about what that involves?reply",
      "Absolutely, thanks for asking!Pure probability focuses on developing fundamental tools to work with random elements. It's applied in the sense that it usually draws upon techniques found in other traditionally pure mathematical areas, but is less applied than \"applied probability\", which is the development and analysis of probabilistic models, typically for real-world phenomena. It's a bit like statistics, but with more focus on the consequences of modelling assumptions rather than relying on data (although allowing for data fitting is becoming important, so I'm not sure how useful this distinction is anymore).At the moment, using probabilistic techniques to investigate the operation of stochastic optimisers and other random elements in the training and deployment of neural networks is pretty popular, and that gets funding. But business as usual is typically looking at ecological models involving the interaction of many species, epidemiological models investigating the spread of disease, social network models, climate models, telecommunication and financial models, etc. Branching processes, Markov models, stochastic differential equations, point processes, random matrices, random graph networks; these are all the common objects used. Actually figuring out their behaviour can require all kinds of assorted techniques though, you get to pull from just about anything in mathematics to \"get the job done\".reply",

      "> I doubt anyone could make a reply to this comment that would make me feel any better about it.I am also a complex number skeptic. The position I've landed on is this.1) complex numbers are probably used for far more purposes across math than they \"ought\" to be, because people don't have the toolbox to talk about geometry on R^2 but they do know C so they just use C. In particular, many of the interesting things about complex analysis are probably just the n=2 case of more general constructions that can be done by locating R inside of larger-dimensional algebras.2) The C that shows up in quantum mechanics is likely an example of this--it's a case of physics having a a circular symmetry embedded in it (the phase of the wave functions) and everyone getting attached to their favorite way of writing it. (Ish. I'm not sure how the square the fact that wave functions add in superposition. but anyway it's not going to be like \"physics NEEDS C\", but rather, physics uses C because C models the algebra of the thing physics is describing.3) C is definitely intrinsic in a certain sense: once you have polynomials in R, a natural thing to do is to add a sqrt(-1). This is not all that different conceptually from adding sqrt(2), and likely any aliens we ever run into will also have done the same thing.reply",
      "I used to feel the same way. I now consider complex numbers just as real as any other number.The key to seeing the light is not to try convincing yourself that complex number are \"real\", but to truly understand how ALL numbers are abstractions. This has indeed been a perspective that has broadened my understanding of math as a whole.Reflect on the fact that negative numbers, fractions, even zero, were once controversial and non-intuitive, the same as complex are to some now.Even the \"natural\" numbers are only abstractions: they allow us to categorize by quantity. No one ever saw \"two\", for example.Another thing to think about is the very nature of mathematical existence. In a certain perspective, no objects cannot exist in math. If you can think if an object with certain rules constraining it, voila, it exists, independent of whether a certain rule system prohibit its. All that matters is that we adhere to the rule system we have imagined into being. It does not exist in a certain mathematical axiomatic system, but then again axioms are by their very nature chosen.Now in that vein here is a deep thought: I think free will exists just because we can imagine a math object into being that is neither caused nor random. No need to know how it exists, the important thing is, assuming it exists, what are its properties?reply",
      "One nice way of seeing the inevitability of the complex numbers is to view them as a metric completion of an algebraic closure rather than a closure of a completion.Taking the algebraic closure of Q gives us algebraic numbers, which are a very natural object to consider. If we lived in an alternative timeline where analysis was never invented and we only thought about polynomials with rational coefficients, you\u2019d still end up inventing them.If you then take the metric completion of algebraic numbers, you get the complex numbers.This is sort of a surprising fact if you think about it! the usual construction of complex numbers adds in a bunch of limit points and then solutions to polynomial equations involving those limit points, which at first glance seems like it could give a different result then adding those limit points after solutions.reply",

The chat box shouldn't be the boundary.Personally, my take on standards like A2UI is that they could prove useful but the models have to easily understand them or else you have to take up additional context explaining the protocol.

      "The knowledge graph approach is cool for work contexts. For personal/social contexts I have found that a simpler memory model works surprisingly well. I built a Telegram companion bot (@adola2048_bot) that stores conversational memories as plain text summaries and retrieves them via semantic search. No graph structure, just flat memories with timestamps. It loses some relational info but the retrieval quality is good enough for natural conversation, and it is way simpler to maintain. Curious whether you considered simpler alternatives before going full graph?reply",

      "This is cool! A couple of pieces of feedback as I am looking for something in this family of things but haven't found the perfect fit:\n1. I have multiple inboxes, and want to have them work on multiple.\n2. I would really like to have skills and mcps visible and understandable. Craft Agents does a nice job of segmenting by workspace and making skills and mcps all visible so I can understand what exactly my agent is set up to do (no black boxes).\n3. I want scheduled runs. I don't need push, I actually kind of prefer just the reliability of scheduled, but push would be fine too. In particular, I want to:\na. After each granola meeting save in obsidian (I did this in Craft Code for example, but I prefer your more built in approach here, this is nice).\nb. On intervals, check my emails. I want to give it information on who/what is important to me, and ping me. E.g. billing on Anthropic failed, ping me.\nc. I also want it to email back and forth to schedule with approved categories of things on request. Just get it on my calendar (share calendly, send times, etc).\nd. I want junk etc archived.\ne. For important things, update my knowledge graph (ignore spam, etc).\n4. Tying into a to-do list that actually updates based on priorities, and suggests auto archiving things etc would be good.In practice, i connected gmail and asked it:\n\"can you archive emails that have an unsubscribe link in them (that are not currently archived)?\" and it got stuck on \"I'll check what MCP tools are available for email operations first.\" But i connected gmail through your interface, and I don't see in settings anything about it also having configured the mcp?\nI also looked at the knowledge graph and it had 20 entities, NONE of which I had any idea what they were. I'm guessing its just putting in people trying to spam me into the contacts? It didn't finish running, but I didn't want to burn endless tokens trying to see if it would find actual people i care about, so I shut it down. One \"proxy\" for \"people i care about\" might be \"people I send emails to\"? I could see how this is a hard problem. I also think regardless I want things more transparent. So for the moment, I'm sticking with Craft Code for this even though it is missing some major things but at least its more clear what it is: its claude code, with a nice UI.Hope this was helpful. I know there are multiple people working on things in this family, and I will probably be \"largely solved\" by the end of 2026, and then we will want it to do the next thing! Good luck, I will watch for updates and these are some nice ideas!reply",
      "I'm really working towards getting something similar to work. Lots of bug fixing for now. Any help is appreciated if interested.reply",
      "Really appreciate the detailed feedback. There are bunch of great features that you are pointing out that are on our roadmap (will add whats missing). The agent can setup tasks on schedule and help manage them. You can try a prompt like 'Can you schedule a background task xyz to run every morning ...'. The background tasks would show up on the UI once it is scheduled by the assistant. However, you might have to connect the necessary MCP tools in your case.On Gmail actions - we currently don\u2019t take write actions on inboxes like archiving or categorizing emails. The Google connection is read-only and used purely to build the knowledge graph. We\u2019re working on adding write actions, but we\u2019re being careful about how we implement them. Also probably why the agent was confused and was looking for an MCP to accomplish the same job.On noise in the knowledge graph \u2014 this is something we\u2019re actively tuning. We currently have different note-strictness levels that auto-inferred based on the inbox volume (configurable in ~/.rowboat/config/note-creation.json) that control what qualifies as a new node. Higher strictness prevents most emails from creating new entities and instead only updates existing ones. That said, this needs to be surfaced in the product and better calibrated. Using \u201cpeople I send emails to\u201d as a proxy for importance is a really good idea.reply",

      "Ah these poor fools. Having built this exact product (OOXML compatible editor in React) before, it took all of two minutes to find a bug. The issue is that the OOXML spec is not in fact definitive - Word is, and trying to implement it from the spec will produce something that works maybe 80% of the time then fall over completely when you hit one of hundreds of minor, undocumented edge cases. Assuming of course that CC did not just hallucinate something. And then there's the more fundamental problem that HTML/CSS has unresolvable incompatibilities with OOXML. This is why Google Docs for instance use canvas for rendering.reply",
      "Fair point, we know the editor isn't yet 1:1 with Word. When you built yours, was Word your source of truth (reverse-engineering sense), or did you stick to MS-OE376? And any recommended process for systematically uncovering those undocumented edge cases?reply",

Microsoft made OOXML available to fend off an antitrust lawsuit, there is no incentive for them to make it actually easy to build competing editors off their specification.FWIW the bug I found is that your comment parser assumes the w:date attribute represents a useful timestamp of when comments are made. It does not - a bug in Word causes it to save it as ISO8601 local time but _without timezone_, rendering it useless if more than one user across different timezone edits the document. Instead, you need to cross reference the comment with a newer comment part and find a dateUtc attribute. The above is, of course, completely undocumented.reply",

That's the system working as intended.The main crux of the problem here is that the DHS has been granted a wide berth by congress to issue administrative subpoenas - i.e. not reviewed by a real judge and not directed at criminals. In \"good\" times this made investigations run smoothly. But the reality now is that ICE is doing wide dragnets to make arrests without any judicial oversight and often hostile to habeas corpus.(Also, my understanding is that when banking is involved, it may also fall under the Banking Secrecy Act and Know Your Customer Rules - a whole other privacy nightmare.)I know we instinctively want to frame this as a privacy problem, but the real problem we need congress to act on is abolishing these \"shadow\" justice systems that agencies have been able to set up.reply",

That would hopefully result in long term reforms, but we might just be heading to civil war regardless.reply",
      ">Trying to play \"guess if the shadowy government agency is doing the right thing this week\" is a losing game.Which is why the best strategy is to bring things out of the shadows and have the government operate in the open whether that is more literal by making their actions part of the public record or just figuratively by requiring a lot of disparate parts of the government to coordinate on something like this so it can only go wrong with truly widespread corruption.Playing a cat and mouse game with the government via technology is also a losing game.  They'll always have more money, people, and expertise on their side.  When the heart of the problem is the humans involved, the solution is inherently politics.reply",
      "> So I don't think I actually have a problem with businesses handing over their customer data if there is a valid warrant or subpoena. That's the system working as intended.I disagree -- the third party doctrine that allows for governments to avoid serving/addressing warrants to the people whose data is actually being subpoenaed directly leads to things like the FISA warrant-rubber-stamp courts in the US. If the data stored on third-party servers on behalf of someone is not considered \"papers and effects\" of that person then it is entirely justified to subpoena every email stored on mail.google.com because it's just morally equivalent to a subpoena for \"all of Foomatic's business records between 2020-2025\".It seems bonkers to me that things that are essentially implementation details (such as the way that MTAs work and the lack of crypto-obfuscation in email) should allow for a legal interpretation of the 4th amendment that effectively neuters it. Letters sent via snail-mail are handled by several third parties in a very analogous way to emails but (mostly due to historical reasons, such as the fact that letters existed during the drafting of the bill of rights) we do not apply the third-party doctrine to letters.Of course, the US government has spent decades chipping away at the privacy of snail mail, so eventually we may end up in a world where snail mail and email are treated the same way (just not in a good way).reply",
