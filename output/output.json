Has anyone done something like this, perhaps even with Stalwart?

      "> binary protocolEmail was never a binary protocol. Notoriously so, it's why MIME types and MIME encodings get so complicated.Most of the \"old internet\" protocols (email, FTP, even HTTP itself) were bootstrapped on top of built-mostly-for-plaintext Telnet. HTTP as the new telnet has a bunch of improvements when it comes to binary data, request/response-based data flows, and some other considerations. HTTP/3 is even inherently a binary protocol, it's lack of \"telnet-compatibility\" one of the concerns about switching the majority of the web to it.vCard/vCal/iCard/iCal were also deeply \"plaintext formats\". JSON is an improvement because it is more structured, even more efficient, than those predecessors. JSON may not look efficient, but it compresses extremely well and can be quite efficient in gzip and Brotli streams.I feel like \"JSON over HTTP\" is a subtle improvement over \"custom text formats over telnet\", even if it doesn't sound like \"binary protocol efficiency\" at first glance. Especially as HTTP/3 pushes HTTP more efficient and more \"binary\", and arguably \"more fundamental/basic\" with HTTP/3 even taking over more roles in the TCP/UDP layer of the internet stack. (Telnet would never try to replace TCP.) HTTP isn't the worst bootstrap layer the internet could use to build new protocols and apps on top of. Sure, it would be neat to see more variety and experiments outside of the HTTP stack, too, but HTTP is too useful at this point not to build a bunch of things on top of it instead of as their own from-scratch protocol.reply"

      "I like the style of the blog but a minor nit I'd change is have a definition what SSA is right at the top. It discusses SSA for quite a while \"SSA is a property of intermediate representations (IRs)\", \"it's frequently used\" and only 10 paragraphs down actually defines what SSA is> SSA stands for \u201cstatic single assignment\u201d, and was developed in the 80s as a way to enhance the existing three-argument code (where every statement is in the form x = y op z) so that every program was circuit-like, using a very similar procedure to the one described above.I understand it's one of those \"well if you don't know what it is, the post is not for you\" but I think it's a nice article and could get people who are not familiar with the details interested in it> The reason this works so well is because we took a function with mutation, and converted it into a combinatorial circuit, a type of digital logic circuit that has no state, and which is very easy to analyze.That's an interesting insight, it made sense to me. I only dealt with SSA when decompiling bytecode or debugging compiler issues, and never knew why it was needed, but that sort of made it click.reply",
      "Here's a concise explanation of SSA. Regular (imperative) code is hard to optimize because in general statements are not pure -- if a statement has side effects, then it might not preserve the behavior to optimize that statement by, for example:1. Removing that statement (dead code elimination)2. Deduplicating that statement (available expressions)3. Reordering that statement with other statements (hoisting; loop-invariant code motion)4. Duplicating that statement (can be useful to enable other optimizations)All of the above optimizations are very important in compilers, and they are much, much easier to implement if you don't have to worry about preserving side effects while manipulating the program.So the point of SSA is to translate a program into an equivalent program whose statements have as few side effects as possible. The result is often something that looks like a functional program. (See: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/ssafun.pdf, which is famous in the compilers community.) In fact, if you view basic blocks themselves as a function, phi nodes \"declare\" the arguments of the basic block, and branches correspond to tailcalling the next basic block with corresponding values. This has motivated basic block arguments in MLIR.The \"combinatorial circuit\" metaphor is slightly wrong, because most SSA implementations do need to consider state for loads and stores into arbitrary memory, or arbitrary function calls. Also, it's not easy to model a loop of arbitrary length as a (finite) combinatorial circuit. Given that the author works at an AI accelerator company, I can see why he leaned towards that metaphor, though.reply",

This is because SSA is incredibly nimble at the types of program analysis and transformation that compiler optimizations want to do on your code. But why?

Here I exclude games that are perpetually changing and/or have strategies locked behind progression systems and paywalls, such as TCGs and virtual deck builders. The very few exceptions I found were niche Discord communities around games like Tak, Hex, or Advanced Wars.When did we as a society lose the appreciation for these things? I get why including a component of dexterity in strategic video games (e.g. RTS) is to take full advantage of the medium, but all this in conjunction means we are very likely never to see another deeply studied cerebral game like go, chess, shogi, mahjong, etc. arise ever again.reply",

I used to work in decent depth with three phase bldc motors, so I feel I can say with some authority that these things _can_ be simulated, and while real world data is hard to exactly predict, getting something outside of the predicted range would generally be interpreted as a sign that your simulation isn't so good.

You have one or more sound generators, sine wave, saw tooth, etc. You have attack (how fast the sound reaches full potential), decay (how long that sound is played before it drops to sustain), sustain (how long the sound lingers), release (how long until the sound fades away to nothing).You have filters for the sound, low pass, high pass, distortion, etc. that process the audio into output audio.It\u2019s basic sound engineering. However, using a neural net to find interesting combinations and be able to label them would be really fun to build a catalog of dreamscapes or tones.reply",

The larvae would hatch prematurely thinking it was spring and be killed by another freeze before they could get a foothold.That hypothesis relies on a pretty careful climatic balance though. Clearly it's hit a point where some parts of the country can now support endemic populations.

      "Hi all, this is a small research prototype I built that connects Rust's MIR (Mid-level IR) to Coq, the proof assistant used for formal verification.cuq takes the MIR dump of a Rust CUDA kernel and translates it into a minimal Coq semantics that emits memory events, which are then lined up with the PTX memory model formalized by Lustig et al., ASPLOS 2019.Right now it supports:* a simple saxpy kernel (no atomics)* an atomic flag kernel using acquire/release semantics* a \"negative\" kernel that fails type/order checkingThe goal isn't a full verified compiler yet. It's a first step toward formally checking the safety of GPU kernels written in Rust (e.g. correct use of atomics, barriers, and memory scopes).Happy to hear thoughts from folks working in Rust verification, GPU compilers, or Coq tooling.reply",
