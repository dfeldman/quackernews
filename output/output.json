      "This actually feels like an amazing step in the right direction.If AI can help spot obvious errors in published papers, it can do it as part of the review process. And if it can do it as part of the review process, authors can run it on their own work before submitting. It could massively raise the quality level of a lot of papers.What's important here is that it's part of a process involving experts themselves -- the authors, the peer reviewers. They can easily dismiss false positives, but especially get warnings about statistical mistakes or other aspects of the paper that aren't their primary area of expertise but can contain gotchas.\n \nreply",

      "Students and researchers send their own paper to plagiarism checker to look for \"real\" and unintended flags before actually submitting the papers, and make revisions accordingly. This is a known, standard practice that is widely accepted.And let's say someone modifies their faked lab results so that no AI can detect any evidence of photoshopping images. Their results get published. Well, nobody will be able to reproduce their work (unless other people also publish fraudulent work from there), and fellow researchers will raise questions, like, a lot of them. Also, guess what, even today, badly photoshopped results often don't get caught for a few years, and in hindsight that's just some low effort image manipulation -- copying a part of image and paste it elsewhere.I doubt any of this changes anything. There is a lot of competition in academia, and depending on the field, things may move very fast.

Programming one (if you can call it that)  required a bit of mathematical nous (which I didn't have enough of, though I was pretty sharp at digital), and the academic I worked with (who did) used to spend a lot of time saying \"f*ck\" as he tried to set up things like predator-prey simulation demos for the students.\n \nreply",

Before I could compose myself to say anything though, he and his wife had left to find the correct line. Obviously I couldn\u2019t be sure it was him, but I checked Knuth\u2019s public schedule and he was apparently speaking at some conference in Venice about two weeks later, so I\u2019m guessing he decided to come a bit early and enjoy a vacation before the conference.So yeah, I\u2019m like 99% sure I technically corrected an error by Donald Knuth, but unfortunately I missed out on my reward check. Didn\u2019t even get a selfie with him.\n \nreply",
      "Great post. Some general takeaways for people who want Knuth checks:1. You are unlikely to find errors in the algorithms themselves, especially if they've been officially published. You might find some infelicities, but these are not counted as full errors. For example, the author here found some confusing-but-not-wrong comments about local variables and unused registers. These are counted as \"suggestions\" (worth 0x20\u00a2) rather than \"errors\" (worth 0x$1.00).2. Knuth is pretty generous with credit -- if your suggestion leads him to find an error, you get credit for the error. The author here said that some defined variables went unused. Knuth pointed out that those variables were in fact used in an exercise. However, in looking this up he noticed a variable-related error in that exercise. Author is credited with 0x$1.00!3. Exercises are more likely to contain errors and infelicities than the main text. And there are an awful lot of exercises.4. Knuth includes a whole bunch of stuff in his books that is not related to CS. Lots of weird trivia and references. This stuff is more likely to be wrong than the main text. For example, Knuth mentions \"icosahedral objects inscribed with Greek letters\" and includes a reference to an article in the Bulletin de l\u2019Institut fran\u00e7ais du Caire. But the author points out that the article is actually in the Bulletin de l\u2019Institut fran\u00e7ais d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie orientale. Whoops! 0x$1.00 for you!\n \nreply",

Regarding the performance, I think you could get a lot better performance by training a small classifier model, essentially an embedding model, and using the LLM as the distillation source. This would both be much smaller, addressing your desire for it to run in browser, while also being much more performant, addressing your quantization need.

      "Funny story about testosterone enanthate dosing... so, I take it for body image/dysphoria reasons (to make myself more androgynous, basically) but I'm not a cisgender man. My body produces very little testosterone on its own.The doctor started me on a \"midrange\" dose of enanthate: 75mg every 10 days. My levels shot up, at the very high end of the male range. I brought that down to 75mg every 2 weeks and it barely budged.This is the exact same drug/formulation that a lot of these guys are taking for TRT. The highest \"official\" dose is 100mg every 7 days. (I'm sure some of them are taking even more than that, but that's as much as a doctor should be prescribing you.)Obviously everyone metabolizes this stuff differently, and if you're tall/heavy you'll likely need a higher dose than someone of average stature like me. But if my T levels shot up from ~20 ng/dL* to ~900 on a very moderate dose of enanthate, how high are those levels getting for someone who's starting from ~500?* The normal female range is anywhere from 15 to 70. The normal male range is anywhere from 200 to 1000.\n \nreply",

      "For men who are truly deficient (not the podcaster/TRT clinic definition where everyone is deficient) going on a true replacement dose of TRT is a good life improvement.Even those patients are often disappointed when the TRT doesn\u2019t solve their problems.The high doses used by TRT clinics shoot past that threshold and go for levels that were previously only used by people using testosterone for performance enhancement.The really hard thing about this topic is that a lot of the negative effects don\u2019t show up right away. It\u2019s sometimes months or years later before people realize their testes are so shut down that they\u2019re dependent on TRT for life, for example. People also go into loops of trying to manage high estrogen (a side effect of high TRT doses) where they crash their estrogen, going into deep depression, or get it wrong and end up growing excessive breast tissue that needs to be physically removed.High testosterone levels (beyond normal physiological range) are also associated with lower cognition. It makes people feel more confident, though, so this also isn\u2019t noticed. Anxiety disorders are also a common side effect of excessive dosing.The list goes on and on. Unfortunately mainstream podcasts on this topic are woefully bad at covering it because they know listeners only want to hear about the positives. Even the supposedly good podcasts like Huberman Lab are a joke on this topic. The TRT forum people love picking apart how bad Huberman\u2019s TRT takes are, even though he positions himself as being moderate on the subject.\n \nreply",
      "> Objective  To investigate how social media posts discuss 5 popular medical tests: full-body magnetic resonance imaging, the multicancer early detection test, and tests for antimullerian hormone, gut microbiome, and testosterone.Testosterone has become a favorite topic of social media influencers and podcasters. In parallel, clinics have been popping up all over the country to do nothing other than diagnose people with \"low testosterone\" and get them started on testosterone prescriptions.Two important things that are always left out of the conversation:1. Taking exogenous testosterone causes testicular atrophy. The body recognizes that there is enough (or more than enough) testosterone and stops stimulating the testes to produce more. This causes them to atrophy, gradually losing their ability to produce adequate amounts of testosterone.2. Almost everyone who starts injecting testosterone (or creams, etc) will feel better at first. The initial change of the added testosterone on top of what your body was already producing in one sudden upswing leads to feelings of energy, motivation, and well-being. This fades over time as your body adjusts to the exogenous testosterone.These two facts are critical to understand before starting testosterone, but they're almost never discussed on social media or podcasts. Shady TRT clinics actually benefit from those two points because the first one means customers become physically dependent on the product and the second means that they'll immediately feel like it solves all of their problems.The really problematic TRT clinics are now doing things that make the problem even worse:1. They offer free testosterone blood tests, but if the numbers aren't actually low they'll find another way to justify prescribing. Common techniques are to use non-standard reference ranges (e.g. claiming everyone should have 1000ng/dL levels) or having you fill out a big questionnaire of \"low T symptoms\" and then saying they treat the symptoms, not the blood test.2. Advertising on the radio. There are multiple TRT clinics in my area who advertise their TRT as a way to \"get an edge in the gym or at the office\". They aren't even trying to hide it.3. Prescribing enormous doses. A local TRT clinic chain has been prescribing high doses to everyone who comes in the door, resulting in some very excessive levels in patients. This can lead to many problems, including Gynecomastia (male breast growth).It's a big topic among my doctor friends because they're seeing an increasing number of guys show up either asking to have someone take over their TRT prescriptions (the clinics usually don't do insurance), asking how they can get off TRT without crashing out, or dealing with various health problems from excessive dosing.\n \nreply",
      "I'd agree that testing for low (or \"low\") testosterone seems like the most potentially harmful of these tests. It's directed towards a specific diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, that treatment is likely to be offered by the same clinic that performed the test, so there's potentially a lack of oversight.By contrast, broad-spectrum tests like full-body MRI or MCED seem less prone to abuse. They may be unnecessary, but they don't have as much of an incentive to find a diagnosis, and anything they pick up will probably get reviewed (and treated, if appropriate) by someone outside the clinic.\n \nreply"

      "I'm equal parts amused and bewildered that this author with so many interesting thoughts has managed not to see what pretty much every other serious reader of Lord of the Rings has pointed out over decades - the entire story is about a weak and almost completely unknown set of people who were \"chosen\" only by the most inexplicable series of events anyone could imagine - who through no inherent power of their own manage to save the world by nothing more or less than the choice to be kind to a pitiful (though clearly treacherous) creature... and who then go right back home where they belong, dismissing any notion of chosenness beyond the ordinary sort where everyone is chosen to do what is good for their neighbors.the Hobbits pursued not greatness or destiny, but took the only path toward life available to them and then returned to let the rest of the world get on with living.\n \nreply",

Here for example, the author's point seems to just be \"don't be Sauron.\"> What I have a problem with is people trying to live forever as part of a Chosen One script which involves them trying to carve up all of the world into the dead empires of a dystopian Great Game world run according to a totalizing script.I'm confident Tolkien would agree.I also think any evaluation of LoTR should take into account Tolkien's background as a veteran of the trenches in WWI. In 2025 America, maybe that makes LoTR seem less relevant to our world. To someone living in Ukraine, it probably feels like a much closer fit.\n \nreply",

Von Clausewitz will now tell us exactly who the real enemy is. Von?\"XO Hunter: \"In my humble opinion... in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.\"I think that's the difference. In WWII, appeasing Hitler was a mistake because it only emboldened him. Even back then, Tolkien had reservations about how far to take the war. While he abhorred Hitler, he initially supported Neville Chamberlain's \"appeasement\" policy.But today, a nuclear Russia cannot be defeated the way Germany was. \"In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.\"We cannot allow a nuclear war to happen, even if it means letting Putin have Ukraine.The question everyone is wrestling with is, how do we save Ukraine while preventing nuclear war? Unfortunately, we don't know the answer, and the risk of getting it wrong is catastrophic.\n \nreply",
      "> We cannot allow a nuclear war to happen, even if it means letting Putin have Ukraine.As soon as you decide this, and let others know you have, you have lost everything. Because if that logic applies to Ukraine it applies equally to Poland, to Alaska, France, to Washington, D.C., to your hometown.  You've committed to surrender everything to any power that has the potential to escalate to nuclear war.(It's even worse if you don't believe this -- or if you think you do but would think differently if the thing to surrender was closer to home -- and let people think you do, because that makes it almost inevitable that things will escalate beyond your trigger point, resulting in nuclear war.)\n \nreply",

      ">by Alec's excellent video which I recommend everyone watch.I get what your advice is about but to add some nuance which didn't cover... you should consider that I learned of Alec's Technology Connections channel 9 years ago because the Youtube algorithm suggested it to me.Why did Youtube do that?  It was because I had watched Ben's Applied Science excellent video showing vinyl grooves under an electron microscope:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCdsyCWmt8So the first Alec video I got exposed to was his related topic on vinyl records (click \"Oldest\" to see them) :  https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections/videosI'd argue that the Youtube algorithm is very good at finding adjacent videos of interest especially in educational topics and DIY repair tutorials.You're suggesting people go to Youtube subscriptions feeds but people have a list of favorites in their subscriptions often because of the algorithm.  There's a bit of chicken-vs-egg situation going on there.What a good algorithm does is help users with the Explore-vs-Exploit tradeoff:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration%E2%80%93exploitati...- Explore --> Youtube algorithm sidebar recommendations of related videos.- Exploit --> add a worthy creator to subscription feed and get alerted to new releases from that personThe \"explore\" part is helped by algorithms because they can suggest videos you would have never thought of because you don't know the keywords or jargon to type into a Youtube search box to get to it directly.  \"You don't know what you don't know.\"But don't use the algorithm for politics or click on anything that has a thumbnail with the shocked Pikachu face.  That just starts a feedback loop of crap.Arguably, the algorithms could put one into a non-productive engagement loop never to escape.  Personally, I don't think it's a big risk for educational/DIY topics because your brain gets saturated with \"too much information\" and hits a stopping point where you don't want to learn any more.So...

      "What the author demonstrates here is a powerful principle that dates back to LISP's origins but remains revolutionary today: the collapse of artificial boundaries between program, data, and interface creates a more direct connection to the problem domain.This example elegantly shows how a few dozen lines of Clojure can replace an entire accounting application. The transactions live directly in the code, the categorization rules are simple pattern matchers, and the \"interface\" is just printed output of the transformed data. No SQL, no UI framework, no MVC architecture - yet it solves the actual problem perfectly.The power comes from removing indirection. In a conventional app, you have:\n- Data model (to represent the domain)\n- Storage layer (to persist the model)\n- Business logic (to manipulate the model)\n- UI (to visualize and interact)Each boundary introduces translation costs, impedance mismatches, and maintenance burden.In the LISP approach shown here, those boundaries disappear. The representation is the storage is the computation is the interface. And that direct connection to your problem is surprisingly empowering - it's why REPLs and notebooks have become so important for data work.Of course, there are tradeoffs. This works beautifully for personal tools and small-team scenarios. It doesn't scale to massive collaborative systems where you need rigid interfaces between components. But I suspect many of us are solving problems that don't actually need that complexity.I'm reminded of Greenspun's Tenth Rule: \"Any sufficiently complicated program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp.\" The irony is that by embracing LISP principles directly, you can often avoid building those complicated programs in the first place.Rich Hickey's \"Simple Made Easy\" talk explores this distinction perfectly - what the industry calls \"easy\" (familiar tools and patterns) often creates accidental complexity. The approach shown here prioritizes simplicity over easiness, and the result speaks for itself.\n \nreply",
      "Over time I\u2019ve come to see LISP less as the natural collapse of artificial boundaries but the artificial collapse of natural ones. Where and how data is stored is a real concern, but where and how the program is stored isn\u2019t. Security boundaries around data and executable code are of paramount importance. Data storage concerns don\u2019t benefit from being mixed with programming language concerns but from computer and storage architecture concerns (eg column stores).In toy programs, such as this one, those concerns can all be discarded, so LISP is a good fit. But in serious systems it\u2019s soon discovered that what is offered is in fact  \u201csimplistic made easy\u201d. That\u2019s not to say that traditional systems don\u2019t suffer from all the ills Hickey diagnoses in them, but that we differ on what the cure is.\n \nreply",
      "> It doesn't scale to massive collaborative systems where you need rigid interfaces between components. But I suspect many of us are solving problems that don't actually need that complexity.Here's the issue.  Starting out you almost certainly don't need that rigid interface.  However, the longer the app grows the more that interface starts to matter and the more costly retrofitting it becomes.The company I currently worked at started out with a \"just get it done\" approach which lead to things like any app reaching into any database directly just to get what it needs.  That has created a large maintenance issue that to this day we are still trying to deal with.  Modifying the legacy database schema in any way takes multiple months of effort due to how it might break the 20 systems that reach into it.\n \nreply",
      "My take on what the issue is, is primarily in the ramifications of Conway's law and how our social structures map to systems.When the system is small, it makes a great deal of sense to be an artisan and design simple automations that work for exactly that task, which for the most common things is always supported by any production-oriented programming environment - there's a lot of ways in which you can't go wrong because the problem is so small relative to the tools that any approach will crush it. \"Just get it done\" works because no consequence is felt, and on the time scale of \"most businesses fail within five years\", it might never be.When it's large, everyone would prefer to defer to a common format and standard tools.  The problems are now complex, have to be discussed and handled by many people, they need documentation and clear boundaries on roles and responsibilities. But common formats and standards are a pyramid of scope creep - eventually it has to support everyone - and along the way, monopolistic organizations vie for control over it in hopes of selling the shovels and pickaxes for the next gold rush. So we end up with a lot of ugly compatibility issues.In effect, the industry is always on this treadmill of hacking together a simple thing, blowing out the complexity, then picking up the pieces and reassembling them into another, slightly cleaner iteration.Maintenance can be done successfully - there are always examples of teams and organizations that succeed - but like with a lot of infrastructure, there's an investment bias towards new builds.\n \nreply",

The core idea in the post was just finding a way for code to edit it's own constants so that I don't need a separate datastore.Eventually I couldn't get this working the way I wanted with clojure and I had to write a simple language from scratch to embed provenance in values - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43303314.\n \nreply",

One could make the argument that LLM applications with MCP support are conceptually similar to browsers \u2014 both let users connect to arbitrary MCP/HTTP servers at runtime.But the comparison with HTTP is not a very good one, because  MCP is stateful and complex.

Yes. Is current \u201cAI\u201d simply a re-brand of machine learning? IMO, also yes\n \nreply",
      "Exactly Any junior developer can reason about API and integrateBut LLm will replace them?\n \nreply",
      "1) Valid point, this could haven been wsdl/swagger. But the MCP spec supports spinning up local applications and communicate via stdio which open api cannot do.2 + 3) having a few commands that AI knows it should call and confidently so without security concern, is better than just give AI permision to do every thing under the sun and tell it to code a program doing so.The prompt for the later is also much more complex and does not work as predictably.\n \nreply",
      "What the article doesn't say (well, there's a lot it doesn't say) is that this protocol was created by Anthropic but is being adopted more widely.MCP reminds me of a new platform opportunity akin to the Apple App Store.It's rapidly adopted, with offerings from GitHub, Stripe, Slack, Google Maps, AirTable, etc. Many more non-official integrations are already out there. I expect this will only gain adoption over the coming year.\n \nreply",
      "Yes. The article comes across as a response from an LLM chat. I think that it's OK to write blog posts with AI assistance, and I like the logical and simple writing style that these models output.But with MCP there's not a whole lot of information out there for LLMs to digest and so perhaps for that reason the article is not particularly insightful.Thank you HN for bringing the insights!\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a new open protocol designed to standardize how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs).Think of MCP like a USB-C port but for AI agents: it offers a uniform method for connecting AI systems to various tools and data sources.This post breaks down MCP, clearly explaining its value, architecture, and how it differs from traditional APIs.The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that connects AI agents to various external tools and data sources. Imagine it as a USB-C port - but for AI applications.The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that connects AI agents to various external tools and data sourcesJust as USB-C simplifies how you connect different devices to your computer, MCP simplifies how AI models interact with your data, tools, and services.Traditionally, connecting an AI system to external tools involves integrating multiple APIs. Each API integration means separate code, documentation, au"
