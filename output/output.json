      "I compile a lot of C++ code from a lot of places, and the only time I run into code that somehow simply doesn't work on newer versions of C++ and where the developers aren't even sure if they will accept any patches to fix the issue as they claim it \"isn't supported\" to use a newer version of C++--even for the public headers of a library--is, you guessed it: code from Google.Meanwhile, most of the C++ code from Google seems to be written in some mishmash of different ideas, always at some halfway point along a migration between something ancient and something passable... but never anything I would ever dare to call \"modern\", and thereby tends to be riddled with state machines and manual weak pointers that lead to memory corruption.So... I really am not sure I buy the entire premise of this article? Honestly, I am extremely glad that Google is finally leaving the ecosystem, as I generally do not enjoy it when Google engineers try to force their ridiculous use cases down peoples' throats, as they seem to believe they simply know better than everyone else how to develop software.Like... I honestly feel bad for the Rust people, as I do not think the increasing attention they are going to get from Google is going to be at all positive for that ecosystem, any more than I think the massive pressure Google has exerted on the web has been positive or any more than the pressure Google even exerted on Python was positive (not that Python caved to much of it, but the pressure was on and the fact that Python refused to play ball with Google was in no small part what caused Go to exist at all).(FWIW, I do miss Microsoft's being in the space, but they honestly left years ago -- Herb's existence until recent being kind of a token consideration -- as they have been trying to figure out a tactical exit to C++ ever since Visual J++ and, arguably, Visual Basic, having largely managed to pivot to C# and TypeScript for SDKs long ago.

But perhaps this could be a way forward that could allow both camps to have their cake and eat it too.Imagine a world where the main difference between Python 2 and 3 was the frontend syntax parser, and each module could specifically which syntax (\"Edition\") it used...\n \nreply",

How do you denote a.cpp be of cpp_2017 edition which b.cpp be cpp_2026? Some per-file comment line at top of each file?C++ is a mess in that it has too much historic baggage while trying to adapt to a fiercely changing landscape. Like the article says, it has to make drastic changes to keep up, but such changes will probably kill 80% of its target audiences.

      "A prerequisite to understanding is knowing the CTE syntax (\"WITH\"). That's just a group of SQL queries that can refer to one another. It's extremely useful for making modular SQL queries and has nothing to do with recursion.Then when you use \"WITH RECURSIVE\", the queries can now refer back to themselves. This is just a for loop over a queue of SQL results, conceptually. The part before the UNION ALL fills the queue to start, and the part after the UNION ALL runs once for each result in the queue, adding all results back into the queue.If you understand this, then you can understand the Sudoku or Mandelbrot examples (definitely don't start with trying to understand these two though). For example, the Sudoku example contains one recursive query, \"x(s, ind)\". As explained on the page, \"s\" is the puzzle (unsolved spaces shown as \".\") and \"ind\" is the index of the first unsolved space (or 0 for a solved puzzle). It creates an unsolved puzzle in the initial setup. The for loop body finds all valid values for the first unsolved space, and the next index to solve; then puts all these results into the queue. The final (non-recursive) SELECT in the CTE looks over all results in the queue, and returns the one where the index is 0 (the solved puzzles).\n \nreply",

      "Might be worth updating the title to \"SmolLM: state-of-the-art small language model trained on open datasets\" (See the first table of https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm for benchmarks)It was fascinating digging into this to find their dataset weights defined in a declarative YAML file [2]. 70% is from FineWeb/Commoncrawl but filtered using a classifier trained on Llama-70b's rating from 0-5 of the educational content of the text [3]. This is something we know small models like Phi-3 have been doing for a while, but it's great to see a fully open reproduction of it that beats their benchmarks. Definitely supports the idea you can get even better reasoning at smaller model sizes by carefully filtering and curating your training data (and generating good synthetic data from/distilling bigger models).You can see the 450k Llama educational value scores here:\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu-ll...\nIt's interesting, I think the text with 3 scores is really good, but the 5 scores pick content that is not very reasoning or information-heavy but just mentions education or a worksheet.

At the next size level up, in other comparisons I've seen that e.g. Phi-3.5 (which is ~3.8B params) does a bit better than Llama 3.2 3B. Gemma 2 has a 9B size, llama 3.1 has an 8B size and I think when that came out Mistral had a 7B model -- so whenever a new \"small\" thing does \"better\" than its peers, we can't easily see whether it's because of any of the many small choices that the authors made were actually better.\n \nreply",

      "> Modern garbage collection assumes that the weak generational hypothesis holds and that most objects die youngAside, I'm curious how first-class support for value types and Go-style stack allocation via escape analysis changes the value proposition of the generational hypothesis. If we hypothesize that short-lived objects are local to a single function scope (and thus eligible for stack allocation either explicitly via a value type or heuristically via escape analysis) then it might completely upend the generational hypothesis and make it so that relatively more long-lived objects are getting heap-allocated. Surely someone's done some studies on this?\n \nreply",
      "> it might completely upend the generational hypothesisThe generational hypothesis is about object lifetime, and that doesn't change.It does change the relevance of the generational hypothesis to garbage collection.> Surely someone's done some studies on this?The go team has, and that's why go doesn't have a generational GC. The complexity of adding generational support, especially in a mutation-based language (so needing memory barriers and the like) was found not to benefit when a significant fraction of the newborn objects don't even reach the youngen. See https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/70257#discussioncom... from the current discussion of adding opt-in ad-hoc support for memory regions.\n \nreply",
      "If you flip the argument on its head you can frame it as: since most objects die young it's very likely they will stay on the stack and thus it makes sense to invest in an allocation-site optimizer that will put the object on the heap only if static escape analysis says it may escape the lexical scope.\n \nreply",

      "Go has much more significant stack allocation capabilities, most notably it has no problem allocating entire structs on the stack so doesn't need scalar replacement, which falls over if you breathe on it (https://pkolaczk.github.io/overhead-of-optional/).According to https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/70257#discussioncom...> the weak generational hypothesis does not hold up well with respect to heap-allocated memory in many real-world Go programs (think 60-70% young object mortality vs. the 95% typically expected)\n \nreply",
      "I'm open to believing that this is true, but some real numbers would be nice.

      "I've seen a bit of confusion regarding this. First, it's 10% of Denmark's total land area, which is roughly equivalent to 15% of farmland area. Second, the conversion of farmland area into nature and forests is mainly for improving water quality, as excess nitrogen from agriculture has essentially killed the rivers and coastal waters through oxygen depletion from algae.Regarding global warming and CO2, the area conversion of peatlands will help, but the major change here is the introduction of a carbon tax for the entire agricultural industry. And to end confusion regarding other emissions than CO2, it's actually a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) tax, which includes a range of other gasses. E.g., 1kg of methane is 25kg CO2e.If you'd like to read more, see the two PDF documents below, which are the main official documents.

I trust my doctor and my doctor trusts their sibling, but I don't necessarily trust their sibling.With that being said, I think there's a pretty rich research space here, and I think the edge/local aspects of this design are pretty interesting!

      "Jessica Tallon's implementation of petnames and edge names was extremely simple within the paper davexunit linked, but used in-band mechanisms to communicate edge names that didn't require any sort of large trusted authority.  You could retrieve them directly from fellow peers, who could publish their current set of edge names.  This even works in a p2p context over ocapn, etc.  The implementation was naive but it did work and used a publish-subscribe mechanism directly from other peers.That said, edge names are only one way to share contacts.  In fact \"share contact\" on peoples' phones is a great way to have contextual sharing: \"Oh, let me introduce you to my friend Dave. Here's Dave's contact info!\"At any rate, petnames aren't a particular technology, they're a design space of \"Secure UI/UX\".

      "I have long been a fan of petnames, and graph naming systems in general.I like to use the term \u201cnickname\u201d for what they call \u201cedge names\u201d in the article: a nickname is not as personal as a petname, it\u2019s a name you share with others.An interesting thing that the article sort of hints at is that these kinds of systems have a fairly smooth range of operating points between globally unique and centralized vs decentralized petnames. The article\u2019s example of the bizdir local business directory is somewhere in between these extremes. It sort of turns Zooko\u2019s triangle into more like a fan, where the \u201chuman friendly\u201d point is fixed and there\u2019s an arc describing the tradeoffs, from personal through local to global.How can a petname system function at the global+centralized point, so it could replace the DNS? It needs to pass the \u201cbillboard test\u201d: I type in a name I saw on a billboard and I get to the right place. (It might be a multipart name like a postal address or DNS name, with an extra \u201cedge name\u201d or two to provide enough disambiguating context.) I imagine that an operating system supplier might provide a few preconfigured petnames (well, it probably includes its own petname so the software can update itself securely), a lot like its preconfigured PKIX CA certificates. These petnames would refer to orgs like the \u201cbizdir\u201d, or Verisign, or Nominet, that act as nickname registries. Your collection of petnames is in effect your personal root zone, and the preconfigured petnames are in effect the default TLDs. There would inevitably be something like the CA/Browser forum to mediate between OS suppliers and nickname registries: a petname ICANN.I wrote an older iteration of these ideas over a decade ago (https://dotat.at/@/2012-02-28-path-names-in-a-rootless-dns.h...).

Notice that if you interpret the train error as the entropy of the data (i.e. error under a cross entropy loss), then the models which satisfy the statistical generalization bound correspond to those which best compress the data. In other words: the model which produces the shortest description of the data is the one which is expected to generalize best.\n \nreply",
      "> It doesn't matter if the model is deterministic or probabilistic: a probabilistic model can be used to (losslessly) compress a dataset with entropy coding.But if you can choose to lose information you can obviously achieve a higher compression score. That's literally what optical & auditory compression exploits. Indeed, we know people generally don't memorize the entire Wikipedia article. Rather they convert what they learn into some internally consistent story that they can then recite at any time & each time they recite it it's even differently worded (maybe memorizing some facts that help solidify the story).Again, I have no problem with compression and decompression being equated to intelligence provided both are allowed to be lossy (or at least one facet of intelligence). That's because you get to inject structure into the stored representation that may not otherwise exist in the original data and you get to choose how to hydrate that representation. That's why LZMA isn't \"more intelligent\" than ZIP - the algorithm itself is \"smarter\" at compression but you're not getting to AGI by working on a better LZMA.It's also why H264 and MP3 aren't intelligent either. While compression is lossy decompression is deterministic. That's why we can characterize LLMs as \"more intelligent\" than LZMA even though LZMA compresses losslessly better than LLMs.\n \nreply",
