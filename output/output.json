      "An underrated quality of LLMs as study partner is that you can ask \"stupid\" questions without fear of embarrassment. Adding in a mode that doesn't just dump an answer but works to take you through the material step-by-step is magical. A tireless, capable, well-versed assistant on call 24/7 is an autodidact's dream.I'm puzzled (but not surprised) by the standard HN resistance & skepticism. Learning something online 5 years ago often involved trawling incorrect, outdated or hostile content and attempting to piece together mental models without the chance to receive immediate feedback on intuition or ask follow up questions. This is leaps and bounds ahead of that experience.Should we trust the information at face value without verifying from other sources? Of course not, that's part of the learning process. Will some (most?) people rely on it lazily without using it effectively? Certainly, and this technology won't help or hinder them any more than a good old fashioned textbook.Personally I'm over the moon to be living at a time where we have access to incredible tools like this, and I'm impressed with the speed at which they're improving.reply",
      "> Learning something online 5 years ago often involved trawling incorrect, outdated or hostile content and attempting to piece together mental models without the chance to receive immediate feedback on intuition or ask follow up questions. This is leaps and bounds ahead of that experience.But now, you're wondering if the answer the AI gave you is correct or something it hallucinated. Every time I find myself putting factual questions to AIs, it doesn't take long for it to give me a wrong answer. And inevitably, when one raises this, one is told that the newest, super-duper, just released model addresses this, for the low-low cost of $EYEWATERINGSUM per month.But worse than this, if you push back on an AI, it will fold faster than a used tissue in a puddle. It won't defend an answer it gave. This isn't a quality that you want in a teacher.So, while AIs are useful tools in guiding learning, they're not magical, and a healthy dose of scepticism is essential. Arguably, that applies to traditional learning methods too, but that's another story.reply",
      "> But now, you're wondering if the answer the AI gave you is correct> a healthy dose of scepticism is essential. Arguably, that applies to traditional learning methods too, but that's another story.I don't think that is another story. This is the story of learning, no matter whether your teacher is a person or an AI.My high school science teacher routinely mispoke inadvertently while lecturing. The students who were tracking could spot the issue and, usually, could correct for it. Sometimes asking a clarifying question was necessary. And we learned quickly that that should only be done if you absolutely could not guess the correction yourself, and you had to phrase the question in a very non-accusatory way, because she had a really defensive temper about being corrected that would rear its head in that situation.And as a reader of math textbooks, both in college and afterward, I can tell you you should absolutely expect errors. The errata are typically published online later, as the reports come in from readers. And they're not just typos. Sometimes it can be as bad as missing terms in equations, missing premises in theorems, missing cases in proofs.A student of an AI teacher should be as engaged in spotting errors as a student of a human teacher. Part of the learning process is reaching the point where you can and do find fault with the teacher. If you can't do that, your trust in the teacher may be unfounded, whether they are human or not.reply",

      "> How are you supposed to spot errors if you don't know the material?By noticing that something is not adding up at a certain point. If you rely on an incorrect answer, further material will clash with it eventually one way or another in a lot of areas, as things are typically built one on top of another (assuming we are talking more about math/cs/sciences/music theory/etc., and not something like history).At that point, it means that either the teacher (whether it is a human or ai) made a mistake or you are misunderstanding something. In either scenario, the most correct move is to try clarifying it with the teacher (and check other sources of knowledge on the topic afterwards to make sure, in case things are still not adding up).reply",

      "When I grew up I would spend hours looking through all the plastic model kits at the local hobby store. I just loved building plastic models.I never mastered painting them. The most advanced I got was rattle-can style spray paints \u2014 maybe masking a bit for a camouflage or what-have-you. Only when I got older and got back into plastic model building did I make the leap to air-brushing and really finishing models correctly.So many YouTubers (Aztec Dummy comes to mind) have since showed me that assembling the model is more or less nothing. Painting, lighting the model is everything.I can't complain though. There was a joy putting together the models when I was young. The smell of the glue of course \u2014 the spatial reasoning it fostered... It was like sculpture to my young mind \u2014 forms, shapes in three-dimensions. I grew to love the lines of certain cars, planes, spacecraft\u2026I think too it fueled a kind of designer mindset in me. I would soon draw cars, spaceships, etc. of my own design.What a great hobby.I'm saddened that it kind of seems like another hobby, like R/C planes or model rocketry, that has fallen by the wayside. I mean I feel like most boys when I was growing up had a model or two hanging from their bedroom ceiling. Right?reply",
      "It's definitely not the hobby of choice for young boys any more, but it feels like it is having a golden age of kit quality aiming at an older audience with disposal income. Manufacturers like Tamiya, and also Eduard or Meng (those are my favs anyway) are producing extremely high quality kits.There is always consternation amongst modelers about where the next generation will come from, but the Gundam/Gunpla scene is supposedly very large in Japan and growing in the West.reply",
      "That's true \u2014 there are certainly a lot of variety now, especially with 3D printing and garage kits. The \"long tail\" has definitely been kind to the esoteric modeler.Adult-me recently took to designing a kit for a NASA \"Space Tug\" that never existed (only proposed \"artist's renderings\" from the 1970;s) [1]. It is so esoteric that no one made a kit for it \u2014 I had to learn to use Blender, ha ha.I just wish more kids were into modeling.[1] free to download: https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/Space-Tug_3DModelreply",
      "It is funny, as the metal 3D printer I've been working on is designed to handle printing/repairing large girder structures.  Making things work in vacuum is an interesting design challenge, but also opens a lot of design possibilities for arbitrary structures that can't launch on cargo rockets.People are often too judgmental these days, and youth must make their own decisions about the world they want to live in.If you know the history of how JPL started, than you can probably guess it is the \"odd\" ones that tend to change science for the better. =3reply",

Your air brush can have one or two controls - one for the amount of compressed air and one for amount of paint.

      "Oh boy, yea.I tried to put together a helicopter (probably an Apache) a few years ago, and got a couple of those classic Testor paint bottles to help finish it.I had to put it all away. The fumes from the paint, my reaction to it was nothing like I remembered. I had no issues with them as a boy. But, today, yea they were making me loopy. I\u2019m surprised the AQMD in California still allows these.I\u2019d like to try again with some modern acrylic, but the only place in my orbit is a Michaels, and they really don\u2019t cater much to plastic kits. So opportunity has bumbled my way yet.The other trick is to keep it me and not be intimidated by the YouTube experts. Easier said than done.reply",
      "If you don't have anything near you, I would look for acrylics designed for models online. Games Workshop sells them, but there are other brands (Vallejo, Reaper, etc) which are also quite good and generally cheaper. And they will, as a rule, be more pleasant to work with than the acrylics you get at Michael's/Hobby Lobby.reply",

A tiny circuit, with minimal components, that could automatically switch from ON to OFF and OFF to ON state (without an explicit \u201ctimer\u201d component).But there was one big problem: I didn\u2019t know the first thing about electronics, not even the difference between voltage and current. Plus, now I needed to learn what a resistor, a capacitor, and a transistor is.It was slow going, "

      "Nice having this backstory (fantastic production value too, impressive start to this podcast). Dis-aggregating the responsibilities of the DB into multiple pieces just feels so logical, helps make sure each piece can scale. Deterministic Simulation Testing gets mentioned in the video & was way ahead of it's time here. https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/testing.htmlHacker News is here too! From July 2012 (78 points, 72 comments): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4294719For a general introduction, I enjoyed the recent submission How FoundationDB works and why it works:\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37552085\nhttps://uvdn7.github.io/notes-on-the-foundationdb-paper/reply",
      "Posted about this in the past, but what really got FoundationDB on my radar was a demo at a developer conference, back in 2014-ish. They had the database running across a bunch of machines, with a visual showing their health and data distribution. One team member would then be turning machines on and off (or maybe unplugging them from the network) and you could see FDB effortlessly rebalancing the data across the available nodes. It was a very striking, impressive presentation (especially as we were dealing with the challenges of distributed Cassandra at the time).The beginning of this video has some of that: https://youtu.be/Nrb3LN7X1Pgreply",
      "Does anyone know how widely FoundationDB is now being used at Apple? I know they run a huge Cassandra cluster, does this serve a different use case?reply",
      "FoundationDB has been growing as my favorite database lately. Even though it is only key-value store.Out of curiosity: what are the scale limits of FoundationDB? What kind of issues would it start to have? For example, being able to store all of Discord messages on it?I see blog posts of Discord moving to Scylla and ElasticSearch, but I wonder if there would be any difficulties here.reply",
      "What a great story and really interesting courage to double-down on improving the testing even when a critical flaw that testing should have found was found. Wish that they had managed long enough for Snowflake to keep them alive, but then we wouldn't have Antithesis as a service so silver lining.reply",
      "By \"keep them alive\", you mean the team, right? People are definitely still using FDB!reply",
      "I can't put my finger on it but there's a weird tension between the two Dave's in this video. Almost like Rosenthal is trying to impress or earn the praise of Scherer.Is there a backstory between these guys / FDB?reply",

      "The amount of people who get really defensive when people actually point out that, no, your iPhone is not in anyway comparable to an actual dedicated camera is kinda crazy.reply",
      "The points really boil down to:1. Difference in focal length/ position.2. Difference in color processingBut\u2026the article is fairly weak on both points?1. It\u2019s unclear why the author is comparing different focal lengths without clarifying what they used. If I use the 24mm equivalent on either my full frame or my iPhone, the perspective will be largely the same modulo some lens correction. Same if I use the 70mm or whatever the focal length is.2. Color processing is both highly subjective but also completely something you can disable on the phone and the other camera. It\u2019s again, no different between the two.It\u2019s a poor article because it doesn\u2019t focus on the actual material differences.The phone will have a smaller sensor. It will have more noise and need to do more to combat it. It won\u2019t have as shallow a depth of field.The phone will also of course have different ergonomics.But the things the post focuses on are kind of poor understandings of the differences in what they\u2019re shooting and how their cameras work.reply",
      "Agreed, in particular the distortion of the players on the ends, the smaller shoulders and chest, as well as the lean can all be attributed to the wider lens used on the iPhone (and as such that the photo was taken closer to players). I'd guess the author was using the \"1x\" lens on the iPhone, a lot of these issues go away if they use the \"3x\" or \"5x\" lens. I'd even consider that most of the jawline change of the player is simply the angle of their chin/face as well as expression.reply",
      "My entry-level mirrorless camera with its kit lens can take photos that blow my recent-model iPhone out of the water.Add a nice lens and there's no comparison.However:- The iPhone is always in my pocket (until I crack and buy a flip-phone)- The iPhone picture always turns out, but the Canon takes a modicum of skill, which my wife is not interested in, and I'll never be able to teach passers-by when they take a group picture for us- The iPhone picture quality, though worse, is still fineLooking back at travel and family pictures, it has been very much worth it for me to have a dedicated camera.reply",
      "I agree with your iPhone camera advantages, but to that list I'd add that I'm already going to buy an iPhone, which means any comparison of value for the price is effectively between the price of a camera (which for even an entry-level mirrorless isn't exactly cheap) and literally zero dollars.  You could argue that the phone would be cheaper without the nice camera to make for a fairer comparison, but such a product doesn't really exist.reply",
      "This applies only if you assume that you are not willing to spend more on a phone with a better camera and a lot of people do. I have friends who decided to buy an iPhone over way cheaper Android phones in the past, because \"the iPhone camera was so much better\". Funny enough, the differences were obviously negligible when compared with any actual camera.reply",

      "Phone cameras don't come close to any of my \"real\" cameras with my decades of experience shooting and composing ... but phone cameras absolutely obliterate anything I was shooting with a film camera as a beginner back when film was a thing. I have also arguably learned far more about photography with my phone, because of its portability and zero cost experimentation, than I have with ANY \"real\" camera.But, perhaps most importantly, along the lines of what others have noted: you know, my phone camera may not be as good, but I have zero complaints about the impromptu photos of my kid growing up that I could never have caught with anything else.reply"

      "> Two years ago when I first tried LLaMA I never dreamed that the same laptop I was using then would one day be able to run models with capabilities as strong as what I\u2019m seeing from GLM 4.5 Air\u2014and Mistral 3.2 Small, and Gemma 3, and Qwen 3, and a host of other high quality models that have emerged over the past six months.Yes, the open-models have surpassed my expectations in both quality and speed of release. For a bit of context, when chatgpt launched in Dec22, the \"best\" open models were GPT-J(~6-7B) and GPT-neoX (~22B?). I actually had an app running live, with users, using gpt-j for ~1 month. It was a pain. The quality was abysmal, there was no instruction following (you had to start your prompt like a story, or come up with a bunch of examples and hope the model will follow along) and so on.And then something happened, LLama models got \"leaked\" (I still think it was a on purpose leak - don't sue us, we never meant to release, etc), and the rest is history. With L1 we got lots of optimisations like quantised models, fine-tuning and so on, L2 really saw fine-tuning go off (most of the fine-tunes were better than what meta released), we got alpaca showing off LoRA, and then a bunch of really strong models came out (mistrals, mixtrals, L3, gemmas, qwens, deepseeks, glms, granites, etc.)By some estimations the open models are ~6mo behind what SotA labs have released. (note that doesn't mean the labs are releasing their best models, it's likely they keep those in house to use on next runs data curation, synthetic datasets, for distilling, etc). Being 6mo behind is NUTS! I never in my wildest dreams believed we'll be here. In fact I thought it would take ~2years to reach gpt3.5 levels. It's really something insane that we get to play with these models \"locally\", fine-tune them and so on.reply",
      "I'll bite. How do i train/make and/or use LoRA, or, separately, how do i fine-tune? I've been asking this for months, and no one has a decent answer. websearch on my end is seo/geo-spam, with no real instructions.I know how to make an SD LoRA, and use it. I've known how to do that for 2 years. So what's the big secret about LLM LoRA?reply",
      "We have been fine-tuning models using Axolotl and Unsloth, with a slight preference for Axolotl. Check out the docs [0] and fine-tune or quantize your first model. There is a lot to be learned in this space, but it's exciting.0: https://axolotl.ai/ and https://docs.axolotl.ai/reply",
      "When do you think fine tuning is worth it over prompt engineering a base model?I imagine with the finetunes you have to worry about self-hosting, model utilization, and then also retraining the model as new base models come out. I'm curious under what circumstances you've found that the benefits outweigh the downsides.reply",
      "For self-hosting, there are a few companies that offer per-token pricing for LoRA finetunes (LoRAs are basically efficient-to-train, efficient-to-host finetunes) of certain base models:- (shameless plug) My company, Synthetic, supports LoRAs for Llama 3.1 8b and 70b: https://synthetic.new All you need to do is give us the Hugging Face repo and we take care of the rest. If you want other people to try your model, we charge usage to them rather than to you. (We can also host full finetunes of anything vLLM supports, although we charge by GPU-minute for full finetunes rather than the cheaper per-token pricing for supported base model LoRAs.)- Together.ai supports a slightly wider number of base models than we do, with a bit more config required, and any usage is charged to you.- Fireworks does the same as Together, although they quantize the models more heavily (FP4 for the higher-end models). However, they support Llama 4, which is pretty nice although fairly resource-intensive to train.If you have reasonably good data for your task, and your task is relatively \"narrow\" (i.e. find a specific kind of bug, rather than general-purpose coding; extract a specific kind of data from legal documents rather than general-purpose reasoning about social and legal matters; etc), finetunes of even a very small model like an 8b will typically outperform \u2014 by a pretty wide margin \u2014 even very large SOTA models while being a lot cheaper to run. For example, if you find yourself hand-coding heuristics to fix some problem you're seeing with an LLM's responses, it's probably more robust to just train a small model finetune on the data and have the finetuned model fix the issues rather than writing hardcoded heuristics. On the other hand, no amount of finetuning will make an 8b model a better general-purpose coding agent than Claude 4 Sonnet.reply",
      "Do you maybe know if there is a company in the EU that hosts models (DeepSeek, Qwen3, Kimi)?reply",

      "Since Japan has exactly one timezone and most services are intended for use within Japan, many Japanese programmers are unaware of timezone-related logic. I've frequently encountered Japanese sites store dates as OffsetDateTime instances (rather than UTC Instants), and have frequently seen subtle bugs, like a web app's backend returning UTC+9 timestamps, and then subsets of the frontend format the date according to the user's local time. I witnessed this last week on a fairly big concert ticket website. The lottery application datetime was simply formatting the OffsetDateTime returned by backend. Then, for some reason, the lottery result announcement datetime was being passed through a different formatting function. So two adjacent timestamps were in different timezones and there were no visual indications of this; I learned a lot about the site's API when investigating. I later reported the bug and was told the service is not intended for use outside of Japan, so they won't fix.I've also encountered games where device local time results in bugs when certain features are gated to durations within Japanese standard time. For one particular game, I contacted support and the response was similarly \"this service is intended for use within Japan; please ensure your device time is set to Japanese Standard Time.\"To most programmers in the US or Europe, storing all dates as UTC and localizing datetimes (with a recently updated tzdb) in the frontend may seem like \"common sense\", but this is essentially \u7570\u6587\u5316 to many Japanese programmers, for lack of a better way to phrase it.reply",
      "There's a larger design issue here that becomes clearer if you think of timezones as something more like temporal reference frames. Every date and/or time is relative to something; it's just a question of whether that reference is explicit or implicit, and if it's implicit then how does it get resolved?Your original code (inadvertently) used a UTC day: T00:00:00Z -> T24:00:00Z. Your new code uses a day in an implicit timezone, which gets resolved by the client (to its local time). So, if you send that dashboard to someone in Singapore or Australia, their day is going to be an hour off compared to what you see.Ultimately, the design issue is: when someone says \"Tuesday\", do they mean Tuesday in their local time? Tuesday in Japan? Tuesday in the location of their company HQ? Tuesday in the timezone where they do the most business?I think a lot of the reason people get mad about timezones is because they don't think clearly about their reference frames from the beginning, which leads to getting caught up in implicit time spaghetti later on.reply",

I will reach for Date when I need to deal with weird stuff like the day of the week but having burned through so many footguns with what I consider the worst DateTime API I have ever dealt with in any language, I will do anything I can to avoid using it.Some libraries like date-fns can help here, but can't always bring in new deps easily.

People hate this stuff.I hate all of the half-cooked non-TOTP MFA methods that I'm forced to use. Just let me use my freaking authenticator app. If you believe that your users prefer (or maybe it's just you?) more databroker-friendly methods, then fine, but please at least provide TOTP as an option.reply",
      "I wish that banks would offer TOTP. SMS is famously insecure and poorly suited for something that\u2019s a load-bearing pillar in most of our lives, and TOTP is probably the most reasonable replacement. Unfortunately only a tiny handful of US banks offer non-SMS 2FA of any kind, and to my knowledge the one that does (Scwhab I think?) requires the use of a hardware gadget even though it\u2019s standard TOTP (which people have written python scripts to extract the necessary bits of info from).reply",

Worst thing is IMHO Microsoft now which seem to have also shut off the TOTP option and use some other propriatary 2FA scheme now.

Sometimes, the Google match-a-number MFA flow is good enough.I thought I'd share here my best ideas for the future of multi-factor authentication. Here they are.We like entropy in auth factors, so it's intuitive to start with a familiar example of randomness: playing cards. For example, Wikipedia says there are about 2.5 million unique poker hands.That makes poker hands a compelling secondary authentication factor. Here's what a simple version of the UI could look like: challenge the user to pick exactly five cards from a set of 52.It's incredibly easy to remember your hand. Just ask any of your friends that play poker -- they can surely remember a bad beat. And it's pretty mu"

Mobile-targeted Linux distributions aren't good (missing functionality, mobile UX, or both).  The linked distribution is running Debian in a container for desktop on top of Android.  The rumors about the future of ChromeOS are imagining something similar.Recent iterations of iOS are getting closer to being able to replace a Mac for a class of tablet-owning users who don't need desktop software, but the ecosystems are pretty well separated for most.Adapting desktop Linux to mobile seems to be impossibly hard with the amount of resources those distributions have.reply",
