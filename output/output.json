      "You know the craziest thing about watching this as an outsider in Canada is that we as a nation are losing one reliable trading partner (and obviously losing an ally but that's another conversation). Germany - losing a trade partner. Japan? And so on. But the US has lost 180 reliable trading partners. You're already seeing in the first week burgeoning trade alliances between nations who wouldn't have cooperated before, and the amount of resentment against America from this is going to take a generation to heal.Of course I'm sure some people would claim this is 4D chess or what not but.. sometimes the person doing something crazy is just crazy at the end of the day.\n \nreply",
      "Very well put. Alliances take years to build but can be broken in just days.I'm tempted to think (hope? dream?) that the markets and trade will rebound if all this chaos makes American politics swing back towards an interest in global stability, but I think anyone partnering with the US would do so VERY carefully and right now the entire world is plotting how to remove US dependencies.\n \nreply",
      "I think that those in command are also waiting for the next President to undo all that but it is going to have a tremendous effect for a decade or more. Hopefully for the US they won't go in a similar crisis like the UK is going through...Cutting off countries like Japan or Taiwan like that when we know their geopolitical situation with China and how critical their economy is to the US is quite crazy.\n \nreply",
      "This. There is no reason why any country should trust us anymore if entire trade relations can be destroyed by a presidential whim.Even if Trump fell out of a window today and we got a pro-trade president tomorrow, we\u2019re not fixing this damage for a very long time.We probably would have to amend the constitution to insulate foreign policy from the whims of a single person if we want any chance of fixing this in our lifetime.\n \nreply",
      "> Hopefully for the US they won't go in a similar crisis like the UK is going through...Err.. do tell about the UK's larger crisis than US'?\n \nreply",

      "It's not 4D chess. It's not even 1D chess.Sparking the local industries needs to happen with incentives, not a tsunami.You can't swap the supply chain to a local-first instantly. Many things aren't done locally. The factory buildings are gone. The labor isn't there or trained. The basic materials aren't local and need to be imported. The machines needed to produce the parts don't exist locally and need to be imported themselves; sending your profit margins down the drain.What it is, is another flip of the table, an upset, to cause chaos and feed a positive environment for more chaos, which only suits those who benefit from chaos.\n \nreply",
      "I think less 4d chess and more Erlich Bachman school of negotiation. Bullying people in inferior bargaining positions has somehow worked thus far.\n \nreply",
      "When the bully gets too ambitious the large number of bullied gang together for revenge, or at least effective countermeasures. The world will route around USA, find they can manage ok without it. The USA will be iced out, lose its reserve currency status, nobody will buy its military technology, making the USA unable to recoup large outlays for ambitious military projects, and the USA will lose its military dominance.Also, the future of warfare and terrorism is autonomous networks of drones. The USA and Canada won't be disposed to care what passes through their borders with the USA, and like Zelensky said ... we had the oceans and friendly neighbors, but that won't help us anymore.\n \nreply",
      "Totally agreed! But bulling 95% of class room... That doesn't work. New alliances would emerge, like Canada and the EU. No more new pipelines for the US but more upgrades to Canadian ports to ship oil to the EU. New economic routes will be created, new partner deals, etc... Without the US.Trump just locked the US, kinda did the finger to the earth, and hopes people will come begging for trade.\n \nreply"

      "I was just thinking about this yesterday. A few weeks or months ago I started learning something new from an online course.Because I like using Anki to help me remember, I started copy-pasting stuff from that course to a spreadsheet to then export it as a CSV to import into Anki.One thing leading to another, my spreadsheet quickly ended with weird formatting everywhere that would be converted through macros to HTML tags to style the resulting Anki notes.This was still implying much manual work, so I finally figured I could just scrape the lessons for which I want notes via some script, and get the resulting CSV with a simple command.I'm been working on that scraper for two weeks now, and I just realised yesterday that that's the most time I've spent on a side project since too long to remember, and it brings me joy and motivation in the evenings and weekends. Also, apart from the occasional script, I haven't wrote a line of code for years, and I don't know why I ever stopped coding since I love this so much. And last but not least, I decided to go for Python, and I've never learnt Python so it's quite a challenge but also a satisfactory experience.All in all, this side project is spaghetti code with a dirty hacks sauce, I would never open-source it,  and it's never going to be useful for someone other than me.But it feels like I'm dusting off my brain, and rediscovering skills and passions I had long forgotten. Like finally waking from a long slumber. I'm currently a bit depressed, struggle to focus, and feel burnt out, but at least I am motivated by something and I create something for me, and this makes all the rest bearable.\n \nreply",
      "> I decided to go for PythonGreat choice and keep going! At my last job, we actually created and sold Anki decks and I can tell you that Python was the main language we used for this. In fact, it's also one of the main languages used to build Anki (it's built with PyQt + Rust & Svelte).\n \nreply",
      "It almost certainly would be useful for someone other than you. \nEverything you described automating is something at least thousands of people also do. And most of them don't care about the code quality if it works.\n \nreply",
      "I feel this in a side project way but also in a hobby project way.Blissful Zen is a great way to put it.Story: My mother had 2 of her 3 dogs die on the same day. We buried them in the backyard as we have many little friends before them. This was the first time I dug the graves (my dad had always beared that -- but he passed away last year).The grave soil was very clay rich. I had recently seen a video on how to reclaim natural clay. It was very rewarding to turn the natural clay into workable clay.But the real challenge -- how to fire it? I saw guys using charcoal and bricks in their driveway but that can't get hot enough.So the real Zen has been building an electric kiln from scratch. It is a simple-ish problem with a whole lot of simplish steps. Perfect to keep my mind occupied when it needs to be. I have also learned an amazing amount (about clay, pottery, kilns, Arduino/ESP32, thermocouples, resistance wire, refractory cement, insulation, electrical code, weird soldering techniques, and many more).First fire will be tomorrow.\n \nreply",
      "It's an interesting read. I'm in the complete opposite camp. I can't pick up a game controller for more than 5 minutes without feeling like I'm wasting time.This has lead to many, many side projects throughout the years, which I tend to like a zen garden[1]. Pruning, refining, improving, and sometimes rewriting.As soon as I work out the game mechanics of any game, I just see it as just content now, and there is nothing holding me back to play any longer. Same with watching TV shows or movies, I lose interest pretty quickly and feel an urge to create something.I've always been very in tune with time, our lack of it, and felt like consumption is a waste of time.That said I believe creativity is hormonal (that is only my personal belief, unproven). It comes and goes. Some days I can't stop creating, somedays I want netflix and chill. But that's 10 days cycle of sorts, 10 days on, 10 days off.Depending on where you live, it's perfectly normal that due to current events, or a personal loss in your life, etc. you might not feel the creative bug tickling you. The creative hormone might be totally wiped by your current environment or predicament; tiredness, anger, stress, all play into it.After all, since our early days in the caves, drawing on walls, Humans wouldn't do so unless they had safety, a full belly, and a warm fire. A place to call home. Creative time needs conditions to be filled.[1] https://noben.org\n \nreply",
      "I'm the same, and it has kind of ruined me. No one I know thinks the ways I do. I keep wondering if it's just due to anxiety or a fear of death, or an inability to feel present or what. But I really wish I could figure this aspect of myself out so that I can relax and enjoy in a moment.Whenever I realize that I was lost a moment, I get anxious about what I should be doing with my time instead.\n \nreply",
      "I feel this in my bones.  Side projects are so cathartic and saved my sanity at $DAYJOB.  I don't care that I can't implement things the way I want, or how everything is spaghetti, or how much tech debt has piled up, my side projects is a blissful world that I invented.  It gives me the \"I am Jack's crap codebase\" fight club zen at work.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah. There is something about carving out the image of your own mind and getting absorbed deep inside it. I will write from scratch much more than I need if it strikes me, break whatever rule I want, give names that only make sense to me.  It is a sanctuary\n \nreply",
      "My latest side project started a couple weeks ago when I received an email from Cox that they would be forcing an unmanageable wifi network onto my router so that their cell customers would get more wifi coverage or something.So I ordered a DOCSIS 3.1 modem off amazon, then went and rummaged around in my storage box for an old 2013 macbook air, installed ubuntu server on it, and finally learned how to setup a home router with DHCP, DNS, NAT, firewall, etc. Pihole was a lot of that, and I installed it as a docker container so that was a fun thing to learn to manage as well.As an aside, ChatGPT made most of this possible. I have used *nix off and on for 25 years but haven't done serious system administration in at least 15 years. ChatGPT is definitely the crutch I needed to get off my ass and do more side projects.\n \nreply",

      "I'm always a bit saddened to see that a separate chip is the go-to method to interface with USB. Unfortunately USB is an incredibly-complex protocol that it seems anything beyond a basic V-USB running USB 1.1 at low-speed is generally not doable without specialized hardware and a significant software stack.  Meanwhile a protocol like SPI is ridiculously simple...the minimum hardware needed is a shift register that can be clocked fast enough. I miss how desktop and labtops used to have an exposed serial and parallel port, which could communicate at this low level. I often wonder if instead of USB existing that we instead stuck with UART, I2C, or SPI multidrop (using a small set of standard clock rates) for simple peripherals (maybe over a single connector like the 4-pin JST SH cable for Stemma QT, Qwiic and Grove) over a short distance, and then jumped to IEEE 802.3 Ethernet links for data-heavy peripherals like monitors and external drives. Then instead of having to have separate support for USB and Ethernet, you just would support Ethernet links.\n \nreply",
      "> Meanwhile a protocol like SPI is ridiculously simpleYes, it is.  It was intended to require as little silicon as possible to minimize the cost to the transistor budget.  SPI doesn't contemplate power supply, hot-plug, discovery, bit errors, or any other of a host of affordances you get with USB.I think there is some value for software developers to understanding SPI and the idioms used by hardware designers with SPI.  Typically, SPI is used to fill registers of peripherals: the communication is not the sort of high level, asynchronous stuff you typically see with USB or Ethernet and all the layers of abstraction built upon them.  Although there is no universal standard for SPI frames, they do follow idiomatic patterns, and this has proven sufficient for an uncountably vast number of applications.\n \nreply",

      "My favorite Tcl story is a little side note about how Tcl could have been the language of the web[1]  the founding of Netscape   occurred at the same time I was deciding where to go in industry when I left Berkeley in 1994. Jim Clarke and Marc Andreessen approached me about the possibility of my joining Netscape as a founder, but I eventually decided against it (they hadn't yet decided to do Web stuff when I talked with them). This is one of the biggest \"what if\" moments of my career. If I had gone to Netscape, I think there's a good chance that Tcl would have become the browser language instead of JavaScript and the world would be a different place! However, in retrospect I'm not sure that Tcl would actually be a better language for the Web than JavaScript, so maybe the right thing happened.\n\n\nToo humble Dr. Ousterhout!  It would have been a far better language.1 - https://pldb.io/blog/JohnOusterhout.html\n \nreply",
      "I was leading a Tcl project around then, and, though there were some very neat things about the unusual Tcl evaluation model, I wasn't a fan of using it for nontrival work.  For example, it wasn't a natural fit for working with graph structures like I had to, and like you might want for browser DOM.(That said, Tcl would've been much better than JS, and I suspect that Ousterhout would've figured out some smart things to make it good for the browser.)Maybe 5 years later, I was meeting with Tim-Berners Lee, and I kinda pitched Scheme to him, without planning to, but he was very interested when he asked what I'd been working on.But then he went and did a conference keynote, in which he promoted Python as the language for ordinary people doing Web stuff.  And I think he referenced one of the things I'd written in support of Scheme... as an anti-requirement for his populist vision for the Web. :)(I wish I could've been involved in that, because I could've made a case for a populist spin on Scheme at the time.)\n \nreply",
      "I think Tcl as it was back then especially would have been a terrible DOM manipulation choice. I love the language but the hacks frameworks like openacs used to use to imitate basic stuff like a list of database records are among the ugliest upvar/up level hacks I've seen.But that being said it's an incredibly adaptable language and I have zero doubt it could have been adapted to make DOM manipulation ergonomic.\n \nreply",

We made it serve, but it kept getting in our way. It\nmade maintenance harder, and it made extensions harder to write...Tcl was not designed to be a serious programming language.

We flirted with this territory by subjecting the rich to a very different justice system than the poor, but we are now solidly in the territory of no limits to rich people's power so long as they don't threaten other rich people.We are now in the realm of having to consider not what is allowed to be done, but what can be done. We can no longer ask what is legal to do, only what is possible to do. It is possible for several men to ambush a person, put them in a car, put them in chains, and send them to a black site without due process. That is a thing that can physically happen in reality.  That is a thing that has happened in other countries. Locking political opponents in mental institutions is a thing that can happen. While it seems unlikely that it will happen here, \"intellectuals,\" those with the capability of challenging those in power, have been rounded up and forced to dig their own graves. Babies have been smashed against trees. That is a thing that has happened in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge at the killing fields. That is a thing that is possible to happen. Forced labor camps are a thing that can and has happened. Mass famine as a result of disastrous government policy is a thing that can and has happened. Extermination of humans based on genetic traits is a thing that can happen.There is no magical power that prevents these things from happening.

      "So, let me see what I think I understand here:1. AI models are good at C\u00e6sar-cypher transposition, because it occurs often enough in training models for certain values of the cypher offset.  Outside those values, AI doesn't handle the transformations well.2. Somehow AI models perform this cypher also within high ranges of Unicode, because the characters are encoded as three tokens each, of which the last one encodes the same difference as between alphabetic letters, and so the first two tokens get discarded as irrelevant, meaning that by sheer chance the alphabet maps perfectly via C\u00e6sar-cypher (with a two-token offset) to a specific range of Unicode characters reserved for Byzantine music notation.3. This is easy to understand for one AI model, because its explicable by chance that the offset between the alphabet and Byzantine music notation should coincide perfectly with two less-significant tokens.  It's harder to understand why this works in more than one AI model, though.\n \nreply",

      "Anyone who has read Moby Dick knows that this passage:> And since whaling technology had come along so much since the 19th century - with powerful diesel engined vessels equipped with ever more lethal harpoons and even onboard processing plants, allowing sailors to drain the spermaceti out of their catches at sea rather than having to bring them back to land - sperm whale populations were ravaged long, long after the discovery of kerosene.contains a distinct factual error. The whalers were processing their catch at sea even in the 1800s. Probably not as efficiently, but still they were not dragging their catch back to land for processing.\n \nreply",
      "The bit about the usefulness for lubrication is fairly wrong.  To put it simply, it's useful because it's a corrosion inhibitor.  And while it works it degrades pretty rapidly in a hot gearbox.  Synthetic alternatives were simply better.   And they were developed and gaining traction before the ban, because they were better.  Industrial machinery mostly doesn't need those properties.  Whale oil is a poor lubricant by itself though it can look decent if your frame of reference is what's available in the 1860s.Between what you found and what I found I think the whole thing is kinda sus.Edit: To clarify, Whale oil is hydroscopic-ish but in a weird way, not like glycol (I'm not a chemist so IDK).  My understanding is that it makes some sort of film that's protective against condensation. Gearboxes operated outdoors don't generally need this corrosion inhibitor.  It has to do with the glues used on or in automatic transmission friction material and how very sensitive they are to water.  You can't have water building up from ambient conditions and short trips or they'll delaminate.  Your alternatives without something like this are rivets or different glue, both of which perform worse and cost more.\n \nreply",
      "The synthetic alternatives became better only much later. A blast from the past, from the old web, wher e competence meets ugly web design:\"It was true that increased heat load destroyed the modified sperm oil in the ATF faster. The problem was that its freshly developed synthetic analogs were performing even worse. Only in the 1980s, a chemical solution to this problem was found, and I highly doubt that it could have been found earlier. Now we have the pieces of the story:Sperm whales use unusual rheological properties of wax esters in order to control buoyancy, and these properties also make such chemicals an ideal lubricant for extreme pressure applications. When the world relied on whales as a source of hydrocarbons, these were too expensive to use as fuels, and the demand was self-limiting. When the whales were \u201csaved\u201d by petrochemical industry, it was only a short respite. Petrol-powered machinery required new types of lubricants that increased rather than decreased the reliance on sperm oil. Petroleum was plentiful, the cars filled the world, and it is at that point that the whales began to disappear. Literally nothing was done to save these whales until the cars evolved to the point when the engines started to operate at a higher temperature; the latter was caused by the concern about human health and efficiency rather than the well being of these whales.\"https://shkrobius.livejournal.com/347646.html (2011)\n \nreply",
      "His overall point, that it happened later, after different technological innovations, and required government regulation is correct though\n \nreply",
      "I think government regulation probably only advanced the inevitable.  Synthetic substitutes were developed for performance (temperature tolerance and service life).  It was likely only a matter of time until said substitutes made their way back into older specifications for oil due to natural economic incentives.Perhaps there would still be some niche whaling if not for the ban, but it would be for a niche use, not because literally every automatic transmission in the country needs a cup of the stuff.\n \nreply",
      "Often when there is government regulations it is because those regulated approve.  Not always, but often.  Oil refineries are attacked in the press by government, but when they want a permit to do something it is always quietly granted.\n \nreply",
      "> Perhaps there would still be some niche whaling if not for the banThere is still whaling. Iceland, Japan, Norway, North American indigenous peoples and the Danish dependencies of the Faroe Islands and Greenland continue to hunt in the 21st century. \nWorse, Iceland, Japan and Norway still engage in and supporting commercial hunting.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whaling\n \nreply",
      "There is stil some niche whaling. It's all done for meat, but if there was any industrial value for some parts of the whale, I imagine that would be extracted and sold. I don't think there's anything like that.\n \nreply",
      "Recall that sea shanty business a few years ago with the talk of the Weller Brothers, a NZ outfit that delivered supplies to whaling vessels so they did not have to return to harbor as frequently.The implication of the song is that the Weller Brothers would provide supplies on credit based on the progress of the whaling expedition. The sailers are singing about capturing a whale that leads to hopes of resupply coming soon.Less time traveling back and forth to hunting grounds is more time for violence, and that\u2019s the calculus of the whole sordid business.\n \nreply",
      "Moby Dick itself contains a ton of factual errors (even accounting for the state of knowledge contemporary to its writing) about whales and whaling. I think in this case it still points you in the right direction but that's mostly just luck.And it is mostly focused on the habits of one particular whale fishery. Others are discussed but not in depth and the bias of the narrator in regard to them is itself an important part of the story. I don't know either way but it's plausible to me that other fisheries, positioned closer to their whaling grounds, would have dragged them back for processing.\n \nreply"

I setup an online shop to just to sell a red shirt with the word on it. The next day my whole shop was taken offline for potential copyright infringement.What I found surprising is I didnt even have one sale. Somehow someone had notified Nintendo AND my shop had been taken down, to sell merch that didn't even exist for the market and if I remember correctly - also it didnt even have any imagery on it or anything trademarkable -  even if it was clearly meant for pokmeonGo fans.Im not bitter I just found it interesting how quick and ruthless they were.

      "I asked Sora to turn a random image of my friend and myself into Italian plumbers. Nothing more, just the two words \"Italian plumbers\". The created picture was not shown to me because it was in violation of OpenAI's content policy. I asked then just to turn the guys on the picture into plumbers, but I asked this in the Italian language.\nWithout me asking for it, Sora put me in an overall and gave me a baseball cap, and my friend another baseball cap. If I asked Sora to put mustache on us, one of us received a red shirt as well, without being asked to. Starting with the same pic, if I asked to put one letter on the baseball caps each - guess, the letters chosen were M and L.\nThese extra guardrails are not really useful with such a strong, built-in bias towards copyright infringement of these image creation tools.\nShould it mean that with time, Dutch pictures will have to include tulips, Italian plumbers will have to have a uniform with baseball caps with L and M, etc. just not to confuse AI tools?\n \nreply",
      "You (and the article, etc) show what a lot of the \"work\" in AI is going into at the moment - creating guardrails against creating something that might get them in trouble, and / or customizing weights and prompts under water to generate stuff that isn't the obvious. I'm reminded of when Google's image generator came up and this customization bit them in the ass when they generated a black pope or asian vikings. AI tools don't do what you wish they did, they do what you tell them and what they are taught, and if 99% of their learning set associates Mario with prompts for Italian plumbers, that's what you'll get.A possible (probably already exists) business is setting up truly balanced learning sets, that is, thousands of unique images that match the idea of an italian plumber, with maybe 1% of Mario. But that won't be nearly as big a learning set as the whole internet is, nor will it be cheap to build it compared to just scraping the internet.\n \nreply",

There's people who do reels or \"commentary\" of a movie scene and then put some horrible high pitched music to mask it from copyright.There's probably even some rules around this to only detect just enough to take legal action. Like GP stumbled on a trademark landmine, but obviously just selling red shirts with a bird on it can't be a trademark violation; it needs to be a specific kind of red too.\n \nreply",
      ">> they do what you tell them and what they are taught, and if 99% of their learning set associates Mario with prompts for Italian plumbers, that's what you'll get.I thought that a lot of the issues were the opposite of this, where Google put their thumb on the scale to go against what the prompt asked. Like when someone would ask for a historically accurate picture of a US senator from the 1800s and repeatedly get women and non-white men. The training set for that prompt has to be overwhelmingly white men so I don't think it was just a matter of following the training data.\n \nreply",

I don't see any way you can get the AI to recognize that Vikings \"should\" be white people and not also think that Italian plumbers \"should\" look like that. Are they allowed to recombine their training data or must they strictly adhere to only what they've seen?Of course the irony is that if the people who get offended whenever they see images of non-white people asked for a picture of \"Vikings being attacked by Godzilla\" , they'd get worked up if any of the Vikings in the picture were Asian (how unrealistic!).

We would be pissed if a human artist did that, so we are pissed when AIs do it.A human, even one whose only experience of an Italian plumber is Mario will be able to draw an Italian plumber who is not Mario. That's because he knows that Mario is just a video game character and doesn't even do much plumbing. He knows however how an actual non-Italian plumber looks like, and that a guy doing plumbing work in Italy is more likely to look like a regular Italian guy equipped like a non-Italian plumber than to a video game character.And if asked to draw a Viking, he knows that Vikings are people originating from Scandinavia, so they can't be Asian by definition, even in an Asian context.

Why are we justifying internet outrage over an Asian Viking when people have been drawing this middle-eastern Jew as white for centuries?> A human artist can adjust things to the unrealistic setting, but unless presented with a really good reason, will not change the core traits of what makes a Viking a Viking.If you asked Matt Stone and Trey Parker to draw a Viking, are you sure it would contain the \"core traits of what makes a Viking a Viking?\" What if you asked Picasso to draw a Viking? The Vikings in The Simpsons would be yellow, and nobody would complain. Would you be offended if you asked Hokusai to draw a Viking and it came out looking Asian? Vikings didn't even have those stupid horned helmets that everyone draws them with! Is their dumb, historically inaccurate horned helmet a core part of what makes a Viking a Viking? What the hell are we even talking about? It's crystal clear that all of these \"historical accuracy\" drums are only ever beaten when some white person is offended that non-white people exist. Otherwise, nobody gives a shit about historical accuracy. There's a fucking Kaiju in the image!Like any artist, Gemini had a particular style. That style happened to be a multi-cultural one, and what we learned is that a multi-culture style is absolutely enraging to people unless it results in more Whiteness.Consider elves instead of Vikings. People would also be offended if an AI drew elves as black people with pointy ears. There's no \"a human artist should know that elves have to be white\" bullshit defense there. There's no historical accuracy bullshit. There's only racism.\n \nreply",
      "The AIs were not \"naturally\" generating images of Asian Vikings. It was established to my satisfaction, even if the companies never admitted it (I don't recall it happening but I may have missed it), that it was actually the prompt being rather hamhandedly edited on the way to the image generator, for the clear purpose of \"correcting\" the opinions and attitudes of those issuing the prompts through social engineering.Unsurprisingly, people don't like being so nakedly herded in their opinions. When the \"nudges\" become \"shoves\" people object.\n \nreply"

      "I feel like this is missing a really important factor: how likely are guests to use airbnb again after staying at a listing?A listing could look great online and receive a lot of bookings (so high LTV), but ultimately drive users away from the platform.A certain ad platform I worked on cared a lot about this - offensive ads could get you to quit the site altogether. You might want to count every ad as positive for the company since you make money, but some might actually be negative expected value! As a side note, I think this is a really undermeasured problem. There are many sites I won't use because the ads are so overwhelming or are often offensive.\n \nreply",
      "> A listing could look great online and receive a lot of bookings (so high LTV), but ultimately drive users away from the platform.I am precisely this kind of churned customer. I have personally booked maybe 3 AirBNB stays, and stayed with family in them on other occasions. The units I pick are always well-reviewed.But in the cities I've stayed in (LA, SF, Rome), the price is really no cheaper than a hotel, and the quality is extremely variable. You have to really carefully read those 5-star guest reviews to read between the lines.And you feel pressured not to leave a negative review, as that would negatively impact your ability to book in the future, since the hosts (I have heard) can see your average review score.My impression has been that AirBNB's customers are actually the hosts. You, the guest, are an expendable commodity. You will use AirBNB until you have a severe enough problem, and experience them siding with the host over you. Then you'll be churned permanently, and by force if you do a chargeback.If I were going to disrupt AirBNB, I'd offer hosts a better percentage with the requirement that the experience is standardized and high-quality. There would be an in-unit noise & vibration sensor, reporting directly in the app. 24 hour check-in and check-out. A minimum set of amenities, minimum WiFi speed. The bedding would be standard. Cleaning fee standard. Every unit subject to a surprise multi-point inspection at least once per year. Essentially, make it no worse than an average hotel, and maybe some units as good or better than high end hotels.\n \nreply",
      "> If I were going to disrupt AirBNB, I'd offer hosts a better percentage with the requirement that the experience is standardized and high-quality.This is an interesting idea, but it puts the quality level way above what I want to pay for.  Hotels are anti-septic and cold.  I like staying in an apartment that feels like someone actually lives there.  I don't mind a few dust-bunnies under the couch, nor a little dirt behind the toilet.  It's even better when the kitchen is fully stocked, including a selection of non-perishable food (think cooking oil, salt, pepper, maybe a bag of ground coffee and a box of pasta.)  Sure, the sheets and towels should be freshly laundered, but beyond that, I don't want much.AirBNB allowed me to pay less to get a more human-feeling space.  Hotels are like McDonalds, they are designed for the regular customer who wants to get that Hilton-feeling, regardless of if they are in Wichita or Cairo.  I want to feel like I'm in Cairo, and if that means that I'm in a mud brick house with a single bathroom, no A/C, and no daily housekeeping that's great!  AirBNB opened those worlds to us as travelers, in a way that hotel chains never did.\n \nreply",
      "I think that's more common in other parts of the world. (i.e. getting places that people actually live in).In Europe most/all of the apartments I've stayed in are basically business apartments (more or less).You don't feel that someone lives there because nobody actually lives there. It's like a long term rental apartment that in best case scenario someone is using as a savings/investment vehicle but on short term. \"Worst case\" it's part of an apart-hotel.When I travel as part of a large group(i.e. more than 3 people) a short term apartment is great because we need a big affordable space (i.e. someone may sleep on the couch and we don't want the hotel \"greetings & house keeping\" experience) but nevertheless I don't want or expect a dirty place in any way, shape or form be it in Cairo or somewhere else. I'm pretty sure there are people living in less than sanitary conditions all over the world including Western Europe and the U.S. That doesn't mean I have interest in experiencing that kind of \"living/sleeping\".All that being said I've stopped using Airbnb years ago.

As long as there are enough people like me to keep them afloat, they can provide a product that I am happy with, and you can stay at hotels that are immaculately clean.I do hate the way that many AirBNB hosts have made hosting a business, and would fully support a limit on the number of listings per host.  People renting out a space in their house, or a vacation rental in a vacation destination that they also stay in too is fine.  People buying 3 or more apartments to rent them out (taking them off the long-term rental market) is terrible, and should be prohibited.\n \nreply",
      "> My impression has been that AirBNB's customers are actually the hostsYes for sure. Avg # of transactions per host dwarfs avg # of transactions per guest. Same with revenue. A frustrated host who pulls a unit (often, multiple units) off the platform is much more detrimental than an individual customer leaving the platform.\n \nreply",
      "No model is perfect, but some are useful.  Their \"baseline LTV\" looks at the sum of listings on their platform (plus other features), then tries to forecast the next 365 days \u2014 so this should indirectly capture people coming and going.  I think their cannibalization model is quite clever as well.Going deeper with modeling users might yield some tighter estimates, but I imagine this gets estimates far closer than some simple accounting formula, and likely helpful for budgeting a year out \u2014 but it would have been nice to have seen some performance metrics.\n \nreply",
      "I also think the cannibalization model is clever. The baseline model is however a bit underwhelming,\nas bookings can be misleading by themselves - you have cancellations, impressions,\nand so forth. For example if you only look at bookings in next 365 days, new listings will be penalized. But as you said no model is perfect :-)\n \nreply",
      "In the case of Airbnb, wouldn't that show up in the listing's reviews, requests for refunds, etc. and ultimately drive down the listing's LTV?

When the album was released in February 1981, the cover was widely condemned as in bad taste \u2013 almost as bad as making a record so soon after he died (it was her highest-selling record to date).I\u2019ve been thinking about the photo for a day now, and I\u2019ve noticed telling questions sliding into my mind.

And it's not even possible to save one chat to disk (well, neither do the others), I just wish it did.AI Studio saving to Google Drive is really useful. I lets you download the chat, strip it of verbose things like the thinking process, and reuse it in a new chat.I wish gemini.google.com had a \"Save as Markdown\" per answer and for the complete chat (with a toggle to include/exclude the thinking process).

      "Most importantly, the use of novel antibiotics must be strictly prohibited in the animal food industry.This is crucial because the misuse of antibiotics in livestock farming has been a major driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a global health crisis. When antibiotics are overused or improperly applied in animals, bacteria can evolve to become resistant, rendering these life-saving drugs ineffective for treating infections in humans and animals alike.It has always been a perversity that life-saving reserve antibiotics were ever permitted to prop up the grotesque machinery of the modern food industry\u2014a system built on global-scale animal cruelty.\n \nreply",

      "Mmm why US specifically? The most overuse of livestock antibiotics is in India (and India has a lot of drug factories).\n \nreply",
      "And another major problem is that these antibiotics are found in nature.Penicillin production was revolutionized when it moved to Peoria, IL and found the famous cantelope:https://www.pjstar.com/story/news/local/2019/04/25/peoria-pl...\n \nreply",
      "US is well known for its questionable high scale farming practices that often have no interest in any sort of animal welfare. Its one of the primary reasons for import controls across Europe for US meat products. It comes up every time the UK or EU negotiate trade deals with the US and came up extremely often during Brexit.If those import markets were open European producers would struggle to compete with US-agri due to its sheer volume and lack of interest in animal welfare and/or disease control. The UK specifically suffered issues in the past with such issues via \"Mad Cow Disease\" in the 90s and has attempted to reform its practices as a consequence.Conversely US agri still seems to ignore these existential nightmares, as most recently seen with Bird Flu and the new administration's troubling ideas with how to deal with it (e.g. the suggestion to avoid culls in order to \"find resistent birds\").\n \nreply",
      "The US has a ton of problems with agriculture, but I find half of people's complaints about antibiotic use in US farming reaching far beyond what is actually happening in reality. I often hear people complain about antibiotics being in their milk or beef, but there are absolutely no antibiotics in your milk because a single cow on antibiotics getting its milk in a 10,000 gallon tanker will cause the entire load to be dumped, and it is tested for in every batch. As for beef, maybe once in awhile, but feeding a 1,200+ pound animal enough antibiotics for months to increase its weight that extra 5% is going to cost you nearly as much as the entire animal is worth.Poultry is an area where it might be a bigger problem because chickens grow WAY faster than cows and they live in absolutely deplorable conditions on factory farms. Birds need to be clean to stay healthy, and they can't stay clean stacked in little tiny cages or packed into dense flocks, and so they end up dosed with antibiotics because otherwise they need like 10x or more the land/floor area to not have swaths of the herd top die from natural diseases. A cow or pig covered in shit is just a cow or a pig, cow shit is basically dirt by time it comes out the other end it is so thoroughly digested, a bird covered in shit is going to be packed with disease and parasites.\n \nreply",
