      "To give it a different light: by using an indie web approach (i.e. self host), there is an intrinsic guarantee that a publisher has put at least some effort and resources to make their materials public.This ensures that the published materials have certain authenticity and inherent amount of quality. Publishing them \"the indie way\" functions as a kind of proof of work: not a guarantee of excellence, but evidence that something meaningful was at stake in producing and sharing it.By contrast, the corporate web has driven the cost of publishing effectively to 0. This single fact opens the floodgates to noise, spam, and irrelevance at an unprecedented scale.The core problem is that the average consumer cannot easily distinguish between these two fundamentally different universes. Loud, low-effort content often masquerades as significance, while quiet, honest, and carefully produced work is overlooked. As a result, authenticity is drowned out by volume, and signal is mistaken for noise.To sum it up: this is not so much a problem of the internet as a lack of discernment among its users.reply",
      "> To sum it up: this is not so much a problem of the internet as a lack of discernment among its users.This is very true. I've found that there's more good content than there ever was before, but that there's also much more bad content, too, so the good is harder to find.RSS helps me, curated newsletters help me. What else helps build this discernment?reply",
      "Ad driven centralization bad. Go make independent websites using open standards. I just saved you 5 mins.This spends a lot of time on mood setting and analogy and doesn\u2019t address: network effects, discovery economics, hosting and maintenance costs, security, spam and abuse mitigation, user incentives.It\u2019s aspirational rather than operational.reply",
      "I think the comments here are a great example of why this idea always sounds better in nostalgic reminiscence than in practice: As I write this, nearly half of the comments here are complaining about this website. There are complaints about requiring JavaScript, the font size, the design, the color choices, the animations. Complaints about everything the designer did to make this site unique and personal, which was the entire point of the exercise. This is coming from a site that supposedly attracts the target audience for this type of page.reply",
      "I've read your comment before visiting the site, and it got me wondering -- how bad can it be? Can it be worse than those acid green on red sites of the 90s-00s?Imagine my surprise, when I opened the site and it looked and felt just like a museum or art exhibit. This was the literal feeling I had -- being at an art gallery, but online.I guess, these comments tell more about the commenters, than TFA. We should remind ourselves to be more critical to the content we consume, regardless where it comes from.reply",
      "Yeah, its a really beautiful site.reply",
      "I think that social networks are not meant to be moderated at scale. We are meant to have what I call 'overlay networks': we occupy the same infrastructure but see content filtered to the style that befits us. Most social networks have the notion of friend symmetry, but I think that read-time filtering needn't be like that.To that end, I made a trivial Chrome extension and an equivalent CRUD backend that just helps me store lists of users I like and dislike. The former are highlighted, and the latter are simply removed from comments.As an example, the user I'm responding to is someone whose comments I like so I have had them in my highlight list for two months now and not regretted it https://overmod.org/lists/view?pk=ELpqNsanTYP9_wZXNjdF-FcEOc...My personal tool is particularly idiosyncratic but I think information sieving is particularly important these days, so I recommend everyone build something like this for themselves. One thing I've found it particularly helpful with is the usual outrage bait. But I also killfile users who I think particularly misunderstand the comments they respond to, and I also killfile users who express what I think are low-information views.reply",
      "I designed an extension with a roughly similar aim that filters based upon various phrases and characteristics rather than the poster of the comments themselves. It collapses comments (via automatic triggering of HN's built-in collapsing feature) and adds a \"reason\" tag to the comment information, so I can choose whether or not to read it anyways. I feel the features with the most positive differences are the capitalization detector (hides all caps or all lowercase) and the character requirement.reply",
      "That is very cool. It would be cool to see what you decided to filter on (other than the same-case filter and the char limit). I had a similar idea where I would run comments through a fast cheap LLM to evaluate whether they could be tagged in a certain way. I originally tried just pure word-stemming and phrase-based blocking and found that I couldn't tune it well for my uses. I also found that collapsing comments lead to my opening them out of curiosity.Thank you for sharing what works for you. I think it's great other people have been doing this style of read-side filtering. It's a pity that there's no way to inject code into mobile apps safely (i.e. this is an easy path to app-store rejection). Perhaps there's no option there but to push `shouldFilter` out to a server where you can run the logic. My use of my phone is the weakest link in my filtering strategy.reply",

      "A lot of people here are commenting that if you have to care about specific latency numbers in Python you should just use another language.I disagree. A lot of important and large codebases were grown and maintained in Python (Instagram, Dropbox, OpenAI) and it's damn useful to know how to reason your way out of a Python performance problem when you inevitably hit one without dropping out into another language, which is going to be far more complex.Python is a very useful tool, and knowing these numbers just makes you better at using the tool.\nThe author is a Python Software Foundation Fellow. They're great at using the tool.In the common case, a performance problem in Python is not the result of hitting the limit of the language but the result of sloppy un-performant code, for example unnecessarily calling a function O(10_000) times in a hot loop.I wrote up a more focused \"Python latency numbers you should know\" as a quiz here https://thundergolfer.com/computers-are-fastreply",
      "Agreed, and on top of that:I think these kind of numbers are everywhere and not just specific to Python.In zig, I sometimes take a brief look to the amount of cpu cycles of various operations to avoid the amount of cache misses. While I need to aware of the alignment and the size of the data type to debloat a data structure. If their logic applies, too bad, I should quit programming since all languages have their own latency on certain operations we should aware of.There are reasons to not use Python, but that particular reason is not the one.reply",
      "No.Python\u2019s issue is that it is incredibly slow in use cases that surprise average developers. It is incredibly slow at very basic stuff, like calling a function or accessing a dictionary.If Python didn\u2019t have such an enormous number of popular C and C++ based libraries it would not be here. It was saved by Numpy etc etc.reply",

      "I think both points are fair. Python is slow - you should avoid it if speed is critical, but sometimes you can\u2019t easily avoid it.I think the list itself is super long winded and not very informative. A lot of operations take about the same amount of time.  Does it matter that adding two ints is very slightly slower than adding two floats? (If you even believe this is true, which I don\u2019t.) No. A better summary would say \u201call of these things take about the same amount of time: simple math, function calls, etc. these things are much slower: IO.\u201d And in that form the summary is pretty obvious.reply",
      "I think the list itself is super long winded and not very informative.I agree. I have to complement the author for the effort put in. However it misses the point of the original Latency numbers every programmer should know, which is to build an intuition for making good ballpark estimations of the latency of operations and that e.g. A is two orders of magnitude more expensive than B.reply",
      "> A lot of important and large codebases were grown and maintained in PythonHow does this happen? Is it just inertia that cause people to write large systems in a essentially type free, interpreted scripting language?reply",
      "Small startups end up writing code in whatever gets things working faster, because  having too large a codebase with too much load is a champagne problem.If I told you that we were going to be running a very large payments system, with customers from startups to Amazon, you'd not write it in ruby and put the data in MongoDB, and then using its oplog as a queue... but that's what Stripe looked like. They even hired a compiler team to add type checking to the language, as that made far more sense than porting a giant monorepo to something else.reply",

In the case of food, when they do eat out, they frequent traditional, low cost/quality establishments.As for why a Big Mac costs that much, labor definitely doesn\u2019t have much to do with it. My impression is that prices continued to get pushed up as long as sales didn\u2019t take a hit, which means it\u2019s mostly pure profit.Keep in mind that the median salary isn\u2019t that high.

I wouldn\u2019t doubt if the number of buyers who don\u2019t own a record player is even higher tha 50%, and that the percentage of people who actually play the records is actually 10-20%. I don\u2019t have data on that, it\u2019s just a hunch.Many of us in the indie music industry (hip hop sustained record plants for many years, arguably until independent music started pressing in the 2000s) have mixed feelings about records. It\u2019s a lot of plastic. A lot of waste. And they\u2019re cubersome to bring on tour.But there isn\u2019t another physical medium that sells at all as well as vinyl. Soft apparel always does well. But people want vinyl.I don\u2019t love the Gen Z framing of this though. Vinyl purchasing at this point is multi generational.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s some mysterious Gen Z love of physical. I think we all know that Spotify doesn\u2019t pay artists appropriately and we want to help sustain the music we love.
