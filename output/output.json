It was a problem noted by users in a thread here just last week, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46460319While Claude Code might have been the reason this bug became triggered by more people, there are some of us who were hitting it without ever having used Claude Code at all.  Maybe the assumption about what makes a page non-standard, isn't as black-and-white as presumed.  And I wonder if the leak would have been triggered more often for people who use scrollback-limit = 0, or something very small.Probably not a huge deal, but it does seem the fix will needlessly delete and recreate non-standard pages in the case where the new page needs to be non-standard, and the oldest one (that needs to be pruned) already is non-standard and could be reused.reply",

This shouldn't change any perceived performance.And as I note in the blog post, there are alternative approaches such as the one you suggested, but we don't have enough empirical data to support changing our viewpoint on that whereas our current viewpoint (standard sizes are common) is well supported by known benchmarks.

How is this particular output insightful or helpful?

But reading thought many of the supportive comments, it seems more likely that this is an LLM Rorschach test where we are given random connections and asked to do the mental work of inventing meaning in them.I love reading.

I imagine that the casino versions of poker are not TXHT.By contrast, roulette is simply a game where the casino wins eventually with a fixed profit (thanks to 0 and a possible 00).  That is all well documented.I have only ever visited a casino once, 25 years ago, Plymouth, Devon as it turns out and I was advised to only take \u00a350 in readies and bail out when it was gone.  I came out \u00a390 up, which was nice and my \"advisor\" came out \u00a395 up (eventually, after being \u00a3200 down at one point).

      "They offer (real) poker at some casinos. It's standard NLHE usually 100-200bb max buyin, sometimes match the stack etc.Most common game spread is 9-handed $200 max $1/$2 NLHE. It's exactly like the game on the link, except more players and lower stakes.In the game, you try to win the money of the other 8 players, not of the casino. The casino takes a rake each hand, and a player with a large enough edge can overcome it. The edge might be you're excellent, or it might be they're terrible (or drunk). But the house gets paid to deal each hand.In the long term, poker outcomes are determined by skill. In the short term, they're luck. In the medium term, both. Most people never reach the long term, it's a lot of hands.There's also table games, similar to blackjack, that they call \"three card poker\" etc. These can't be beat, they favor the house.

      "Hold'em is offered in casinos routinely, I'm not sure where else one even goes to play it aside from private games, but it is not against the casino. It's against other players, and the casino takes a percentage of the pot.Others may differ and I am biased because 99% of my play has been online, but I'd say it's almost entirely playing the odds. Or at least, the popular romantic conception of looking for tells or whatever, is, I would expect, a really minimal edge compared to simply playing better.You do learn the other players' tendencies and adapt accordingly, and table selection is very important, so in that sense it is very much about reading players.A large part of my play was heads up where it's very much about understanding the other player's play as deeply as possible, and so if I wanted to be technically accurate about reading players vs playing the odds, I'd say both are very important. But if I'm answering someone who has the popular conception of what those phrases mean, I think saying \"it's about playing the odds\" would give them the more accurate picture.You really want to be good at playing the odds, and you don't want to stray too far from fundamentally good play. If someone is learning how to play and I'm advising them, I'm teaching them all about playing the odds, and trying to get them to read players less.

Fly now have a product that lets me make a simple JSON API call to run untrusted code in a new sandbox.

Poorly designed gates are the opposite of \"bat friendly\" and turn the safe entrances into buffets for raccoons.Why do we care about protecting bats?

      "Do you have any evals on how good LLMs are at generating Glyphlang?I\u2019m curious if you optimized for the ability to generate functioning code or just tokenization compression rate, which LLMs you tokenized for, and what was your optimization process like.reply",
      "I've found that short symbols cause collisions with other tokens in the llms vocabulary. It is generally much better to have long descriptive names for everything in a language than short ones.An example that shocked me was using an xml translation of C for better vector search. The lack of curly braces made the model return much more relavent code than using anything else, including enriching the database with ctags.>GlyphLang is specifically optimized for how modern LLMs tokenize.This is extremely dubious. The vocabulary of tokens isn't conserved inside model families, let alone entirely different types of models. The only thing they are all good at is tokenizing English.reply",
      "The collision point is interesting, but I'd argue context disambiguates. If I'm understanding you correctly, I don't think the models are confused about whether or not it's looking at an email when `@` appears before a route pattern. These symbols are heavily represented in programming contexts (e.g. Python decorators, shell scripts, etc.), so LLMs have seen them plenty of times in code. I'd be interested if you shared your findings though! Definitely an issue I would like to see if I could avoid or at least mitigate somewhat.That's an absolutely fair point that vocabularies differ regarding the tokenizer variance, but the symbols GlyphLang uses are ASCII characters that tokenize as single tokens across GPT4, Claude, and Gemini tokenizers. THe optimization isn't model-specific, but rather it's targeting the common case of \"ASCII char = 1 token\". I could definitely reword my post though - looking at it more closely, it does read more as \"fix-all\" rather than \"fix-most\".Regardless, I'd genuinely be interested in seeing failure cases. It would be incredibly useful data to see if there are specific patterns where symbol density hurts comprehension.reply",
      "Arguably, math notation and set theory already has everything that we need.For example see this prompt describing an app:\nhttps://textclip.sh/?ask=chatgpt#c=XZTNbts4EMfvfYqpc0kQWpsEc...reply",
      "That's an awesome tool! I think textclip.sh solves a different problem though (correct me if I'm wrong - this is the first I've been exposed to it). Compression at the URL/transport layer helps with sharing prompts, but the token count still hits you once the text is decompressed and fed into the model. The LLM sees the full uncompressed text.The approach with GlyphLang is to make the source code itself token-efficient. When an LLM reads something like `@ GET /users/:id { $ user = query(...) > user }`, that's what gets tokenized (not a decompressed version). The reduced tokenization persists throughout the context window for the entire session.That said, I don't think they're mutually exclusive. You could use textclip.sh to share GlyphLang snippets and get both benefits.reply",
      "I feel like any deviation from the syntax LLMs are trained on is not productive.Sure you can represent the same code in fewer tokens but I doubt it'll get those tokens correct as often.reply",
      "Yeah, big plus one from me. I recently tried to investigate some sort of alternative encoding to/from \u201cthe prompt,\u201d and was swiftly told that was both not possible and would work against me. As you pointed out, the LLMs are trained on language and language itself is often not terse. Trying to skirt that will cause the LLM to calculate the vectors poorly because the relation between the input tokens and its training data doesn\u2019t really exist.reply",
      "Funny, I've been noodling on something that goes the other direction - avoiding symbols as much as possible and trying to use full english words.Very underbaked but https://github.com/jaggederest/locquereply",
      "I had a conversation with Claude about what language to work in. It was a web app and it led me to Typescript mainly because of the training data for the model, plus typing and being able to write pure functions. Haskell might have been preferred except for the lower amounts of training data.reply",
      "I think there\u2019s a certain amount of novelty to this, and the aesthetic of the language I find pleasing, but I\u2019m a little confused\u2026 Admittedly, I didn\u2019t read the entire doc and only quickly glanced at the source\u2026 But is it just transpiling Golang code to and from this syntax, or is it intended to be a whole language eventually? Can folks able to just import golang packages or do they have to only use what packages are currently supported?Additionally I have two thoughts about it:1. I think this might be more practical as a transparent layer so users can write and get Golang (or whatever) the original language was back. Essentially making it something only the model reads/outputs.2.) Longer term it seems like both NVidia and AMD along with the companies training/running the models are focused on driving down cost per token because it\u2019s just too damn high. And I personally don\u2019t see a world where AI becomes pervasive without a huge drop in cost token\u2014 it\u2019s not sustainable for companies running the models and end users really can\u2019t afford the real costs as they are today. My point being, will this even be necessary in a 12-18 months?I could totally be missing things or lacking the vision of where this could go but I personally would worry that anything written with this has a very short shelf life.That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not useful in the meantime, or not a cool project, more so if there is a longer term vision for it, I think it would be worth calling out.reply"

      "This is a tangential point (this post is not really about TUIs; sort of the opposite) and I think lots of people know it already but I only figured it out last week and so can't resist sharing it: agents are good at driving tmux, and with tmux as a \"browser\", can verify TUI layouts.So you can draw layouts like this and prompt Claude or Gemini with them, and get back working versions, which to me is space alien technology.reply",
      "This is spot on, I understand very little about how terminal rendering works and was able to build github.com/agavra/tuicr (Terminal UI for Code Review) in an evening. The initial TUI design was done via Claude.reply",
      "Yeah, text was king yesterday, will be tomorrowreply",
      "Would love to hear more about this approach.reply",
      "It's actually really easy in Claude Code. Get a TUI to the point where it renders something, and get Claude to the point where it knows what you want to render (draw it in ASCII like this post proposes, for instance).Then just prompt Claude to \"use tmux to interact with and test the TUI rendering\", prompt it through anything it gets hung up on (for instance, you might remind Claude that it can create a tmux pane with fixed size, or that tmux has a capture-pane feature to dump the contents of a view). Claude already knows a bunch about tmux.Once it gets anything useful done, ask it to \"write a subagent definition for a TUI tester that uses tmux to exercise a TUI and test its rendering, layout, and interaction behavior\".Save that subagent definition, and now Claude can do closed-loop visual and interactive testing of its own TUI development.reply",
      "Can you explain tmux's contribution here? I'm confused why this process wouldn't work just the same if CC directly executed the program rather than involving tmux. Are you just using tmux to trick the program under test into running its TUI instead of operating in a dumb-stdout mode?reply",
      "It allows Claude to take screenshots and generate keyboard inputs. It's like TUI Playwright.reply",
      "So by screenshots you mean tmux capture-pane, not actual screenshots. So in essence it is using stdout, just not Claude\u2019s own.reply",
      "Maybe I'm not understanding it (totally possible!) but could Claude just do that by reading standard out and writing to standard in?reply",
      "I had a really hard time getting anything like that to work (you can't just read stdout and write stdin, because you're driving a terminal in raw mode), but it took like 3 sentences worth of Claude prompt to get Claude to use tmux to do this reliably.reply"

      "ChatGPT has made a material difference in my ability to understand health problems, test results, and to communicate with doctors effectively. My wife and I were talking last night about how helpful it was in 2025. I hope that it continues to be good at this.I want regulators to keep an eye on this and make smart laws. I don't want it to go away, as its value is massive in my life.(One example, if you are curious: I've been doing rehab for a back injury for about 10 years. I worked with a certified trainer/rehab professional for many years and built a program to keep me as pain-free as possible. I rebuilt the entire thing with ChatGPT/Gemini about 6 weeks ago, and I've had less pain than at any other point in my life. I spent at least 12 hours working with AI to test and research every exercise, and I've got some knowledge to help guide me, but I was amazed by how far it has come in 12 months. I ran the results by a trainer to double-check it was well thought out.)reply",
      "This sounds like excellent evidentiary material for a future insurer or government health provider to decide you're uninsurable, not eligible for a job, and so on.And the great thing about it is that you already signed all your rights away for them to do this exact thing, when we could have had an open world with open models run locally instead where you got to keep your private health information private.reply",
      "Can you explain the exact way in which this is possible? It\u2019s not legal to be denied jobs based on health. Not to deny insurancereply",
      "And how would you know what they base their hiring upon? You would just get a generic automated response..You would not be privy to their internal processes, and thusfar not be able to prove wrong doing. You would just have to hope for a new Snowden and that the found wrongdoings would actually be punished this time.reply",
      "This fails the classic conspiracy theory test: Any company practicing this would have to be large enough to be able to afford to orchestrate a chain of illegal transactions to get the data, develop a process for using it in hiring, and routinely act upon it.The continued secrecy of the conspiracy would then depend on every person involved in orchestrating this privacy violation and illegal hiring scheme keeping it secret forever. Nobody ever leaking it to the press, no disgruntled employees e-mailing their congress people, no concerned citizens slipping a screenshot to journalists. Both during and after their employment with the company.To even make this profitable at all, the data would have to be secretly sold to a lot of companies for this use, and also continuously updated to be relevant. Giant databases of your secret ChatGPT queries being sold continuously in volume, with all employees at both the sellers, the buyers, and the users of this information all keeping it perfectly quiet, never leaking anything.reply",
      "It doesn't though. As an aside, I have been using a competitor to chatgpt health (nori) for a while now, and I have been getting an extreme amount of targeted ads about HRV and other metrics that the app consumes. I have been collecting health metrics through wearables for years, so there has been no change in my own search patterns or beliefs about my health. I just thought ai + health data was cool.reply",
      "I don't get it, if you're medically unfit for a job, why would you want the job?For instance, if your job is to be on your feet all day and you can barely stand, then that job is not for you. I have never met employers that are so flush in opportunities of candidates that they just randomly choose to exclude certain people.And if it's insurance, there's a group rate. The difference only variable is what the employee chooses out of your selected plans (why make a plan available if you don't want people to pick that one?) and family size. It's illegal to discriminate of family size and that does add up to 10k extra on the employer side. But there are downsides to hiring young single people, so things may balance out.reply",
      "Usually there's one or two job responsibilities among many, that you can do, but not the way everyone else does them. The ADA requires employers to make reasonable accommodations, and some employers don't want to.So less, the job requires you to stand all day, and more, once a week or so they ask you make a binder of materials, and the hole puncher they want you to use dislocates your hands (true story). Or, it's a desk job, but you can't get from your desk to the bathroom in your wheelchair unless they widen the aisles between desks (hypothetical).reply",
      "I believe existing laws carve out exceptions for medical fitness for certain positions for this very reason. If I may, stepping back for a second: the reason privacy laws exist, is to protect people from bad behavior from employers, health insurance, etc.If we circumvent those privacy laws, through user licenses, or new technology - we are removing the protections of normal citizens. Therefore, the bad behavior which we already decided as a society to ban can now be perpetrated again, with perhaps a fresh new word for it to dodge said old laws.If I understand your comment, you are essentially wondering why those old laws existed in the first place. I would suggest racism or other systemic issues, and differences in insurance premiums, are more than enough to justify the existence of privacy laws. Take a normal office job as an example over a manual labor intensive job. No reason at all that health conditions should impact that. The idea of not being hired because I have a young child, or a health condition, that would raise the group rate from the insurer passing the cost to my employer (which would be in their best interest to do) is a terrible thought. And it happened before, and we banned that practice (or did our best to do so).All this to say, I believe HIPAA helps people, and if ChatGPT is being used to partially or fully facilitate medical decision making, they should be bound under strict laws preventing the release of that data regardless of their existing user agreements.reply",

The answer is buried in the announcement, obscured by an excessive amount of privacy theatre.What struck me most about OpenAI\u2019s blog post is how much effort they put into reassuring users about privacy. They go out of their way to explain that the experience is private, that it\u2019s secure, that they\u2019ve gone above and beyond industry standards. The message between the lines is clear: don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re safe, we have your back.This is a strange message coming from OpenAI. Their track record on privacy has been abysmal. On the free tier of ChatGPT, there is no privacy by default. Even on the paid Plus and Pro plans, you don\u2019t get privacy by default. You can opt in to chat history privacy, but that\u2019s just one aspect of it. Actual privacy is listed as a selling point for the Enterprise plan. It\u2019s what you pay extra for.So wh"

For Windows, it feels like ads for their partners and ensuring they don't fumble the ai/agent transition the way they did with mobile.Linux is SUCH a breath of fresh air.

Outside of a tiling window manager like Sway or i3, I actually have found it more keyboard-centric than any other desktop I've used.The reason I am harping on keyboard is because to me the keyboard is the signature differentiator between \"desktop\" and \"tablet\".I feel like everyone hated on Gnome because it was different. They tried it for ten minutes, didn't bother trying to actually learn how to use it, declared it as \"shit\", and moved on.
