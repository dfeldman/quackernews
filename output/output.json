      "I started using <dialog> in 2019, even though Firefox and Safari wouldn't support it for another couple of years, but Google's own Polyfill (of which I am a very modest contributor) was top-notch quality and so I had no problems using it in production for my LoB SaaS day-job.But my biggest let-down with the <dialog> element is that it's comnpletely unstyled, beyond a very basic (and very un-Chrome-like) thick black line pixel border with sharp edges. Whereas my-hope-and-expectation (and indeed: what got me interested in <dialog> in the first place) was that I was hoping that the browser itself would provide for a lot of the tedium involved in UI dialog dev-work in-general, especially for things like automaticallyt conforming to the host OS' conventions on dialog/window layout and placement: I was hoping that I could mark-up an actual semantic model of a dialog and the browser would do the hard-work of making it look like a real native macOS (or iOS) - or Windows - dialog resource.I was also hoping that, because open <dialog> elements exist in a distinct top-level layer, that they might even able to escape the bounds of the browser viewport, which would provide real value to the end-user in a lot of places (e.g. no-one wants an unmovable popup or modal-dialog that completely obscures the user's view of an underlying document (like macOS's old \"Sheets\" dialogs) - so another false-hope of mine got popped that day.-----I get the feeling that browser vendors would all like to see us stop using `alert()`, `prompt()` and `confirm()` in JavaScript (because they block the JS/main thred), but the same browser-vendors really haven't come-up with an adequate replacement: the beeauty of alert/prompt/confirm is that their API is incredibly simple yet effective and also doesn't require the proggrammer to have any UI design-skills; I don't understand why browsers still don't offer a non-blocking Promie-based API for alert/prompt/confirm instead of them trying, in vain, to convince us that <dialog> is better in every situastion when it clearly isn't.\n]\n \nreply",
      "Premade ways of escaping the bounds of a browser viewport with styling like a system dialog box certainly sounds like something a developer would want rather than users or browser makers. It's not an accidental disappointment new things aren't made to function like alert() and friends used to, it also has upsides (beyond just \"the old interface was not promise based\".I do agree <dialog> could have done with at least a little bit of TLC on the styling though, I just don't think it has to be 100% look and function like a system dialog outside the DOM to do it. Some base default styling to match the rest of the browser's default style would do wonders.For PWAs (or any \"web apps with more permissions than a random page should get just for being loaded\") I could see where you wanted <dialogs> to go as a more well received idea though, similar to how there are separate things for styling the windows and interacting with the system for those more privileged pages.\n \nreply",
      "> is that it's comnpletely unstyledAnother reason might be that vendor making it look like a native browser window would blur the line of death[1]. It would make it easier for malicious website to make a popup \"browser update\" in the middle of the page that redirects to seemingly legit Chrome download page and downloads modified executable.[1]: https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/\n \nreply",
      "> comnpletely unstyled,this is what completely holds back most built-in browser components from widespread usage, i suspect the vendors implementing it just don't care at all because it's not their problemevery company i've ever worked at had at least a somewhat consistently defined design language and it would look completely amateurish and out of place to use built in browser components in most places, regardless of how much html/css purists want that to be the caseunless that is fixed, it will never happen\n \nreply",
      "I think you might be talking about a different thing to the other poster.The dialog element behaves exactly how you'd want it to behave for a company with their own design language \u2014 you can style every part of it exactly how you need it (including the backdrop, the positioning and size of the dialog element itself, borders, colours, contents, etc).  Depending on how you implement the design language, you can either apply those styles to the dialog element in general, or provide a custom component that wraps the dialog element and provides the styles you need.What the previous poster was complaining about was the opposite situation: they aren't working with their own design language, and instead want to use native-looking HTML elements (the default inputs, selects, buttons, etc).  However, the dialog element does not provide a native look-and-feel, and instead is very minimalistic, providing only the base that developers can add their own styles to.That said, I think the browser implementors have made the correct choice here.  The dialog element is not a native popup, and doesn't behave like a native popup at all, so it doesn't make sense to style it natively.  In addition, the more styles they provide as part of the user-agent styling, the harder it is to reset those styles if you want to do something different.  Apart from inputs, browsers fairly consistently stick with providing the minimum possible styling for an element to be usable, and this means that developers have the largest range of freedom to use those elements as they like.\n \nreply",
      "I feel like every company's (different/contrasting) \"design language\" and their insistence on using it, ends up being yet another weird looking thing on my computer. I'd rather decide for myself the fonts, color scheme, look and feel, etc. for applications on my computer, and have applications be consistent and respect those preferences.

      "> In 2009, a surprising amount of the discourse was focused on the algorithms git used to automatically merge changes together.IIRC Torvalds himself was quite pessimistic about what could be achieved with automatic merging. (And in this he was correct.) He said that Git had rejected the idea that a version-control system could, or should attempt to, \"solve the merging problem\" by finding a sufficiently-smart algorithm which would do the right things automatically.> Offline editing is a UI/UX problemTrue. There are two deeper root causes here:1) computing's commitment to cargo-culting old solutions and, relatedly,2) its devotion to the belief \"in general 5-lb sacks are nicer to deal with than 10-lb sacks: therefore I should fit my 10 lbs of POL into one 5-lb sack\".The default vision of \"text editor\" is \"Mosaic textarea\", \"MacWrite\" or something in between, so the quest is usually to bolt merging onto something like that with the minimum possible change. Make it a menu item, or a little dialog box with a few options. If there is some kind of GUI support for merging hidden deep in the menus it's a programmer-UI diff-merger horror that barely does the minimum, or a strikethrough-based view which feels treacherous like navigating a ship through a fog. But in fact in text editing with offline collaboration merging, partly-manual merging at that, is a central part of the process and it needs to be central to the design of the editor. Unfortunately MacWrite is a local maximum which isn't easy to get far away from.\n \nreply",
      "Hi! Author of Eg-walker & ShareJS here, both of which are referenced by this post.You write this article like you're disagreeing with me - but I agree completely with what you've said. I've been saying so on HN for years. (Eg, in this comment from 6 years ago[1].)The way I think about it, the realtime collaborative tools we use today make a lot of sense when everyone is online & editing together. But when users edit content offline, or in long lived branches, you probably want the option to add conflict markers & do manual review when merging. (Especially for code.)Luckily, algorithms like egwalker have access to all the information they need to do that. We store character-by-character editing traces from all users. And we store when all changes happened (in causal order, like a git DAG). This is far more information than git has. So it should be very possible to build a CRDT which uses this information to detects & mark conflict ranges when branches are merged. Then we can allow users to manually resolve conflicts.Algorithmically, this is an interesting problem but it should be quite solvable. Just, for some reason, nobody has worked on this yet. So, thanks for writing this post and bringing more attention to this problem!If anyone is interested in making a unique and valuable contribution to the field, I'd love to see some work on this. Its an important piece thats missing in the CRDT ecosystem - simply because (as far as I know) nobody has tried to solve it yet. At least not for text editing.[1] Bottom part of this comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19889174\n \nreply",
      "Mechanical merge algorithms can perform better or worse on different kinds of conflicts (the specific example of editing deleted text is just one of many edge cases) but in the end no CRDT can decide if your merged text is what you mean to say.We go into a bunch more detail in the Upwelling paper about the differences between (what we call) semantic and syntactic conflicts in writing: https://inkandswitch.com/upwelling/Ultimately, my feeling is that serious collaboration is a document review problem as much as anything else. That said, this is particularly true in journalism and scientific publishing and can be mostly ignored for your meeting notes...Anyway, if you see this comment, thanks for a nice piece of writing, Alex. Love to see folks wrestling with these problems.\n \nreply",

      "I think this happens because the mathematical, or causal, or entropic, notion of conflicts has been conflated with semantic conflicts. In the past I have made the same mistake, though inversely and was adamantly informed that I had no clue what I was talking about :)Things get way nastier when you start considering trees, e.g. yJS operates on JSON documents. From a UI standpoint (where the UI is showing some shallow level and hasn't been expanded to the deeper level) users could never even see edits that have been deleted.I think that the class of CRDTs that preserve conflicts (IIRC that is when a register can hold multiple values) hold the most promise. Users should then be presented with those conflicts - and it could even be completely visual. Being able to scrub through history also seems like a viable alternative (allowing the user to figure out how a strange thing happened, or how their changes disappeared).\n \nreply",

      "For all things Git is good at, conflict resolution is most definitely not one of them. There are many ways to slice a conflicting diff into plus and minus parts, and somehow Git usually manages to create conflicts that are the least human readable.

There are many tools out there which do a considerably better job at this, for example by diffing the AST, not the text representation.\n \nreply",

      "Not the person you asked, but I will take a shot at your question. The best python package for getting what you want out of these systems is to use original gangster python with libraries to help with your goals.For your example; Write a python script with requests that hits the OpenAI API. You can even hardcode the API key because its just a script on your computer! Now you have the GPT-4proLight-mini-deluxe response in JSON. You can pipe that into a bazzillion and one different places including another API request to Anthropic. Once that returns, you can now have TWO llm responses to analyze.I tried haystack, langchain, txtai, langroid, CrewAI, Autogen, and more that I am forgetting. One day while I was reading r/Localllama someone wrote; \"All these packages are TRASH, just write python!\"... Lightbulb moment for me. Duh!

I tell you that has been massive for my usage of these LLM's outside of the chat interfaces like LibreChat and OpenWebUI. You can even have claude or deepseek write the script for you.

Their chargers are much better maintained in general than the infamous Electrify America (they really struggle to fix EA chargers when they have problems, and they have problems) - there's a long story behind this.Rivian started before the plan to use superchargers was even envisioned, so today some of those holes that Rivian was filling aren't so important because tesla superchargers are nearby.Rivian has done a great job keeping their chargers working, have the software be reliable, just running a good service. Many and maybe most DCFC charger networks (DCFC meaning high power CCS chargers not including Tesla superchargers) really have struggled to match the uptime and reliability tesla SC. Tesla's magic ability it: (1) fix them when they break, quickly.  (2) don't just build 4 chargers in a spot, it's almost the same cost to build 8 or 10.  (3) string them together along main travel routes to make it possible to travel.The entire rest of the the charging industry basically fails at those 3 things. Most of them can't manage to fix a broken charger, sometimes in months. One major reason is they often don't have standardized hardware so there might not be a spare hardware to fix something there.\n \nreply",

This will be true even if the stations themselves see ~15% utilization.But break two of them? Yeah, there might be an occasional line, but your fee drops to $5k and you still produce the same revenue.

      "Author here -- six months ago we launched ARC Prize, a huge $1M experiment, to test if we need new ideas for AGI. The ARC-AGI benchmark remains unbeaten and I think we can now definitely say \"yes\".One big update since June is that progress is no longer stalled. Coming into 2024, the public consensus vibe was that pure deep learning / LLMs would continue scaling to AGI. The fundamental architecture of these systems hasn't changed since ~2019.But this flipped late summer. AlphaProof and o1 are evidence of this new reality. All frontier AI systems are now incorporating components beyond pure deep learning like program synthesis and program search.I believe ARC Prize played a role here too. All the winners this year are leveraging new AGI reasoning approaches like deep-learning guided program synthesis, and test-time training/fine-tuning. We'll be seeing a lot more of these in frontier AI systems in coming years.And I'm proud to say that all the code and papers from this year's winners are now open source!We're going to keep running this thing annually until its defeated. And we've got ARC-AGI-2 in the works to improve on several of the v1 flaws (more here: https://arcprize.org/blog/arc-prize-2024-winners-technical-r...)The ARC-AGI community keeps surprising me. From initial launch, through o1 testing, to the final 48 hours when the winning team jumped 10% and both winning papers dropped out of nowhere. I'm incredibly grateful to everyone and we will do our best to steward this attention towards AGI.We'll be back in 2025!\n \nreply",
      "As a rather experienced ML researcher, ARC is a great benchmark on its own, but is punching below its weight in terms of claiming that it is a gate (or in terms of this post -- a \"steward\") towards AGI, and in my perspective and the perspective of several researchers near me this has watered down the value of the ARC benchmark as a test.It is a great unit test for reasoning -- that's fantastic! And maybe it is indeed the best way to test for this -- who knows  exactly. But the claim is a little grandiose for what it is, this is somewhat similar to saying that testing on string parity is the One True Test for testing an optimizer's efficiency.I'd heartily recommend maybe taking down the marketing vibrance down a notch and keep things a bit more measured, it's not entirely a meme, though some of the more-serious researchers don't take it as seriously as a result. And that's the kind of people that you want to attract to this sort of thing!I think there is a potentially good future for ARC! But it might struggle to attract some of the kind of talent that you want to work on this problem as a result.\n \nreply",
      "> I'd heartily recommend maybe taking down the marketing vibrance down a notch and keep things a bit more measured, it's not entirely a meme, though some of the more-serious researchers don't take it as seriously as a result.This is fair critique. ARC Prize's 2024 messaging was sharp to break through the noise floor -- ARC has been around since 2019 but most only learned about it this summer. Now that it has garnered awareness, it is no longer useful, and in same cases hurting progress like you point out. The messaging needs to evolve and mature next year to be more neutral/academic.\n \nreply",
      "I feel rather consternated that this response effectively boils down to \"yes, we know we overhyped this to get people's attention, and now that we have it we can be more honest about it\". Fighting for place in the attention economy is understandable, being deceptive about it is not.This is part of the ethical morass of why some more serious researchers aren't touching the benchmark. People are not going to take it seriously if it continues like this!\n \nreply",
      "I think we agree; to clarify, sharp messaging isn't inaccurate messaging. And I believe the story is not overhyped given the evidence: the benchmark resisted a $1M prize pool for ~6 months. But I concede we did obsess about the story to give it the best chance of survival in the marketplace of ideas against the incumbent AI research meme (LLM scaling). Now that the AI research field is coming around to the idea that something beyond deep learning is needed, the story matters less, and the benchmark, and future versions, can stand on their utility as a compass towards AGI.\n \nreply",
      "Mike - please know that not everyone who appreciates ARC feels the same way as the GP. I'm not an academic researcher but I am quite sensitive to hype and excessive marketing. I've never felt the ARC site was anything other than appropriately professional.Even revisiting it now, I don't see anything wrong with being concisely clear and even a little provocative in stating your case on your own site. Especially since a key value of ARC is getting more objectively grounded regarding progress toward AGI. On top of that ARC is \"A non-profit for the public advancement of open artificial general intelligence\" that you guys are personally donating serious money and time to that's helping a field where a lot of entrepreneurs are going to make money and academics are going to advance their careers.My perception is ARC tried it the other way for years but a lot of academics and AI pundits ignored or dismissed it without ever meaningfully engaging with it. \"Sharpening\" the message this year has clearly paid off in bringing attention that's shifted the conversation and is helping advance progress toward AGI in ways nothing else has. I also greatly appreciate the time and care you and Francois have put into making the ARC proposition clear enough for non-technical people to understand. That's hard to do and doesn't happen by accident.Personally, I've found ARC valuable in the real world outside of academia and domain experts because it provides a conceptually simple starting place to discuss with non-technical people what the term AGI might even mean. My high school-aged daughter asked me about vague AGI impending doom scenarios she heard on TikTok. I had her solve a couple ARC samples and then pointed out that today's best AIs aren't yet close to doing the same. This counter-intuitive revelation got her pondering the \"Why?\" which led to a deep discussion about the multi-dimensional breadth of human creativity and an appreciation of the many ways artificial intelligences might differ from human intelligence.\n \nreply",
      "> Now that the AI research field is coming around to the idea that something beyond deep learning is needed,I have not heard this from anyone that I work with! It would be a curious violation of info theory were this to be the case.Certainly, some things cannot efficiently be learned from data. This is a case where some other kind of inductive bias or prior is needed (again, from info theory) -- but replacing deep learning entirely would be rather silly.Part of the reason that a number of researchers don't take the benchmark more seriously is because it's meant to cripple the results. For example, in the name of reducing brute force search, the compute was severely limited! This turned many off to begin with. The general contention as I understand was to let compute be a reasonable amount, but this would not play well with the numbers game. Because if you restrict compute beyond a reasonable point, it makes the numbers artificially low for people who don't know what's going on behind the scenes. And this ends up biasing the results unreasonably to favor the original messaging, (i.e., \"We need something other than deep learning.\")If it was structured with a reasonable amount of compute, and instead, time-accuracy gates were used for prizes, it would be much more open. But people do not use it because the game is rigged to begin with!Unfortunately due to that, plus the consistent goal-post moving of the benchmark is why it's generally not really held with staying power in the research community -- the messaging changes based upon what is convenient for publicity, and there's unfortunately been a history of similar things in the past in the pedigree leading up to the ARC prize itself.It is not entirely unsalvageable, but there really needs to be a turnaround of how the competition and prize is managed in order to win back people's trust. Placing a thumb on the scales to confirm a prior bias/previous messaging may work for a little while, but over time it robs the metric of its usability over time as the greater research community loses trust.\n \nreply",

W.r.t. misquoting, they did say that we needed something \"beyond\" deep learning, not \"other than\" here, and that is on me.The utility is certainly still present, if I feel diminished, and it probably is a case of my own frustrations due to previous similar issues leading up to the ARC prize.That being said, I do agree in retrospect that my response skewed from being objective -- it is a benchmark with a mixed history, but that doesn't mean that I should get personally caught up in it.\n \nreply",

      "This misses the single biggest mistake every new manager makes: avoiding hard conversations with your reports. If you start managing folks you were recently in the trenches with this can be VERY hard. These are your comrades after all! You want them to like you. It\u2019s all very natural. Sadly it is the single biggest cause for dissatisfaction I\u2019ve seen on a given team. Being unwilling to give honest, direct feedback results in underperforming teams and unhappy reports. It\u2019s counterintuitive but very important to get right as a manager. The big \u201cAHA!!\u201d moment for me was when I realized you need to speak to behaviors and outcomes not character. So instead of \u201cyou\u2019re sloppy\u201d you say something like \u201cI\u2019ve noticed quality issues in your code recently that\u2019s resulted in some rollbacks. Can we talk about how we can address that?\u201d. Involving them in the solution and explaining why it matters. It makes all the difference and folks ironically respect and like you more for it.\n \nreply",
      "I got the impression that when he says \"couple of years\" he's talking about the low-end of the word couple. The other thing in the article that jumps out is the conclusion where he says that a team that is shipping and happy is enough to be crushing it.That isn't really enough in my experience. There are 3 questions - is the team happy? Are they shipping? Is what they are shipping valuable? - and I've seen a lot of new managers are so overwhelmed that they forget about number 3 and a fair chunk of people end up unemployed because sooner or later the bean counters figure out that the team isn't actually productive.This article, overall, doesn't identify achieving excellent outcomes as something he got wrong at first. I suspect either he is a natural manager or it is a mistake that is still being made. Probably the latter based on the other mistakes identified. The journey I've seen usually goes from lost -> controlling external perceptions of success -> oh I need to actually succeed and it isn't what I thought.\n \nreply",
      "I have found that company culture has the biggest impact on junior managers. It sets the expectation for them the most because they don\u2019t have any actual ability yet.Overly empathetic companies end up with terrible junior managers because they can\u2019t have any real direct conversations. Tough and demanding companies I have seen fair much better because no one can hide from tough conversations for too long.\n \nreply",
      "100% agree with this. I would say that the other highly likely mistake new managers make is trying to code their way out of problems. It makes sense, right? Previously when you're an IC and a project ran into issues you could just \"code harder\" and get through it, but that's rarely the right solution when you're a manager and will likely exacerbate the problem itself if you disappear into the trenches trying to code your way through a critical path. Your role is no longer primarily solving coding problems it's solving people problems.\n \nreply",
      "Completely agree. This is excellent advice.\n \nreply",
      "I agree with the sentiment and importance of addressing these things, or dealing with conflicts in-general, but I disagree with the tone somewhat and disagree with the notion that you're not in the trenches with them, but it depends on what trenches means to whoever it's relevant to. I feel like many new managers know they'll need to deal with this, but never developed their abilities prior to being a manager, and don't realize that just because the conversation happens, doesn't mean it produces valuable outcomes, breeds respect, or means anyone will like the way you approached it, or even that you were as vulnerable or honest as you thought you were.Every manager I've had that used your example quote\u2014almost verbatim\u2014went on to be incredibly passive-aggressive, because they're trying too hard not to actually create conflict, they want to be liked more than they care about the result, they don't have that much innate confidence, or like the author of the article suggested, they want to see the results they would have produced when they were an IC, and haven't yet learned how to guide autonomy and relinquish a certain amount of control. These are perhaps the traits that led them to keeping their IC job all those years.These people would turn 1-on-1s into 45 mins of beating around the bush, trying to get me to reveal myself as having insufficiently met the unspoken criteria they've been having internal anxiety attacks about, and maybe in the last few minutes when there's no room left for pushback they'd conjure the answer they wanted to hear and set that as the benchmark.This failure on their part predictibly bled into other interactions and created toxicity and resentment, they couldn't yield control, and they couldn't have a real discussion that involved more than themselves manifesting as their overbearing mother waiting for their kid to implicate themselves for some petty wrongdoing. They couldn't clearly communicate priorities, or timelines, or requirements, and were starting in their new job with a skill issue of their own. They hadn't adapted to the role or developed a good personality for it, and apparently lacked an ability to reflect on their behavior or communication style.I don't mean to extrapolate too far from this or in-turn attack you in any way, it's just a small quote, but in the past it's been telling.\"Can we talk about code quality issues\" doesn't just avoid a character trait, which I agree should should never be the target, it leans into vague, soft, meek, intentionally indirect language that just creates undue anxiety and establishes an ambiguous context for whatever the problem might be, and was a dishonest pretext for for downstream attribution of fault, since they couldn't accept the possibility that the problem might be upstream (which it wasn't always, but if it had been, they weren't going to address it then). In these situations, sometimes I was struggling with purely my own productivity, having a bad couple weeks, but otherwise it was some other issue they weren't willing or able to genuinely help me with.Do your best to be humble, learn to delegate and try to trust people, avoid thinking about character traits but don't avoid direct (and clear) language, and accept that your perception might be inaccurate. Get as far away as necessary from the dreaded \"just checking in\" or \"is there anything we can do to improve (your problem)\" as possible. What if their code is suffering because of noise in the office or someone's depressed because they're having relationship issues? What if it's because you keep coming over to their desk unannounced and asking diverting their attention?If you can do that, you're on a good track.Edit: it's worth noting that the underlying assumption in all of my comment is that people and their reasons and issues are often different, and likewise how they respond to this language may be different, and as such many might actually love the quoted phrases because they aren't imposing, and a good manager will do their best to communicate with people in a way that accepts that a variety of ways to address conflict is the right move, and sometimes less imposing language is viable.\n \nreply",
      "Most of these are pretty accurate, but there's good news: giving a sh!t about your people will likely get you 80% of the way to being a good manager. If you genuinely care about them, their work and progression you're already aligned with the key aspects. You can learn & figure out the rest. It might be hard and very unpleasant at times, and stressful, but building the teams that build software is the most rewarding accomplishment of my life.I will add one too: sometimes you only find out you don't want to be a manager after trying it. Building a lead mentorship program where both management and the individual can live a realistic experience of being a people leader is invaluable. I've implemented this program twice now and it has been great for building leadership capacity with people who are excited to take this path.\n \nreply",
      "I joined a new team as a manager and after 3 years was kindly asked to step down and become an IC. While there are many external factors to blame, I decided to do an honest postmortem with myself so I thought about these things a lot.As a line manager a huge mistake you could make (especially if you\u2019re joining a new team) is not being technical enough.You may not write code anymore, but you are expected to know the system very thoroughly, otherwise you\u2019ll be perceived as a glorified babysitter.As a new manager it\u2019s very easy to fall into the trap of not doing any technical work because you\u2019re a big boy now playing in the big boy league, but this will 100% hurt you.You need to stay on top of everything your reports are doing. Give them their space but always ask hard questions and dig deep.Frame it like this: if this report were to quit today, are you able to step in and complete their project? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s something a manager is supposed to do, but that ultimately YOU are directly responsible for your reports\u2019 work so you should be extremely familiar with it.\n \nreply",
      "I've entered 2 new orgs as an engineering manager, after getting some experience organically. You need to prioritize between lots of things, including technical / people. Usually people is the right choice I've concluded, but the first time my teams were using all new tech for me and I really struggled after over focusing on relationships. The second time I still focused more on people but new the tech better, and forced myself to find time to go through more typical developer onboarding. It was way more successful.Some of the things you mention sound right for a team lead (i.e. single team) but not really for an EM where you might have 2+ teams. You need to be able to solve the problems the leaving teammates create for you, but stepping into the role is probably the last thing you should do. Don't get me wrong, you need to live the life to build credibility and empathy, but doing the job yourself is usually a substandard, unsustainable solution.\n \nreply",
      "Having full knowledge of the work is not the same thing as full knowledge of the system. Being able to step in to do the work of one of your people is one possible way to provide a safety net for the bus factor, yes. But not the only way, and I'd argue it is not the best way.This is your team - you are managing them, not the other way around, so if they have expectations of you that are incorrect, then fix those expectations. If you are not technical, tell them so. Communicate your needs and expectations, and then let them do the work. If there is a bus factor that is too high of a risk for a sustainable team, cross-train the team to remove the bus factor. Have a sense of the priority of all the work so that if someone quits, you can re-arrange the schedule, not be forced to jump in and put out a fire.At the same time, be building up your people so that they can jump in and replace you. After all, if you cannot be replaced, you cannot be promoted either. Don't pigeon-hole yourself into a front-line manager role unless you truly love it. Grow your team, but grow yourself at the same time.\n \nreply"

That\u2019s why I want to share these insights with you. My goal is to support and connect with other new managers who are going through this exciting yet demanding transition.The most common trap you\u2019ll probably fall into is the (many times, subconscious) reluctance to delegate.

      "There's a lot of people summarizing this whole situation as \"the candidate who should have won didn't so they cancelled the election\". I'm Romanian and I'll provide some more details on this:The country has been a powder keg ever since the results of first round of the presidential elections, with Calin Georgescu coming out of nowhere to win the first round, with classical polling showing him below 5%.The candidates need to report spending to a state organization overseeing elections and this guy reported that he spent nothing on his election campaign, which is impossible as there have been flyers with his face on them, plus ads on social media. This is against the law.There are also a lot of TikTok influencers that have come forward claiming to have received payments through a third party company to present the candidate in a positive light, and the issue is that these videos should have been tagged correctly as \"electoral ads\" according to Romanian law, which did not happen.With TikTok being owned by China and their imminent ban looming in the US, there is strong suspicion that state actors are behind this, pushing Calin Georgescu through the algorithm, though this is tricky to prove.This is not a strong grass-roots movement supporting this guy, it was a targeted effort of massive network of bots spamming his name & tiktok page on random videos on Romanian tiktok videos to push his popularity (this comes from the Romanian equivalent of CIA & other security structures). Tiktok themselves when asked to comment have investigated themselves and found nothing wrong, though they do agree that there are bots on their network and they've removed millions of fake likes & followers in Romania.In a video posted this summer, Calin Georgescu expressed anti-NATO sentiment which he recanted after winning the first round of the elections. He has also previously declared that we could do with some \"russian wisdom\" and he's a big fan of the Iron Guard (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Guard), which killed a bunch of political figures in Romania during their time. This organization as well as other fascist groups are illegal in Romania.Candidates have to declare their assets as part of transparency and it seems Calin Georgescu has not declared all of his assets, which is illegal. There's also suspicions about money laundering, with a house he bought for 250K in 2006 and sold for 1M in 2011 which is unusual. This is somewhat besides the current discussion, just adding some context that this guy is not exactly squeaky clean.A criminal investigation has been requested by The Supreme Council of National Defence, which is the autonomous administrative authority in Romania invested by the Constitution with the task of organising and coordinating, by unanimous decisions, the activities related to the country's defence and national security. This is right now in the first stages with no single person being put under indictment.\n \nreply",

He got 23% of the vote which is a lot but in no way does it guarantee that he could ever come close to 50% in the second round. He only won because the non pro-Russian (i.e. pro-fascist) parties aren't actually united.\n \nreply",

      "Donald Knuth wrote 4 textbooks in assembly language with advice about why decrement then jump saves 1 assembly instruction per loop iteration.The fact that everyone uses his premature optimization is the root of evil remark is hilarious to me. The level of optimization in Knuths writing makes it evident that upfront efficiency effort is worthwhile. Just don't overdo it.But don't trust me on that quote. Just open book 3 (chapter 5 and 6, sorting and searching) and go read the tape drive simulations of merge sort yourself. You can't miss the printouts, they're huge.\n \nreply",
      "Those sound to me like the very definition of optimizations that are not premature though. His goal was to teach foundational elements of running programs on computers. Loops and sorts are used all over the place and improvements scale with inputs. I see a pretty big difference between solving for a problem you don't yet understand (the way I've always mentally framed \"premature optimization\") and establishing reasons for implementing primitives in optimal ways.\n \nreply",

You would rewrite and itterate over possible ways to rewrite. Sometimes you would see the light, other times you would try different approches brute force. The point where optimization was nesasary was completely obvious and 99% of modern code never needs the consideration.If communism takes over the world and be given 30 years half the texts wouldnt make sense as it talks about something to do with capitalism? that doesnt exist.\n \nreply",
      "I mean...  Maybe?  I guarantee that if you do any of the things he discusses in code that is getting reviewed in any company I have ever seen, you will get shot down for premature optimizations.Just look into Gosper's hack someday and tell me that that would pass most reviews?

A fuller quotation of the surrounding context gives a rounder view:I am sorry to say that many people nowadays are condemning program efficiency, telling us that it is in bad taste. The reason for this is that we are now experiencing a reaction from the time when efficiency was the only reputable criterion of goodness, and programmers in the past have tended to be so preoccupied with efficiency that they have produced needlessly complicated code; the result of this unnecessary complexity has been that net efficiency has gone down, due to difficulties of debugging and maintenance. The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming. A lot has been written about this topic a"
