      "One other very cool thing here is that this new treatment represents a whole new family of drugs (very sophisticated at that, per Derek Lowe's assessment). I thought back in the late 2010s with integrase inhibitors (e.g. dolutegravir), there was a real chance they could achieve the 90-95% reduction targets in new cases, and hopefully this new drug makes that even more feasible.There's always the risk of losing previously effective drugs due to resistance, so the value of redundancy cannot be overstated\n \nreply",

Before watching the video \nthe notion of interfering with the capsid as a mechanism for stopping the virus made sense.However, what I still don't have a handle on is how does lenacapavir act so long that it only needs to be administered every six months?From the explanation lenacapavir works on the capsid directly, it's not acting on the immune system by training the body's defences as with a traditional vaccine.

      "> The more interesting thing about the habibi key is that the public key modulus only has a 4 byte difference compared to the Microsoft RSA public key. For reference the MS key is a 2048 bit RSA key. I\u2019ve asked a few people how this might be possible and the answer I got is \u201cif you change the exponent to something small like 3 you easily factor out a similar key\u201d. This should require that the exponent of the public key is also patched to \u201c3\u201d. However, none of the shell code payloads that use the habibi key ever change the exponent used by the RSA signature verification routine. Presumably it\u2019s still performing the validation using the exponent 65537 so I\u2019m not entirely sure how this works. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable could shed some light on it.A random 2048-bit integer has a moderate chance of being trivially factorizeable (I don't know the precise odds but we can infer that it's roughly on the order of 2^-32 (for some definition of trivial) without doing any real math). Presumably, they wrote code that did something like this:    while true:\n        randomly tweak/increment 4 bytes of the public modulus \n        spend 1 millisecond trying to factor it\n        did it work? if yes, we're done here.\n        else, try again.\n\nThe resulting public modulus likely has lots of smaller factors (it should be possible to verify this, if anyone knows where I can find the \"habibi public key\"?). Although an RSA modulus normally has exactly 2 prime factors, the math still works out if you have more (as long as e is coprime).\n \nreply",
      "Let me try to explain that. You start with a random 2048-bit integer. You then change the lower bytes to make it divisible by 3. This is easy because you're only working on the public key. Now that the public key is divisible by 3, you use Fermat's little theorem which tells you that the private key must be divisible by 3 and have a sum of digits that is divisible by 3. This lets you skip most possible private keys, thereby reducing the compute needed to factorize it by a few orders of magnitude. And maybe you get lucky and they use that RSA implementation which uses exactly 2 prime factors, because then you already know that one of them is 3 and you just divide the public key by 3 to get the other prime factor.EDIT: Wikipedia says \"The structure of the RSA public key requires that N be a large semiprime (i.e., a product of two large prime numbers), that 2 < e < N, that e be coprime to \u03c6(N), and that 0 \u2264 C < N.\" and later \"the same algorithm allows anyone who factors N to obtain the private key.\"which in the contest of the Xbox hack means that if you force N to be divisible by the prime 3, then the other prime which is used for generating the private key has to be N/3 => You have successfully factored it.EDIT2: Here's code for signing with the Habibi key: https://github.com/XboxDev/xbedump/blob/b8cd5cd0f8b1cbc4e64f...As you can see, it'll replace the last 4 bytes with 0x89, 0x9c, 0x90, 0x6b and then start by dividing it by 3 and using that to generate a suitable private key.\n \nreply",
      "Ah, thanks for finding that code.Here's the original public modulus as an integer: http://factordb.com/index.php?query=207401193272587237602760...

      "What I very dislike about current browser automation tools is that they all use TCP for connecting the browser with the manager program. This means that, unlike for UNIX domain sockets, filesystem permissions (user/group restrictions) cannot be used to protect the TCP socket, which opens the browser automation ecosystem to many attacks where 127.0.0.1 cannot be trusted (untrusted users on a shared host).I have yet to see a browser automation tool that does not use localhost bound TCP sockets. Apart from that, most tools do not offer strong authentication -- a browser is spawned and it listens on a socket and when the controlling application connects to the browser management socket, no authentication is required by default, which creates hidden vulnerabilites.While browser sessions may only be controlled by knowing their random UUIDs, creating new sessions is usually possible to anyone on 127.0.0.1.I don't know really, it's quite possible I'm just spreading lies here, please correct me and expand on this topic a bit.\n \nreply",

The sad thing is that it's so much easier to create a Chromium-based browser than it is to create a Gecko based one.

They are a distillation of every semantic element on the page, which makes them fantastic for snapshot \u201ctests\u201d or BDD tests.My dream would be these accessibility trees one day become standardized across the major browser engines.

      "I\u2019ve built quite a few french drains in residential settings, some lasting longer than others - I\u2019ll share a few hard earned lessons here:Soil migration is the number one failure mode. This is mentioned but perhaps a bit understated in the video.To prevent soil migration you absolutely need commercial grade geotextile fabric wrapping the gravel and pipe.You can buy pipe with much bigger and more numerous holes than the tiny slits depicted in the video. That also obviates the need to decide what orientation the holes should be.Void space is the most critical factor when choosing gravel. You need a lot of space between the rocks to support fast drainage. Do not use playground pebbles or anything similar. Pay close attention to the type of aggregate you\u2019re buying.Calculate how much water you actually need to drain. You can use the \u201c100 year flood\u201d values for your locale to get an upper bound on rainfall, then multiple by drainage area. This is especially important if your roof is part of the watershed.https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/sci...Sometimes there is insufficient gradient to move the water anywhere, ie the land is too flat. In this case you may be better off building a drywell, which is constructed very similarly.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_well\n \nreply",

      "Our first house was one a 1/2ac lot at the end (bottom -- this will become important later) of a cul-de-sac in a great semi-urban neighborhood in Cary, NC.  We learned after repeated backyard flooding and near-incursion of storm water into our patio door that our street had been built on what had been the original stormwater collection pond for the larger neighborhood.  The builder got permission from the city to move the pond to build our cul-de-sac, but that didn't stop our street from still being the lowest point in the neighborhood, where all surface water ran-off to, and our house was at the very lowest point.Long story short, we ended up installing a french drain on two sides of our house, putting a drain at the end of our driveway to redirect water [from just running down our driveway to our house], having the front wall foundation rebuilt and jacked up because the footer had nearly completely eroded (1970s house), and still needed to add two 24\" square drain boxes in the back yard (with buried 4\" PVC draining into the creek at the back of the property) to remediate all this.  It was also a tree-filled lot and the drain boxes would almost immediately clog with leaves during heavy rains, so I spent a lot of time out there in ankle to knee deep water with a rake to keep the drains clear.This still wasn't enough!  We got a so much surface run-off from our uphill neighbors that it looked like a sheet of rushing water across our backyard during heavy storms. We had a creek at the back of the property but were not allowed to mess with it because of Corps of Engineers easement regulations.  At the end of the day, we finally solved our problems by getting an agreement from our neighbor to let us dig a surface water drain from the low point in their yard into the creek, and then we'd build a \"temporary\" (cf prior easement rules against permanent walls) berm along the property line to prevent surface water from coming into our yard at all.  That \"berm\" was 76 bags of Qwikrete stacked three high and covered with grass clippings, yard waste & mulch.  Technically we could have removed it if the city had inspected, but it was very much a cement wall.We have never since, and never will, build or purchase a house at the bottom of a hill.\n \nreply",
      "One of the prior houses I lived at had so much flooding and water leakage problems from poor construction (prior additions that weren't strictly legal) that lead to carpet and padding having to be removed from concrete floored rooms and eventually mold problems, that when I bought a house a few years after we'd ran away from that disaster of a house we made absolutely sure to my at the high point of the (new) neighborhood so we weren't in the drainage path for anyone.It's particularly demoralizing to see the scope of the problem when it's all that water flooding your property and know there's nothing you can do in the short term, and even the long term is just trying different things and hoping they work, knowing that it will probably take a few tries.\n \nreply",
      "20+ years ago, I had moved into a newly built home. And the first serious rain we got, I had water come into the living room (flooded the porch and seeped under the door). There was no insurance coverage since it was \"surface water\" and thus excluded. So I had to use a shop-vac and rent a couple of blowers to dry it out.There was a ditch out back but it obviously wasn't deep enough. I did the math and ended up with an astounding amount of water flowing by (something like 20,000 gallons per minute[0]) and complained to the builder about it. They sent a couple of guys out there who installed two 4\" corrugated drainage pipes and said it was good enough.When the next big rain happened, where those pipes emptied out there was a 3 foot tall fountain of water from the pressure. It was an amateur Bellagio, lol. The yard still flooded but luckily didn't come into the house again.Since then, the landscaping came in throughout the neighborhood which controlled the runoff. But it taught me a lot of respect for getting slopes & drains right - Always use a larger pipe than you think you'll need.[0] The formula seems to be: V = 0.408 \u00d7 Q/(D^2) where V is velocity in feet-per-second, Q is the flow rate in gallons-per-minute, and D is the diameter of the pipe in inches. I estimated the diameter based on the land profile that was underwater, and timed the velocity by following twigs/leaves floating by.\n \nreply",

You might remember this. I made a video about it, and then another one about the impressive feat of rebuilding the structure. In the forensic report following the incident, one of the contributing causes identified in the failure was the drainage system below the spillway. Rather than being installed below the concrete, each drain protruded into it, reducing the thickness of the concrete and making it more prone to cracking. But why do you need drains below a spillway in the first place? Put simply: water doesn\u2019t just flow on the surface of earth. It also flows through the soil and rock below it. Water that gets underneath a structure creates pressure that can lift and move it. That\u2019s especially true when the water is flowing. Dam Engineers deal with the "

Some minor feedbacks to get potential users hooked perhaps even more likelier:Took me a while to hit the \"Walk\" feature, given that this is perhaps for many the major showcase highlight here. First, having to scroll down on home page to \"Try it out\", then it defaults to \"Fly\" mode and the Fly/Walk toggle is kinda down&right, would suggest top&left (unless RTL default in user agent =). And when this default Fly mode first opens up, the apartment box is pretty small (1/5 of horizontal space here), might consider defaulting to the biggest zoom level that will still show it completely in all rotations (that's what the user'll do next).Nice that the glassy surfaces reflect in Walk mode! Was surprised about lack of specular-highlighting, isn't that fairly cheap compared to reflections? Or maybe planned. Not a dealbreaker on the user side tho I'd guess. But given all the gfx goodies from reflections to ambient occlusion in there, I was a bit curious.Another thing is that sometimes the canvas goes white with Chromium (Version 126.0.6478.182 (Official Build, ungoogled-chromium) Arch Linux (64-bit)).

      "A few things. It makes for no distraction in the eye you\u2019re not using, while still allowing you to have both eyes easily open with focus where you need. Keeping both eyes open vastly reduces strain on the facial/eye muscles.Sometimes a white opaque shield is used, on the theory that allowing light through won\u2019t have potentially negative effects on iris contraction. I can\u2019t speak to the validity of this one.\n \nreply",

      "They're kinda similar in that they're both tempered glasses - where you create residual compressive stress in the outer part of the glass which makes it stronger. However, there are different ways to temper glass. Superfest (and Gorilla Glass in smartphones) uses an ion-exchange technique where sodium ions on the surface are replaced with larger potassium ions.I'm guessing that Duralex uses a thermal tempering process where the glass is heated very high and then rapidly cooled to temper it, but I don't know. Maybe Duralex also uses an ion-exchange and it just isn't as good as the Superfest process. Even with smartphone screens, newer techniques from Corning have created much stronger screens than we had 10-15 years ago even though they're all using the same basic ion-exchange technique.Personally, I love tempered glass even if it might break. They're a lot less likely to break, they're less dangerous if they do break, and they don't really cost that much more. Maybe you'll pay $3/glass for regular soda-lime glasses and $5-6/glass for nice tempered ones, but I bought my tempered glasses a decade ago and still have all of them, despite having moved 3 times (and my packing technique doesn't involve bubble wrap or anything). Maybe Superfest is better, but for my non-restaurant use, tempered glasses like those from Duralex or Bormioli Rocco seem to be good enough.\n \nreply",

      "One of the things that irks me with many of the /r/dataisbeautiful things with Sankey diagrams is somewhere on the line there's \"one big bucket\" that loses all of the data behind it.In my own budgeting, my direct deposit can go to multiple accounts - and I do.  Part goes to my \"allowance\" account and part goes to my \"savings\" account.  Other people have alimony, child support, or similar withholdings from their wages.So the question I have for the example budget on the page, can you have the freelance work go directly to savings?  Or 300 be taken out of salary and go to child support without hitting the main account?  If you have two incomes in a household and the breakdown is \"two personal accounts and one shared account - each person contributes 10% to their own and 10% to the other person's personal account, and 80% to the shared account,\" can that be shown that way rather than one \"main\" account?\n \nreply",
      "With Sankey graphs you can just \"skip\" one stage. So in your example you could go from \"income 1\" directly to \"expense 1\" without first going to the budget. Most people don't do this though, because most people just have all their income go to one bank account, which is the \"big bucket\" that all the money goes through.You can see an example I quickly created for this here: https://sankeymatic.com/build/?i=OoQw5gpgzgBA2gFgKwAYC6MAqIA...\n \nreply",
      "This is so much better. For me the raison d'\u00eatre of Sankey diagrams is to show the dependencies in money flows.For example if I earn $500 from freelance work, but spend $200 on marketing and $400 on transport to do that, then a Sankey diagram like the one on the front page where everything gets intermingled in a main account and expenses get deducted at the end make it seem like this freelance work is a good thing and I should probably do more. In a good Sankey diagram I would immedately deduct the expenses from the freelance work, and see that instead of freelance income reaching my budget I'm actually subsidizing freelance work from my salary income.Similarly in your example it's immediately obvious that if the wage would vanish a lot of the taxes would also vanish\n \nreply",

Was everything from Dice ghosted? That would be useful information.  I would contend that there's no value in the 'total applications' bucket in there at all other than to sum up the leftmost column - which can be done separately.One big bucket isn't necessarily wrong, but if one is trying to show off the features of the Sankey diagram, showing it with the stronger representations that it is capable of doing can be useful.Having seen countless poorly done ones with an everything bucket in the middle that squashes valuable relationships between the inputs and outputs... and that's a turn off for me when they are presented that way.\n \nreply",

Do some of them not even hit the main account?If I made $3000 this month and $300 of that went to a retirement account and $1000 of that went to tax withholdings and another $300 went to child support, and of the remaining $1400, I had direct deposit put $1000 in savings and $400 in allowance... how would that be represented?I contend that for this (these numbers are purely made up for ease of talking about):    (income 1)\n    $3000 -> $300 child support\n          -> $300 company retirement plan\n          -> $1000 tax withholdings \n          -> $300 allowance -> {various 'fun' expenses}\n          -> $1100 savings  -> {various 'not fun' expenses}\n\n    (income 2)\n    $2000 -> $700 tax withholdings\n          -> $200 allowance -> {various 'fun' expenses}\n          -> $1100 savings  -> {various 'not fun' expenses}\n\nThe 'allowance' and 'savings' are each one bucket that have a net $500 and $2200 coming in to them respectively.Having $2000 and $3000 go into one big bucket of a 'main' account, while working under the 'all money is fungible' fails to capture some reality of how money flows.  For example, if income 1 loses their job, child support goes to $0 (not $300 from income 2) as does the $300 for retirement and the $1000 for tax withholdings.\n \nreply",

      "I'm curious about two things. I don't really understand how the randomized addressing helps with data locality. Is it just saying that XOR gives random results, and so adding random hops before doing lookups gives a higher statistical percentage of reaching nodes?Also how does this compare to something like libp2p w/ DCUtR for NAT traversal? Is the NAT problem circumvented by the randomized walk routing?\n \nreply",
      "Yes, the random walk relates to the \"NAT problem\". Basically, due to NAT, peers may not succeed when trying to connect to arbitrary other peers (especially if you assume no TURN servers or other infrastructure to facilitate). The same situation may also arise in mobile ad-hoc networks, where your wireless signals simply don't get everywhere. As a result, the usual greedy routing will get stuck in a local minimal. By prefixing the greedy routing with a random walk, you basically randomize the starting position, and then end up at a random local minima. Replicate at enough local minima (O(sqrt(n)) and do enough (O(sqrt(n)) lookups and the birthday paradox will make it increasingly likely for you to succeed. Without the random walk, both the putter and the getter would greedily route always to their local minimum, and if they differ, never find each other's data.\n \nreply",
      "Where does sqrt come from? Shouldn't it be log? I don't know much about DHTs, but Kademila (BitTorrent's DHT) has query complexity of around O(log n), with n being the total number of nodes in the network. Kademila also uses random node IDs and XOR disrance metric.\n \nreply",

      "I think it is difficult to make general statements about all \"open source\" projects, because there seems to be at least 3 different types of open source projects:1) Small projects, owned and maintained by a single person, with maybe a few random contributors.2) Medium-sized projects maintained by handful of developers, without much organizational structure.3) Large, almost enterprise-scale, projects used by thousands or millions of downstream users, maintained by dozens or hundreds of developers, requiring fairly complex organizational structure.The article says that \"instant you get that first contribution to your code, it becomes an open source project with an open source community of two\", and the purpose of the project changes to \"collaborating on the maintenance of the project\".For me, absolutely not. For most of my personal projects that I have open-sourced, I have no desire to migrate from a Type 1 (small, personal) project to a Type 2 (medium-sized, multiple-maintainers) project.I accept PRs on a case-by-case basis, but I usually reject a vast majority of them: they are often buggy and incorrect, or they don't match the purpose and design of the project, or they are correct but severely incomplete (e.g. missing edge-cases, missing tests, missing documentation, etc). I have discovered that it usually takes me more time and effort to code-review the drive-by contributions into an acceptable state, than to just implement the feature myself.On the other hand, for Type 3 (large, enterprise-scale) critical projects which affect numerous other parties, there is probably a higher level of implicit and social expectations that the project will handle bug reports and feature contributions from 3rd party contributors in a reasonable manner. The development process of a large project probably shouldn't rely on the whims and emotional state of a single maintainer on the project.With regards to \"kindness\", which the article mentions a few times, I think for small projects, it might be reasonable to expect the kindness of the community. But for large projects, it is unrealistic that \"kindness\" will scale to thousands or millions of users. Too many people are too narcissistic, thoughtless, cruel, or all of the above.In summary, it seems to me that the expectations and the dynamics of an open-source project varies quite a bit, possibly depending on the size and character of the project.\n \nreply"
