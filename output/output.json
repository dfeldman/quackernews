Only messages that exist can be saved; an inexistent message\ncannot be saved. But what about that indexical, this?  This\nmessage does not exist. Huh.\n\n* * *\nIt can only be discarded.\n\nWe soon learn that we can do more than refer to a message that does not exist:\nwe may also discard it. A message must exist to be saved; but it may be\ndiscarded without such a constraint. In fact this is the only thing we may do\nwith it; it can only be discarded.\n\n\nPerhaps this can be justified.

As I explored the entries, I noticed two distinct\nmeta-patterns in how people approached building games with Lisp.

At 1 or 2 in the afternoon they\u2019d walk back, discussing politics, philosophy, and physics. Biographer Palle Yourgrau estimates that these walks consumed 30 percent of Einstein\u2019s workday."
