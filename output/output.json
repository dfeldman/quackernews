      "Yes we do. It was a sewer inspection van. If it was the NSA, their van wouldn't look so goofy that people took one look at the photo and assumed it had to be an NSA van, which is what happened here.

      "I think it was a sewer inspection van.Having said that, reading comments like this, I sometimes think it would actually be great cover. Because you have respected people, like yourself, unequivocally stating that it couldn't possibly be an NSA van.But, to say it again, I agree that I don't think the NSA would need to do this. My above line of reasoning certainly doesn't hold too much water under serious scrutiny.\n \nreply"

For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it.When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF\u2019s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: \u201cDo you folks care about privacy?\u201d\u00a0We did. And what Mark told us changed everything.

      "This is cool, but I'm not sure some of the hints are not more red herrings than anything else. Because AI sort of blends things, the prompt needs to be spot on or, for example, India starts looking like any part of the middle east. Traditional China looks like Japan, etc.Also some of the temporal clues were very good, some were 'wtf'.I also laughed at some of the hallucination I witnessed. Like a group of people staring in a telescope pointing straight at a white wall.Fun though, just needs to be honed in a little.It would help to have markers on the timeline for the different ages, at least for the first round! e.g. Bronze age.You already sort of do, being a Gregorian timeline and marking 0 AD as Christ's birth. That's a dead giveaway when you see crosses. So I think it would be fair and useful to give a range of eras as markers on the timeline.The map could also be continental, and the locations more precise than the country.The map could be more exciting, and change based on the timeline selection! It's currently showing the \"current\" map and not the map of the era; which in some respect is relevant.Finally, the scoring could be more explanatory, you got 5,000 / 10,000 for the following reason / calculation method. Maybe a graph of points per time correction and location. It could also be more comprehensive scoring, with a slight multiplier for streaks, a badge for being good at temporal location vs. geolocation etc.Scoring could animate up, to gamify the experience, create a sort of level end screen that builds up excitement. The map could animate and so could the timeline in this end phase.I like the idea, there is a lot you could do to push this further.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for the feedback and the ideas! Is your idea about showing the ages just to make it a bit easier if you don't know exactly when different ages started and ended?\n \nreply",
      "Yeah slightly easier and also educative if you think about it.It also dresses up the timeline so that the game gets its own identity.\n \nreply",

I want to keep playing.A few super nitpicky comments:- I dropped my pin for \"Seward's Folly\" on Alaska.  The videos were clear enough that I knew that's what it was, which made me excited.  But then it said it happened in Washington, DC.- It might be sample bias, but I've only gotten events after year 0 (and technically, it went from 1 BCE/BC to 1 CE/AD.I'd love to play with this my seven year old, but some of the images are too violent.

      "I recommend focusing on general design principles and mindset.- Read \"The Design of Everyday Things\" by Donald Norman - once you understand what makes a good (or bad) door handle, you'll start seeing design patterns everywhere.- Read \"The Art of Game Design\" by Jesse Schell.

      "The most obvious change that happens after hiring a graphic designer is that the app/website stops looking like shit, and adopts a pleasing color palette and set of fonts.  There is real value in this, and the median graphic designer definitely chooses these better than the median engineer.But UX is a broader umbrella which encompasses interaction flows at the large end, and single function widgets at the small end.  For whatever reason, the median human is very bad at predicting the overall UX of a system.  It's rare that you have someone who can look at a spec for a system they've never seen before and accurately predict what will be easy to use vs. hard to use.  Graphic designers are not meaningfully better at this vs. engineers either, it's just uncommon.For that reason, UX is usually developed by copying existing solutions, or using the guess and check method to try out novel things.  It's very difficult to create good UX by design because evaluating the system by imagination is much harder than with an implementation.  Contrast this to backend system design where entire categories of error can be predicted and avoided through basic principles and reasoning.Where this can go wrong is when you think that you can hire for something which is actually rare in the talent pool.  If you have a graphic designer or engineer who has demonstrated an excellent gut feel for UX, then that's incredibly valuable.  But you can't wait around to find such a person, or pretend that you will be able to hire someone like that.\n \nreply",
      "You just perfectly laid out why it's simultaneously difficult to find a new job in UX while getting paid well once you do find a job (if you're good).Those who understand what good UX is and how it manifests itself, value it highly, while many (even in tech) still consider it pixel-pushing and \"pretty colors\".\n \nreply",
      "Doing something because all the big companies do it also leads to cargo cult mentality.

      "Understanding exactly why before applying is not bad advice. But it takes time and can quickly become impractical when you're already pressed for it (like say, a small team startup already lacking a designer). In many cases it's better to just copy the closest thing to what you aspire to become, even if you don't quite yet grasp the details of why they originally made those decisions. All that can be figured out later for your own situation.\n \nreply"

Possibly it was just to contrast more with the blue screens of the computers.I had to stop and consider this, because it seemed to me that yellow was \"obviously\" the correct color. And indeed a few image searches confirmed this: a yellow lightning bolt is by far the most universal symbol for electricity, along with the standard black-on-yellow danger icon.

      "As someone who has worked on a systems programming language for a long time, my strongest advice would be to avoid trying to make syntactic or semantic choices that are just different unless they're really motivated by making the systems aspect better, or to make the language more self-coherent. Having surprises and syntax to learn is a barrier to entry and probably won't impress anyone.That is to say, do focus on systems problems. Key ones I identified are efficient data representation, avoiding needless memory churn/bloat, and talking directly to lower-level software/hardware, like the kernel.Focus on systems programming and not on syntactic niceties or oddities.\n \nreply",
      "You have a lot of questions, so go to https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/Some possible answers:> . Unfortunately I also designed a language with top-level execution and nested functions - neither of which I could come up with a good compilation model for if I wanted to preserve the single-pass, no AST, no IR design of the compiler.- This is the major PITA of C: Is an actual terrible target for transpilers that have aspirations and sophisticated features like Strings, some decent type system, or whatever. So, your option is to target something that is as close to semantics of your language (Basically, any other language that is not C), to the point where your target is MORE sophisticated than your own lang.- I think Zig (for speed/apparent simplicity) and Rust could be good targets instead of C (I wish Rust were way faster to compile!). Assuming Zig, it will simplify other aspects like cross compiling- I don't think is totally possible to avoid have a semi-interpreter for the transpiler, where you at most need a prelude with some hand-crafted functions that do the lifting. With this I mean things like `fn int(I:Int):Int'` so your code output is like `plus(int(1), int(2))`. Langs like APL/J use this for great effects and basically side-step the need for a vm/opcode.

      "One of the issues with systems programming languages is that the definitions programmers use for \"well-understood\" terms vary wildly in actual practice.For example, the term \"side effects\" has half a dozen different meanings in common use. A Haskell programmer wouldn't consider memory allocation to be a side effect. A realtime programmer might consider taking too long might be a side effect, hence tools like realtime sanitizer [0]. Cryptography developers often consider input-dependent timing variance a critical side effect [1]. Embedded developers often consider things like high stack usage to be a meaningful side-effect.This isn't to say that a systems language needs to support all of these different definitions, just a suggestion that any systems language should be extremely clear about the use cases it's intending to enable and the definitions it uses.[0] https://clang.llvm.org/docs/RealtimeSanitizer.html[1] https://www.bearssl.org/constanttime.html\n \nreply",

Maybe I need to try it a bit before I can make up my mind.On the other hand I think the type system could be expanded to support more types of different sizes. Especially if you are going for a systems programming language you want to be able to control that.I think you could have a nil type because it is handy but it would be good if the language somehow made sure that any variable that could potentially be nil has to be explicitly checked before use.\n \nreply",

Otherwise the function is very similar down to shifting the turns and output accumulator to multiply the entry number.

The diversity of contributors and commercial sponsors ensures neutrality and longevity. No single company has veto power. As long as valuable tech comes out, companies stay involved. Some disappear, new ones come along. Linux development works like that as well.Ironically, Chromium at this point is better positioned to become like that. The main issue is that Google still employs most of the developers and controls the roadmap. But there are quite a few commercial chromium based products: Edge, Brave, Opera, etc. that each have development teams using and contributing to it. Add Electron (has its own foundation, based on chromium) to the mix and the countless commercial applications using that and you have a healthy ecosystem that could survive Google completely disengaging if they'd be forced to split off their browser activities.I use Firefox mainly because of the iron grip keeps over Chromium and it's clear intent to cripple ad blocking, grab user data, and exploit its user base. But I worry about the dysfunctional mess that is Mozilla.\n \nreply",
      "> The bad news is that donations are unlikely to happen with the current massive misspending on overpaid people with no technical background that don't code that spend 95% of their budget on themselves, support staff that also doesn't code, offices they don't need, commercial products that flop, monetization schemes that fail, etc.Mozilla already solicits donations, but I wonder if people who donate to them know that Mozilla funds things that are wildly not Firefox-related, like feminist AI conferences in Africa. Meanwhile Firefox looks more and more like an also-ran compared to its competition.

      "I'm a former research mathematician who worked for a little while in AI research, and this article matched up very well with my own experience with this particular cultural divide. Since I've spent a lot more time in the math world than the AI world, it's very natural for me to see this divide from the mathematicians' perspective, and I definitely agree that a lot of the people I've talked to on the other side of this divide don't seem to quite get what it is that mathematicians want from math: that the primary aim isn't really to find out whether a result is true but why it's true.To be honest, it's hard for me not to get kind of emotional about this. Obviously I don't know what's going to happen, but I can imagine a future where some future model is better at proving theorems than any human mathematician, like the situation, say, chess has been in for some time now. In that future, I would still care a lot about learning why theorems are true --- the process of answering those questions is one of the things I find the most beautiful and fulfilling in the world --- and it makes me really sad to hear people talk about math being \"solved\", as though all we're doing is checking theorems off of a to-do list. I often find the conversation pretty demoralizing, especially because I think a lot of the people I have it with would probably really enjoy the thing mathematics actually is much more than the thing they seem to think it is.\n \nreply",
      "Interestingly, the main article mentions Bill Thurston's paper \"On Proof and Progress in Mathematics\" (https://www.math.toronto.edu/mccann/199/thurston.pdf), but doesn't mention a quote from that paper that captures the essence of what you wrote:> \"The rapid advance of computers has helped dramatize this point, because computers and people are very different. For instance, when Appel and Haken completed a proof of the 4-color map theorem using a massive automatic computation, it evoked much controversy. I interpret the controversy as having little to do with doubt people had as to the veracity of the theorem or the correctness of the proof. Rather, it reflected a continuing desire for human understanding of a proof, in addition to knowledge that the theorem is true.\"Incidentally, I've also a similar problem when reviewing HCI and computer systems papers. Ok sure, this deep learning neural net worked better, but what did we as a community actually learn that others can build on?\n \nreply",
      "The Four Color Theorem is a great example! I think this story is often misrepresented as one where mathematicians didn't believe the computer-aided proof. Thurston gets the story right: I think basically everyone in the field took it as resolving the truth of the Four Color Theorem --- although I don't think this was really in serious doubt --- but in an incredibly unsatisfying way. They wanted to know what underlying pattern in planar graphs forces them all to be 4-colorable, and \"well, we reduced the question to these tens of thousands of possible counterexamples and they all turned out to be 4-colorable\" leaves a lot to be desired as an answer to that question. (This is especially true because the Five Color Theorem does have a very beautiful proof. I reach at a math enrichment program for high schoolers on weekends, and the result was simple enough that we could get all the way through it in class.)\n \nreply",

      "I think you're missing the core component. We care __WHY__ the theorem is true. To be honest, the __IF__ part matters a lot less.The thing is that the underlying reasoning (the logic) is what provides real insights. This is how we recognize other problems that are similar or even identical. The steps in between are just as important, and often more important.I'll give an example from physics. (If you're unsatisfied with this one, pick another physics fact and I'll do my best. _Any_ will do.) Here's a \"fact\"[0]: The atoms with even number of electrons are more stable than those with an odd number. We knew this in the 1910's, and this is a fact that directly led to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which led us to better understand chemical bonds. Asking why Pauli Exclusion happens furthers our understanding and leading us to a better understanding of the atomic model. It goes on and on like this.It has always been about the why. The why is what leads us to new information. The why is what leads to generalization. The why is what leads to causality and predictive models.

I suspect that if the size of this finite set were 2, instead of 633, and you could draw these unavoidable configuration on the chalk board, and easily illustrate that both of them are reducible, everyone would be saying \"ah yes, the four colour theorem, such an elegant proof!\"Yet, whether the finite set were of size 2 or size 633, the fundamental insight would be identical: there exists some finite unavoidable and reducible set of configurations.\n \nreply",

      "I highly, highly recommend uv. It solves & installs dependencies incredibly fast, and the CLI is very intuitive once you've memorized a couple commands. It handles monorepos well with the \"workspaces\" concept, it can replace pipx with \"uv tool install,\" handle building & publishing, and the docker image is great, you just add a FROM line to the top and copy the bin from /uv.I've used 'em all, pip + virtualenv, conda (and all its variants), Poetry, PDM (my personal favorite before switching to uv). Uv handles everything I need in a way that makes it so I don't have to reach for other tools, or really even think about what uv is doing. It just works, and it works great.I even use it for small scripts. You can run \"uv init --script <script_name.py>\" and then \"uv add package1 package2 package3 --script <script_name.py>\". This adds an oddly formatted comment to the top of the script and instructs uv which packages to install when you run it. The first time you run \"uv run <script_name.py>,\" uv installs everything you need and executes the script. Subsequent executions use the cached dependencies so it starts immediately.If you're going to ask me to pitch you on why it's better than your current preference, I'm not going to do that. Uv is very easy to install & test, I really recommend giving it a try on your next script or pet project!\n \nreply",

One of the really nice things about Elixir and its dependency manager is that you can just write Mix.install(\u2026) in your script and it\u2019ll fetch those dependencies for you, with the same caching you mentioned too.Does uv work with Jupyter notebooks too? When I used it a while ago dependencies were really annoying compared to Livebook with that Mix.install support.\n \nreply",

It takes it from \"oh god I have to fight Python again\" to \"wow it was actually fast and easy\".I think all the other projects (pyenv, poetry, pip, etc.) should voluntarily retire for the good of Python. If everyone moved to Uv right now, Python would be in a far better place. I'm serious. (It's not going to happen though because the Python community has no taste.)The only very minor issue I've had is once or twice the package cache invalidation hasn't worked correctly and `uv pip install` installed an outdated package until I `uv clean`ed. Not a big deal though considering it solves so many Python clusterfucks.\n \nreply",
      "Agree. I mostly do front end in my day job, and despite JavaScript being a bit of a mess lang, dealing with npm is way better than juggling anaconda, miniforge, Poetry, pip, venv, etc depending on the project.UV is such a smooth UX that it makes you wonder how something like it wasn\u2019t part of Python from the start.\n \nreply",

Poetry recently added option to install python too if I changed my mind.I have already setup CI/CD pipelines for programs and python libraries. Using uv would probably save some time on dependency updates but it would require changing my workflow and CI/CD. I do not think it is worth the time right now.But if you use older environments without proper lock file I would recommend switching immediately. Poetry v2 supports pyproject.toml close to format used by uv so I can switch anytime when it would look more appealing.Another thing to consider in long term is how astral tooling would change when they will need to make money.\n \nreply",
      "> I prefer using python interpreters installed by linux package manager.uv will defer to any python it finds in PATH as long as it satisfies your version requirements (if any):https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/It also respects any virtual environment you've already created, so you can also do something like this:   /usr/bin/python3 -m venv .venv\n   .venv/bin/pip install uv\n   .venv/bin/uv install -r requirements.txt # or\n   .venv/bin/uv run script ...\n\nIt's a very flexible and well thought out tool and somehow it manages to do what I think it ought to do.

While it varies between carriers and between product vendors, it's still an absolute horror show. Until very recently, the security was entirely achieved through obscurity. The 4G and 5G standards have started to address this, but there are still gaps big enough to be deeply concerning. I don't think it's overly hyperbolic to assume that any moderately sophisticated threat actor who wants a beachhead on a carrier can achieve it. I've demonstrated this multiple times, professionally. \nIMHO the hardware vendors from a certain East Asian state have such poorly written software stacks, that they could almost be classified as APTs - security is non-existent.
