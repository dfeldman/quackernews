    "first_paragraph": "How children learn language has long been of interest to those concerned with its evolution. The idea that \u2018ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\u2019 has been promoted, which means the stages of child development on their way to adulthood replicate those of our human ancestors on their way to becoming modern humans. This idea has been applied to language acquisition and its evolution, but I\u2019ve never been persuaded. It is intellectually problematic because our human ancestors were never \u2018on their way\u2019 to anywhere other than being themselves. My interest in language acquisition is different and twofold."

The 512x342 resolution might seem less than impressive today, but for the time it was a pleasantly high-resolution consumer-grade computer. Among other things, the monospaced Monaco 9pt bitmap font featured characters that were 6 pixels wide, allowing the Macintosh to render a standard 80-column terminal with ample room for a vertical scrollbar and other niceties."
