      "This is extraordinary. While JavaScript is needed now, I\u2019d encourage the author to see what needs to be added to CSS to allow a CSS-only solution, and promote it in the CSS community. For example, repeating the clef when wrapping is akin to a sticky table header, and would have more applications than only music.Some CSS notation is wholly new to me:> .stave > [data-pitch^=\"A\"][data-pitch$=\"5\"] { grid-row-start: A5; }I\u2019ve never seen CSS selectors with square brackets before. Apparently it\u2019s an attribute selector: https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/",
      "These css selectors are actually fairly common I would say. They were used for querySelector a lot before Angular, React, etc. In addition in current times they are frequently used to grab elements by their data-testid either for jest tests or e2e tests.",
      "I'd suggest a ::line pseudoelement for that. We already have ::first-line, which could perhaps be considered an abbreviated ::line:first-of-type. Though, ::first-line doesn't seem to support enough properties to be useful here, so maybe another approach is needed.",
      "My only thought on this was to have a strip down the side with a vertically repeating background of an SVG data URL with the clef in it. But I don't like it. It'll be brittle. And it wouldn't support clef / key / time changes very easily.",
      "I started the article thinking \"ohhh the horror, this will not go well.\" And I ended up being mildly impressed with the typesetting quality, especially for the relative simplicity of the approach.  So kudos to the author for demonstrating the flexibility of CSS.I am concerned that there are lots of edge cases, essentially ligatures for engraving, that might not compose so well. A triad, or the author's called-out relative head spacing of 8th and 16th notes, or letting the program align different parts across different grids - would this also work well? Lilypond has proven to be exceptionally flexible for these kinds of complexities.",
      "It would be nigh-on impossible to align parts across different grids \u2013 but it's perfectly possible to generate one huge grid with multiple staves in it. I'm pretty confident that will work out.",
      "It's a nifty solution. But speaking as a music engraver, it could use a lot of improvement, and I don't think there's enough tolerance in CSS to make it work. The beams, slurs, and ties, in particular have real problems visually. This is why other methods of getting notation into the browser don't use such tools. You need pinpoint precision for vector rendering, which is why almost all browser notation is done with SVG or some sort of Canvas drawing.Other than the clever solution of using CSS, why would you do this? One can already do scalable notation in the browser with other tools (Check out Adrian Holovaty's Soundslice or Sibelius Cloud Publishing).",
      "What is a music engraver? I could google it, but I would appreciate a music engraver actually telling me vs some random page on the internet.",
      "Sure. It's an old-fashioned term for the artisans who engraved music notation onto metal plates. These were then inked for pressing. It's a highly specialized skill and requires a deep knowledge of now notation works and how musicians will respond to it. Today it is all done on computer but the artistry of knowing how the notation should look and the meaning behind it is still there. That's the basics but the work we do is quite varied and complicated.It happens that I work for Avid as a designer for Sibelius, the leading music notation program in the world. I also run the Music Engraving Tips Facebook group if you're interested in learning more.",
      "As a player (jazz bassist) I'm amazed by the subtlety of making notation work. Oddly enough, most of my band's material is still not in computer readable form. A lot of it was hand copied."

I really like how fast Saltstack can be as compared to Ansible.I've been using my own homegrown project that does just this - Python roles, server/client, Mako templates: https://github.com/mattbillenstein/saltyIt's very very fast to do deploys on long-lived infrastructure, but it hasn't been optimized for large clusters yet; I expect the server process will be a bottleneck with many clients, but still probably faster than Ansible for most setups.",
      "Hey all, I'm the creator/primary maintainer of pyinfra! Super excited (a little terrified) to see this on the frontpage, happy to answer any questions :)I also hang out on the Matrix room: https://matrix.to/#/#pyinfra:matrix.orgAnother thing: the GH repo points at currently in beta v3 and the docs for this are here: https://docs.pyinfra.com/en/next (highly recommend starting with v3, I just haven't had any time recently to wrap up the release, but it's stable).",
      "As you can see here, the main question is what are the advantages over Ansible, a mature and the most popular agentless configuration management tool written in Python. So I propose putting this answer right to the landing page",
      "I think I tried to shy away from specifically being \"Ansible does this bad so pyinfra does this\" and instead focus on the features that differentiate like \"Instant debugging with realtime stdin/stdout/stderr output (-vvv).\". But it seems like that isn't enough and the landing page needs to be more explicit in comparison. Ty for the feedback!",
      "I applaud trying to be positive and focus on \"this is what we do well,\" but yeah at least some explicit comparison would help. The copy right now is kind of assuming the reader already knows Ansible to compare against as a baseline. Which is probably fair for most people who find your project, but people who find your project are also probably not happy with Ansible and want to know if this addresses their pain points immediately.Is very interesting though, I think I'm gonna try it myself.",
      "I like Ansible, but that doesn't mean thera are no pain points.One of them is handling \"if-this-then-that-else-that\". Being purely declarative, Ansible is horrible at that.Pyinfra can be used in imperative mode, am I right? This would make the use of if-else a breeze, which would be a really good reason for me to to switch.",
      "Ansible is declarative?In puppet and saltstack you can declare that a folder is empty and declare a specific file in this folder. The system's smart enough to delete all the files except the one.To achieve such feat in ansible is hard. Easiest way is to have two tasks, one deletes everything and second recreates your file. Doesn't feel very declarativeUnrelated thing, they don't even try to be declarative in ansible E.g you can have a file with state \"touch\". It not a state if it updates each playbook run!",
      "You're confusing declarative with idempotent. Ansible is both, it won't change anything if the state is already what you declared. The nitpicked case you chose, you want the file to have the latest timestamp, this is a valid state to declare.",

      "This is really neat, but when I saw the headline I got excited that it was something I have been looking for / considering writing, and I figure the comments here would be a good place to ask if something like this exists:Is there a FUSE filesystem that runs in-memory (like tmpfs) while mounted, and then when dismounted it serializes to a single file on disk? The closest I can find are FUSE drivers that mount archive files, but then you don't get things like symlinks.",
      "Closest I found: https://github.com/guardianproject/libsqlfs> The libsqlfs library implements a POSIX style file system on top of an SQLite database. It allows applications to have access to a full read/write file system in a single file, complete with its own file hierarchy and name space. This is useful for applications which needs structured storage, such as embedding documents within documents, or management of configuration data or preferences. Libsqlfs can be used as an shared library, or it can be built as a FUSE (Linux File System in User Space) module to allow a libsqlfs database to be accessed via OS level file system interfaces by normal applications.",
      "Not purely in-memory, but something like https://github.com/jrwwallis/qcow2fuse maybe? It's clunky compared to OSX's DMGs, but if you squint it achieves similar ends.Otherwise you could achieve this with a tmpfs wrapped to serialize to a tarball (preserving symlinks) when unmounted.",

Maybe I'm an odd case, but my main use case for enums is for APIs and database designs, where I want to lock down some field to a set of acceptable values and make sure anything else is a mistake. Or for state machines. Error handling is manageable without enums (but I love Option/Result types more than Go's error approach, especially with the ? operator).",

      "I'm not a fan of sudo.  It's does so much it needs BNF to describe it's configuration format.  Who knows, maybe replacing the configuration with polkit is a good idea.   Still it's a stand alone binary with one clear job to do, simple enough that one person has no trouble getting their head around it so it's not surprising it hasn't had too many problems over it's long life time.This made me smile:> sudo has serious problems though. It's a relatively large SUID binary, i.e. privileged code that unprivileged users can invoke from their own context. It has a complicating configuration language, loadable plugins (ldap!), hostname matches and so on and so on.That is a bit rich coming from the author of systemd, which must be in the running for one of the largest bodies of code that must run as root.  It's also a very complex piece of code.  That complexity is the reason I was completely flummoxed by interactions between systemd and dll's being exploited by the XZ utils hack to attack an unrelated and uncompromised binary: openssh.   Run0 is just an extension of that ball of mud.  It's a stretch to believe it will be more secure than sudo in the long term, which is amusing because it appears Lennarts primary argument is it will be more secure.I'm not the only one who has noticed this: https://lwn.net/Articles/971812/",
      "The article you linked seems to be in support that systemd is in fact simpler than sudo.Sudo, which only does privilege escalations, is only 1/3 the amount of code of the entirety of systemd.Systemd-run has been around for many years now, this is simply an expansion of capabilities of features already exposed.",
      "> That is a bit rich coming from the author of systemd, which must be in the running for one of the largest bodies of code that must run as root.Not really a far comparison given that it\u2019s an init system",
      "Isn't that link showing the opposite? That sudo is really large and systemd isn't? They even compare systemd with wpa_supplicant and it turns out they are the same size.",
      "Not really.  I'm not going the effort of breaking it down like he did, so just looking at total lines in the source calculated with \"wc -l $(find . -type f)\":sudo: 284,103\nsystemd: 1,981,535",
      "I find your comment here sadly indicative of the level of discussion around systemd from its haters.Your metric is utterly misleading not only because you're almost certainly counting non-code files, but more crucially, because the systemd repository contains the code for *sixty-nine* entirely separate binaries, separate tools under the overall systemd project umbrella, so counting their collective code size as if it is the code base of one single gigantic tool, a single gigantic program that compiles into a single gigantic binary, with all the interweaving that implies, is just disingenuous at best. That number does not represent the size of a single attack surface area, and pretending it does is nonsensical. It's like pulling in the source of all of gnu and doing a line count. And for the record, I've actually done this properly, cloning the systemd repository and then reading the documentation to figure out what directories and source files did what, and assembled a list of the directories and source files that represented just systemd-the-init-system, and got about 240,000 lines of code.And remember, it won't actually be systemd the init system that will be replacing sudo, it will be systemd-run, which is a separate binary, with a separate memory space, and a separate permissions model, that merely communicates with systemd the init system to get certain things done. I guarantee you it's probably smaller than the code base of sudo, and this architecture, as LP points out if you actually read his thread on mastodon, far better represents the methodology of running things with at least privilege and privilege separation and so on, because instead of having the binary that is called from unprivileged space managing transitioning itself into privileged space and then doing things, instead the binary always stays unprivileged and just communicates via a strictly defined IPC protocol that gives it no direct abikity to do anything with a process that was already privileged instead, that can decide what to do on its own.Let me leave you with this quote:> If you build systemd with all configuration options enabled you will build 69 individual binaries. These binaries all serve different tasks, and are neatly separated for a number of reasons. For example, we designed systemd with security in mind, hence most daemons run at minimal privileges (using kernel capabilities, for example) and are responsible for very specific tasks only, to minimize their security surface and impact. Also, systemd parallelizes the boot more than any prior solution. This parallization happens by running more processes in parallel. Thus it is essential that systemd is nicely split up into many binaries and thus processes. In fact, many of these binaries[1] are separated out so nicely, that they are very useful outside of systemd, too.> A package involving 69 individual binaries can hardly be called monolithic. What is different from prior solutions however, is that we ship more components in a single tarball, and maintain them upstream in a single repository with a unified release cycle.https://0pointer.de/blog/projects/the-biggest-myths.html",
      "Regarding your first point: some people agree, most notably the OpenBSD people who did something about it and wrote \u201cdoas\u201d as a replacement; which fits the most common use-cases of sudo without fanfare.",
      "And, as LP points out, fails to solve the actual problem because it's still locked into the exact same flawed Unix model, and refuses to integrate with anything else in the system to get things done in a better more systematic way. It's just a slightly refined version of the same tired old Unix way",
      "Use something else then?Linux won on Unix merits.Feels a bit disingenuous to use that against it, especially when including half the system libs has caused one major and highly publicized security issue already",

I've been a deep learning practitioner for ~3 years now, and I feel like this notion has really been impressed upon me only recently.I've spent an awful lot of mental energy trying to conceive of how these things work, when really it comes down to \"does increasing this parameter improve the performance on this task? Yes? Move the dial up a bit. No? Down a bit...\" x 1e9.And the cool part is that this yields such rich, interesting, sometimes even useful, structures!I like to think of this cognitive primitive as the analogue to the idea that thermodynamics is just the sum of particles bumping into each other.

It does not scale to networks larger than a few thousand parameters for obvious reasons.NNs are optimized by directly computing a gradient which tells us the direction to go to to reduce the loss on the current batch of training data. There's no trying up or down and seeing if it worked - we always know which direction to go.SGD and RWP are two completely different approaches to learning optimal NN weights.",

      "The meat of it is here:> Google \u201cretaliated against approximately 50 employees and interfered with their Section 7 rights by terminating and/or placing them on administrative leave in response to their protected concerted activity, namely, participation (or perceived participation) in a peaceful, non-disruptive protest that was directly and explicitly connected to their terms and conditions of work,\u201d the complaint reads.Seems very thin to call on the NLRA here. The \"protesters\" stated goals were to disrupt work even for people not a member of the non-union (therefore not a strike) which is not a protected activity. Moreover, were any of these employees or any members of the minority union actually working on the Israeli contracts they objected to? While you can protest against your job duties under the NLRA (or job duties of your collective union members) I don't see that you can protest against company functions which aren't job duties you or your class aren't a part of.If the workers had just walked off the job and peacefully and non-disruptively protested in front of the building and refused to go back to their job until they (or other members of the minority union) had their job duties modified so they were not working on those projects and google had fired them, that seems like it would violate the NLRA.Anyway this seems like some fun FAFO. I wonder how many of the people who got fired were even members of the non-union before the \"protest\".",
      "Googler protests in the past have typically been walk-outs and other outdoor gatherings. This protest took place within the offices.

It seems more like the activists in this instance went too far and were dealt with accordingly.",

It seems like they are setting a precedent and giving fair warning to anyone else thinking of doing something similar. Things like this can be viral, as seen with the college protests. And the more enabled they are, the worse they get, as seen with Columbia.And to be fair there has been a big shift in the market for tech workers. There was a sort of indispensable aura that protected tech employees before that just isn't there any more. People who think this sort of thing wouldn't yield a rapid firing are living in the past.There is a video from the participants-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLiWHO71fOU&lc=I find it rather incredible.

      "> This is a marked departure from the way Google has handled employee dissent in the past. In 2018, more than 600 Google workers signed an open letter opposing Project Dragonfly, an effort to build a search engine for China. As The Verge reported at the time, the petition began with an internally shared Google Doc, and all subsequent steps were also organized using Google products. Employees also urged Google to drop Project Maven, its contract with the US Department of Defense. That same year, over 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout in protest of the company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment allegations against executives.

This is how Gizmodo describes that protest [0]:> Google\u2019s decision to provide artificial intelligence to the Defense Department for the analysis of drone footage has prompted backlash from Google employees and academics. Thousands of employees have signed a petition asking Google to cancel its contract for the project, nicknamed Project Maven, and dozens of employees have resigned in protest.A petition signed by thousands and a bunch of resignations are very different than staging a sit in in an executive's office and refusing to leave when asked. And both of the protests referred to in the past (Maven and sexual harassment) seem to have had a much stronger base of support than the 20-50 people who participated in this.Is it possible that Google is the same Google and these people have gotten caught up in unreasonable post-2020 expectations for what valid political expression in the workplace looks like?[0] https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-f...",

The more I read about this topic, the more the true narrative seems like \"after the 2018 walk-outs, Google took steps to ensure mass political action within the company like the action that tanked Maven would never happen again,\" and we're now seeing the results of those steps.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Google_walkouts",

      "Couple of thoughts> The combination of the ICCID and the IMSI basically tells the mobile network, \u201chey, this person paid for a plan.\u201dAs far as I remember, the ICCID never actually appears in standard network messaging. It might be possible for the network to request it, but it's not part of a standard 2/3/4/5g attach.The piece seemed to miss two major uses for the IMEI (or I missed it when reading), which were working around vendor bugs and allowing emergency calling.Radio firmware and state machines have always had weird bugs, and even when it conforms to standards (some of which are extremely interpretable), does very weird things in the real world. Pre-smartphone, being able to update phone and radio firmware was extremely rare, so it was common for the networks instead to implement workarounds on a manufacturer or handset basis. Having a hardware ID that identified this was extremely useful.GSM (and onward) actually supports a handset attaching to a network, even without a SIM card, for the sake of emergency calling. It needs some form of unique identifier for this to work. As much as it could (potentially, entirely redefining the stack) generated UUIDs, it makes some sense for these unique IDs to persist across roaming/sessions/reboots.",

Having a hardware ID that identified this was extremely usefulNow that it\u2019s common for devices to be updated regularly, they will typically send an extended form of the IMEI to the network called the IMEISV, which is the same as the IMEI except the final check digit is replaced with a two-digit code indicating the current software version (SV = Software Version).",
      "> As far as I remember, the ICCID never actually appears in standard network messaging.Yeah, that would be the IMSI (which a given SIM card can have multiple of, e.g. for switching to a more beneficial home network while roaming!)The ICCID is useful for identifying a given physical SIM card (e.g. so that the phone can link a given user-selected profile name to it/the associated phone line for a \"preferred line for contact\" indicator in dual-SIM phones), and probably also as an identifier when dynamically assigning a new IMSI over the air.> for the sake of emergency callingThe IMEI can indeed be an identifier of last resort for emergency calls. I wonder if some countries use it to block abuse/spam calls to emergency services, or more importantly, why some others aren't?In Germany, for example, SIM-less emergency calls are no longer possible, supposedly due to many people calling the local emergency number to test whether a used phone is in working condition without inserting a SIM card... I don't know what they're doing with the IMSI in that case, and if it's locking these callers out, why they can't do the same for the IMEI.",
      "At least in the US, the 911 infrastructure is dated.In older systems, your caller ID is sent using in-band DTMF tones, which are decoded by the dispatch computer.On newer E-911 systems they get some additional digital address data from the telephone network, but the record format wasn't designed with VoIP or cellular in mind. So in those cases, the telephone network sends a virtual number and the dispatch computer does a seperate out-of-band lookup with the VoIP/cellular company using that number as a key to get your location.The whole emergency calling system is layers upon layers of hacks. While they can bolt additional functionality on if they're creative, it's more likely a given feature is _not_ implemented. There's a good chance that by the time the call gets to dispatchers, the IMEI/IMSI isn't displayed anywhere and they just see a random virtual number.",
      "Gosh, yes it's a bit of a mess...The PSAP (E911 end point) likely will receive an MDN/MSISDN (10 digit number you dial for NANP networks) - this is so they can call back if the call is dropped.E911 is a special service, so in the case of deactivated/missing SIM cards, the carrier assigns a temporary MSISDN for duration of the call when the UE exits E911 mode - there are actually of regulatory and carrier requirements around E911 mode.E911 Phase 2 required not only the DN, but also if possible the location of the device - whether thru Cell Base Station Triangulation (if possible) or GNSS with a LAT/LONG based on coarse/fine location info.In any case, as @tjohns mentions, IMSI/IMEI are not typically used outside of the servicing network.",
      "Good point, and implementing a \"this IMEI calls 911 to ask for the time of day every hour\" block on the side of the networks seems risky as well, so I get how it might not be that helpful.But then I wonder why having an IMSI (as far as I understand, the SIM can be deactivated, foreign etc., i.e. it doesn't need to actually register to the network) improves this in Germany?Maybe German authorities just hope that having to insert a SIM might deter people, since SIMs are perceived as being personally identifiable more than just phones without a SIM?",

      "Is there any entity or procedure that actually proves what a phone is what it claims to be?Unfortunately, neither IMEI, Serial Number or a combination of both can assert this.I bought a Samsung S24 a week ago off Facebook Marketplace. It was in the box and everything. I cross checked both the IMEIs and also the Serial Number with the #06# test. I even checked them online. Did all the tests, #0# and even downloaded Samsung members. Paid for the phone, convinced it was a genuine one.Upon registering it and using it, it becomes very clear the phone is fake and is at best a clone. The camera is nowhere near the S24 and does not have the features. It heats up after charging and does not keep charge. It runs slower than a 10 year Android once you are signed it.when you run diagnostics, it shows all the specs of an S24 Ultra. How do I know this? I went and got another S24 Ultra from the store and they are worlds apart.So my question is, if you are buying a phone from a reseller or someone, is there any way of definitely asserting whether it is authentic?",

I haven't written myself a twitter, but I've always assumed that this problem is solved by a mix of fan-on-write and fan-on-read.  Most people are fan-on-write, but those with a follower count > $THRESHOLD are fan-on-read.The fan-on-read set is small enough to be easily cacheable, so the extra reads required to service a follower's feed are more than compensated for by the fact that the content is in RAM in a cache.Sounds like RedPanda went exclusively with fan-on-write.

Ultimately two systems are harder to maintain than one, custom indices are hard, and the low-complexity approach dominated a higher-performance approach.Also, contrary to popular opinion, we didn't go down when Justin Bieber tweeted, but we did have elevated error rates when large quantities of Justin Bieber followings put pressure on the MySQL row lock of his following count.

Is it possible to build all this under one platform?I do hope I'm wrong for the sake of pydantic-core.",
      "Pydantic creator here.I understand why this might be your reaction, but let me just share my thoughts:Can we build all the LLM things people want? Yes I think so, early feedback is that Logfire is already much more comprehensive than LLM specific solutions.How is our solution any different? AFAIK:* no one else offers opinionated wrapper for OTel to make it nicer to use, but with all the advantages* no one else does auto-tracing (basically profiling) using import hooks the way we do* no one else has dedicated instrumentation for OpenAI or Pydantic* no one else provides metadata about python objects the way we do so we can render a semi-faithful repr of complex objects (Pydantic models, dataclasses, dataframes etc.) in the web UI* no one else (except Sentry, who are doing something different) makes it really easy to start using it* no one else lets you query observability data with SQLIn my mind, the obvious alternative would be to do the thing most OSS companies do, and build \"Pydantic Cloud\", then start adding features to that instead of the open source package. I didn't want to do that, and I don't think our users would like that either.In the end I decided to build Logfire for two reasons:1. I wanted it, and have wanted it for years2. I think building a commercial product like this, then using OSS to spread the word and drive adoption is a really exciting way to incentivize us to make the open source as good as possible \u2014 good as-in permissive and good as-in well maintained. And it means that our commercial success is not in tension with the adoption of our open source, which has been a recurring issue for companies trying to capitalize on their open source brand.",
      "Useful product, great marketing site. This is obviously a labor of love. Keep it up!Sadly I've moved on from Python world.Funny anecdote, using Pydantic everywhere to improve maintainability made me realize I'm fighting an uphill battle with Python and I should move to a statically typed language, so I switched to C#.Thanks for your work.",
      "This is admittedly an unpopular opinion.I've actually really wondered why one wants static typing, especially with a language as expressive as Python, and where you can be so efficient with it?At a time, I was mesmerized with Zope (esp 3), but learned that nobody really learns to use it, but instead learns to work around it \u2014 for the uninitiated, Zope provided \"interfaces\", you'd have classes implementing those interfaces, and you could happily mix and match with \"configuration\" that lived in ZCML (an XML schema) files, way back in early 2000s.Static typing really kills off some of the biggest benefits of using Python (like \"duck typing\" to quickly emulate an identical API without having to construct a hierarchy of types before you can do that).How many bugs have you really hit in your Python code because of lack of static types? For ~20 years of doing Python, I honestly believe that it could have helped me at most once or twice. Generally, doing sufficient level of testing has covered most potential misuse of code, and you need to have tests anyway.The reason I'd want to move away from Python is mostly pure performance (loops should not be this slow) and library ecosystem (crappy code has risen to the top), but I find nothing is nearly as expressive, has a comparable standard library plus allows one to be so efficient.",
      "Honestly, after spending the last 10 years developing in Python, I'm considering doing something similar. I've lived the problems. They suck for engineering software with longevity.",
      "This is very cool. Could someone use Logfire alongside Honeycomb or another OTel platform? Honeycomb's strengths in drilling into an interactive chart vs. Logfire's strengths in drilling into a stream of text logs (and SQL support!) seem very complementary.Certainly seems like the Logfire initializer could coexist with code like in https://docs.honeycomb.io/send-data/logs/opentelemetry/sdk/p... - is this a reasonable assumption? We're looking into modernizing our Honeycomb integration from their older direct integration to their OTel SDK, and would be very curious if Logfire can exist alongside this. Do you do any patching of OTel internals that would make this impossible?",
      "You can send data from any OTLP endpoint, so yes.I don't think we currently expose an easy way for you to send data to two (e.g. honeycomb and logfire), it it should be entirely doable, and if people want that, we can make it easy.",
      "Thanks for the response, massive kudos - I look forward to trying it out!",
      "Who do you like who does this well?I think Pydantic is great software and so I am inclined to see if this too will be great software.",
      "My last company used Splunk and SignalFx. They were fine, but I wasn't necessarily in the weeds with configuration and usage. The Observability Team made it easy to use.My current company, a much small startup, primarily uses Datadog and we are starting to better integrage Honeycomb. We mostly abandoned Google Cloud Monitoring because the UI/UX are not that great. Honeycomb is a paradigm, so took some time for us/me to understand. It's growing on us.Despite the ability to completely blow up our bill (which is now better controlled), Datadog is a good product that lets us quickly answer questions when things go wrong. It's not perfect, but it's the best we have right now. The UI is intuitive, and facilitates more discovery (esp. for metrics and their attributes)."

      "Long time listener, first time caller (finally made a HN account)..Anyways, can someone please explain how positive/negative plays a factor here? Rh +/- is mentioned once in the article but not discussed as far as being a donor. I was always told O- is the universal red cell donor [1]. Can anyone help explain is this enzyme fixes the +/- component in addition to the ABO component? Thanks![1] https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-types.html",
      "There are three components that can cause problems with transfusions: \"A\", \"B\" and \"Rhesus\". A person can have any combination of those three (8 combinations).The A/B/AB/O is basically having  only A, only B, both, or neither. And the +/- is whether you have the \"Rhesus\" component.The basic rule is that you can't introduce new components to a person who doesn't have them in their system, and will be treated as foreign contaminants.So someone with all three components already (AB+) can take any blood because their system already is used to all three components.A person with none of the components in their system (O-) would have an allergic reaction to any of the three components being introduced. On the other hand their blood is safe to donate to anyone else as it won't introduce any \"unexpected components\" to a recipient.EDIT: ah, I see - article doesn't mention Rhesus. I guess it can convert AB- to O-, or AB+ to O+.",
      "I think O is recessive (if I remember from high school correctly).A is really AO (if we're being verbose). B is BO, AB is AB, O is OO. Each parent passes one of them on. So, a A dad and O mom would mix (being verbose again) AO and OO, and thus the child might be AO or OO, A or O.The + or - is for an independent \"Rhesus\" component, as you say. Not sure how this passes through the genes. This is all like high school level knowledge, so maybe someone can share more if they want.My dad had surgery and some paperwork we received said that he had AB blood. It became a family joke because me and my siblings are all O blood type. If my dad really did have AB blood then we are not his children. The hospital later confirmed it was a mistake.",
      "That's probably a separate and harder problem from this: The A and B antigens refer to the presence of carbohydrates extending from the cell membrane, whereas Rh factor + refers to the presence of a protein.Since there are different classes of bio-molecules, proteins may need different techniques to remove, alter, or cover them up.If we do find such techniques, they may have much broader applications in immunology.",
      "Very cool stuff!\"For the first time, the new enzyme cocktails not only remove the well-described A and B antigens, but also extended variants previously not recognized as problematic for transfusion safety. We are close to being able to produce universal blood from group B donors, while there is still work to be done to convert the more complex group A blood. Our focus is now to investigate in detail if there are additional obstacles and how we can improve our enzymes to reach the ultimate goal of universal blood production,\" says Professor Maher Abou Hachem, who is the study leader at DTU and one of the senior scientists behind the discovery.",

English only.",
      "As much as I will most likely never spend 6 figures on a watch, I greatly appreciate their engineering. Tangential, does anyone know how easy is it to design and build your own movement?",
      "I don't know about the difficulty, but you can look at the complexity of this ETA 6497 movement on GrabCAD [0]. After seeing this a while ago, it made sense to me why small/new brands generally use a Seiko NH35 or something similar that they can buy in bulk.[0] https://grabcad.com/library/eta-6497-1-complete-watch-moveme...",
      "Personally I find it more handy to know day (of week) than date (of month), but I don't think I've every seen a watch that does day-only, usually either date-only or day-date.",
      "This[1] 1980s Raketa has an interesting visual display of the day of the week. The red dot corresponds to the current day. It does however show the date as a number on the bottom as well.[1]: https://mroatman.wixsite.com/watches-of-the-ussr/raketa?ligh...",
      "That's me as well; I had to look through so many watches that show the date with so few that show the weekday.  I wish my Seiko didn't show the date because I have to adjust it 5 times a year, but the day-of-week is always right.Also, Seiko's watchfinder won't let you filter based on whether or not it has a DoW complication; very annoying.",
      "This would actually be a very nice complication, as it would never need to be reset, as long as the watch stays wound. I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve seen, or even thought of.I ended up settling on no-date watches, as I find setting the date to be annoying, and it\u2019s not something I need that often. When I do need it, I have my phone. I think I\u2019d ultimately feel the same way about a day of the week complication.",
      "I think the idea here might be that people already know what day it is but they have to think about the date.",
      "That might even be true for many of the population, but I'm exactly in the target demographic of people who get unsure of such things.My favourite ever gift from friends was that people bought me (last century, long before smartphones) a 24 hour radio synchronized digital alarm clock which knew the day and full date including year. Because while often I know 0600 from 1800, not always, and on a particularly bad day maybe I'm not even sure which week this is. I didn't need the year really, but it felt appropriately completionist, just in case.",
      "Yup. I totally get (from other comments here) that there are exceptions, because everyone's different!But most people always know exactly what day of the week it is, but rarely know the date. (The only time I'm ever unaware of the day is on vacation occasionally.)And the date is needed basically every time I sign anything on paper, as you almost always put a date next to any signature -- whether you're writing a check, filling out forms at the doctor's office, signing consent forms for an activity, and so forth."
