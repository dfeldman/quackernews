      "It's a decent rule of thumb, but it definitely needs some pragmatism.

So it becomes an art more than a science to decide what to focus on.\"fix nothing\" is certainly a horrible approach, \"fix everything\" is often impractical.

So it automatically adjusted the threshold.It worked really well to incrementally improve things without forcing people to deal with them all the time. People would from time to time make sure they cleaned up a number of issues in the files they happened to be working on, but they didn't have to do them all (which can be a problem with strategies that for example lint only the changed files, but require 0 errors).  We threw a small line chart up one one of our dashboards to provide some sense of overall progress.  I think we got it down to zero or thereabouts within a year or so.\n \nreply",

      "The physics of gas turbine engines is one reason I am really excited about electric aviation. People don't realize that you are temp limited at altitude. They think the air is cold, but it is about getting mass through that engine so compressing that air to the density needed brings its temp way up. Electric doesn't have that issue so electric engines could go much higher which means those aircraft could become much more efficient. People focus on the problem of putting enough energy into an electric airframe, but they don't realie the potential massive efficiency gains that it can bring because of the physics of flight.\n \nreply",
      "They are not temperature constrained at altitude.  It's much colder up there.They are air, oxygen really, constrained.You are right that the electric motors themselves won't suffer from the same oxygen starvation, but as the other commenter noted, the props or impeller blades will.  They need something to push, there isn't much up there.\n \nreply",

      "The thinner the air, the more efficient your flight can be, but I never saw this as a temperature problem. My understanding is that there just isn't enough oxygen. Maybe there's an issue with the amount of heating that occurs when you try to compress enough air to get enough oxygen to run your engine?In any case, electric engines don't need oxygen.\n \nreply",
      "> can beTheory != Practice. If that were the only variable, then yes. Electric would be great. But it's not. It's far from the only thing in play. Lift also suffers from thinner air. Pure electric (as-in battery/solid state energy storage) could have 100% efficiency (specifically in converting prop/turbine torque to thrust of moving air), and it'd still have a terrible efficiency problem with current day tech.Electric's primary efficiency and efficacy issue is regarding the total operating weight of the aircraft compounded by how that weight does not meaningfully decrease as the battery banks are depleted as compared to consumable fuels. Weight is your biggest enemy in flight, not power nor mechanical efficiency.Hybrid electric (be it consumable fuel through a generator or fuel cells) is much more promising, but rarely what people mean when discussing \"electric propulsion\" (without the hybrid qualifier), and still has issues of it's own.\n \nreply",

On the surface, it made sense: our AWS bill was pretty steep, iirc into the 6 figures monthly, we could have Azure for free*.Fast forward about a year, and an uncountable amount of hours spent by both my team, and Azure solutions specialists, kindly lent to us by the Azure org itself, we all agreed the six figure bill to one of corporate daddy's largest competitors would have to stay!I've written off Azure as a viable cloud provider since then.

      "I'm a fan of the team of Allen AI and their work.  Unfortunately, the benchmarking of olmocr against marker (https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker) is quite flawed.Throughput - they benchmarked marker API cost vs local inference cost for olmocr.  In our testing, marker locally gets 20 - 120 pages per second on an H100 (without custom kernels, etc).  Olmocr in our testing gets between .4 (unoptimized) and 4 (sglang) pages per second on the same machine.Accuracy - their quality benchmarks are based on win rate with only 75 samples - which are different between each tool pair.  The samples were filtered down from a set of ~2000 based on opaque criteria.  They then asked researchers at Allen AI to judge which output was better.  When we benchmarked with our existing set and LLM as a judge, we got a 56% win rate for marker across 1,107 documents.  We had to filter out non-English docs, since olmocr is English-only (marker is not).Hallucinations/other problems - we noticed a lot of missing text and hallucinations with olmocr in our benchmark set.  You can see sample output and llm ratings here - https://huggingface.co/datasets/datalab-to/marker_benchmark_... .You can see all benchmark code at https://github.com/VikParuchuri/marker/tree/master/benchmark... .Happy to chat more with anyone at Allen AI who wants to discuss this.

I found myself in a work meeting where I was mostly there to let a junior present some joint work we did and answer any questions the junior couldn't. Since I wasn't really needed (the junior eng was awesome), I was fidgeting and wanted to analyze the results from an API I had access to. A few prompts from Claude and I was hitting the API, fetching results, using numpy to crunch what I needed, and getting matplotlib to get me nice pretty graphs. I know Python and the ecosystem well so it wasn't hard to guide Claude correctly.I probably got the whole thing done in 5 prompts and still had enough brain space to vaguely follow along the presentation. Before this kind of thing would have taken 20-30 min of heads down coding.

If you have low tolerance for faults, ChatGPT is bad, but if you are on a crunch and decide its OK to be confidently incorrect some small percentage of the time, then ChatGPT is a great tool.Most industry software jobs, at least the high paying ones, are generally low fault tolerant and that's why ChatGPT is not entirely replacing anyone yet.So, even in your example, and even if you write the code all yourself, there is still a risk that you are operating above your own competence level, do exactly as ChatGPT instructs, and then it fails miserably down the line because ChatGPT provided a set of steps that an expert would have seen the flaws in.\n \nreply"

As an example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) defines \u201csale\u201d as the \u201cselling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer\u2019s personal information by [a] business to another business or a third party\u201d in exchange for \u201cmonetary\u201d or \u201cother valuable consideration.\u201dTHANK YOU California for this definition of selling data, which is accurate, and representative of what people think of when discussions of selling data come up.> In order to make Firefox commercially viable, there are a number of places where we collect and share some data with our partnersOk, so that\u2019s pretty straightforward.

Is the data deidentified or is it not?Is Mozilla just trying to reduce risk in case someone argues their deidentification isn't good enough?

After you fix a hard-to-debug problem, you feel a sense of accomplishment. Which would be ok, but the problem is that this sense of accomplishment is often time higher than it should be. You go home at the end of the day thinking \"well, today I didn't build anything, but it's fine, because I fixed that bug\". You are becoming complacent.If you end up saying to yourself, like the author of this blog here, that you troubleshoot more than you build or you do, then you have a problem. Soon you'll be seen by others as a car mechanic. Maybe a reliable car mechanic. But reliable car mechanics don't get paid a lot.This might be a controversial take but here it is: being proud of your troubleshooting skills sits somewhere between being proud of your typing speed and being proud of your word document formatting skills.

      "People really should look at the work of Gary Stevenson here: https://youtu.be/TflnQb9E6lwThe truth is economic growth hasn\u2019t been occurring in real terms for most people for a long time and the rich have been transferring money from the poor to themselves at a dramatic rate.I\u2019m starting to think the entire system is corrupt and we are headed for a destroyed Europe and a civil war in the US. Maybe I\u2019m very pessimistic but this moment in history feels like the end of the American empire, what comes after this is extremely uncertain but people only seem to demand a fair piece of the wealth after a world war.\n \nreply",
      "Thomas Piketty lays it all out in \"Capital in the 21st Century\"Basically he compares two kinds of growth rates : the growth rate of the 'real' economy and the growth rate of wealth itself. You need the wealth rate to be low enough that rich people want to invest some of it in the real world, not leave it in the bank.If you do tax the rich, they do very well and you also have money to pay for things like education, roads, affordable housing, medical services, scientific research .. which benefit all and lubricate the general economic market.If you dont tax the rich, you end up with a gilded age of emperors and kings or a few robber barrons, a small rich coterie around them and the gawping masses of poor eeking it out.Postwar 70s and 80s were a unusual period of relative lower-inequality, in which we had money in the real economy to develop things.Garys Economics made an interesting point that inequality _itself_ is a problem - because the actual real value of the world remaining the same [ goods, energy available, land, workers, housing, technology ], when there is higher inequality, then the poor are losing a proportion of that real wealth to the rich.   Extreme inequality itself starves almost all the population of a share of real wealth, for them to use their skills effectively - renovate a house, invest in stocks, get a masters degree, do a garage project, travel, have kids, install solar panels etc.\n \nreply",
      "Even if you try to tax the riches, they have billions of ways to evade it. The tax laws are so complicated for a reason. Here in Australia, there were cases that some individuals that earned just about A$1M pa., and they paid ~A$980K to companies registered in Virgin Islands etc. for managing tax affairs. Such arrangement knocked down their taxable income to ~A$19K, and thus they paid probably a couple of dollars taxes if not not even a dime. Eye-opening, right? But those were not those super rich ones. You can just imagine what those super rich people can do. So the burden of the tax would be on mid-income people. I would expect the same in US.\n \nreply",
      "If there were political will to tax the rich then you'd have to, in addition to changing tax law (obviously), fund IRS investigations to ensure the taxes are actually collected. Throwing up your arms and saying \"well we can't tax the rich, they're too powerful and wily, and will easily commit tax fraud to evade those taxes, and in actuality you'll bring in less money\" is exactly the weak attitude that stalls efforts to fund vital services. If you think people will commit tax evasion, then put more resources into investigating tax evasion. Historically, money spent recovering taxes has yielded more than the cost of said investigations.\n \nreply",
      "Two points here:1. Gary\u2019s arguments for taxing the rich aren\u2019t about taxing income. It\u2019s about taxing wealth.2. By his argument, most of the wealth are immovable: the rich disproportionately owns actual, physical real estates, and stocks of actual companies. As these assets are based in the country, you could tax right at the source.\n \nreply",

      "The problems with Piketty's arguments are addressed in the article:\"if America\u2019s rich families in 1900 had invested passively in the stockmarket, spent 2% of their wealth each year and had the usual number of children, there would be about 16,000 old-money billionaires in America today. In fact, there are fewer than 1,000 billionaires and the vast majority of them are self-made\"Yes, if rich people invested their money wisely, gave nothing to charity, spent small amounts, and left their wealth to one of their children, wealth inequality would grow unchecked.But rich people don't do that.\n \nreply",

      "I work as an editor sometimes. I've worked in technical writing, though not specifically science journalism.My guess for why this keeps happening, is that it's a two-step process, fueled by a failure of communication:1. The science writer themselves does understand epigenetics \u2014 but doesn't think it's important to the point the article is making for the reader to understand epigenetics. The writer wants to remove the requirement/assumption of \"understanding epigenetics\" from their writing, while still being technically correct in everything they say. So they choose to gloss an epigenetic change as \"causing changes to the DNA.\" (Which it certainly does! Either chemically \u2014 to the DNA molecules themselves, through methylation; or structurally/topologically \u2014 through modifications to the histones around which the DNA is wrapped.)2. The science writer's not-so-scientific editor comes along, doing a stylistic editing pass; sees the word \"DNA\"; and says \"hey, that's jargon, and we're aiming for accessibility here \u2014 we need to replace this.\" And they (incorrectly) decide that a valid 1:1 replacement for \"DNA\" is \"genes\" or \"genome.\"This invalidating change could be caught... if the publication had a formal workflow step / requirement for the editor to perform a back-check with the original writer after copyediting + stylistic editing, to ensure that validity has not been compromised. I believe that big-name science journals and science magazines do tend to have these back-check steps. But smaller publications \u2014 like the PR departments of universities \u2014 don't.\n \nreply",

      "These studies are at the interface of genetics, sociology, and political action. They are underwhelming in all three domains. The genetics are based in puny sample sizes, and this has been true going back to the Yehuda study (2015, PMID: 26410355) and remains true of this broader followup (42 controls and only 18 in the germline exposure group).

No, never.I don't think the activism/sociological angle here was supposed to be interpreted as being about targeted reconciliation toward existing victims of violence / their descendants. Even if those people are potentially \"living life on hard mode\" as a result of previous violence. (After all, finding and helping those people would require complex infrastructure and lots of money.)Rather, I think the thrust of the implicit activist argument would be closer to:1. Experiencing violence turns out to be even worse for you than we thought \u2014 and in non-recoverable ways! (You can't therapy your way out of epigenetic changes.)2. And so more should be done to prevent/ameliorate violence and its impact on people, before it can cause durable epigenetic changes;3. ...and some \"low-hanging fruit\" in reducing this impact for minimal cost, would be to supply more resources for escaping/coping with violence (e.g. shelters; crisis lines; social workers; restraining orders that actually work) specifically to groups who are demographically most likely to become victims of violence.4. And perhaps we can even use this correlation we've found to also measure the effectiveness of interventions like these \u2014 sampling the trends in epigenomic changes in these vulnerable populations over time (i.e. a repeated cross-sectional study), to know if marginal increases in certain types of resources actually have measurable impacts on \"cushioning\" these populations from violence, enough to prevent these epigenetic changes.\n \nreply"
