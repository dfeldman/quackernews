      "Nice story. An even more powerful way to express numbers is as a continued fraction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction). You can express both real and rational numbers efficiently using a continued fraction representation.As a fun fact, I have a not-that-old math textbook (from a famous number theorist) that says that it is most likely that algorithms for adding/multiplying continued fractions do not exist. Then in 1972 Bill Gosper came along and proved that (in his own words) \"Continued fractions are not only perfectly amenable to arithmetic, they are amenable to perfect arithmetic.\", see https://perl.plover.com/yak/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt.I have been working on a Python library called reals (https://github.com/rubenvannieuwpoort/reals). The idea is that you should be able to use it as a drop-in replacement for the Decimal or Fraction type, and it should \"just work\" (it's very much a work-in-progress, though). It works by using the techniques described by Bill Gosper to manipulate continued fractions. I ran into the problems described on this page, and a lot more. Fun times.\n \nreply",
      "> You can express both real and rational numbers efficiently using a continued fraction representation.No, all finite continued fractions express a rational number (for... obvious reasons), which is honestly kind of a disappointment, since arbitrary sequences of integers can, as a matter of principle, represent arbitrary computable numbers if you want them to. They're powerful than finite positional representations, but fundamentally equivalent to simple fractions.They are occasionally convenient for certain problem structures but, as I'm sure you've already discovered, somewhat less convenient for a wide range of common problems.\n \nreply",
      "> No, all finite continued fractions express a rational numberAny real number x has an infinite continued fraction representation.

I've found them to be very convenient for evaluating arithmetic expressions (involving both rational and irrational numbers) to fairly high accuracy. They are not the most efficient solution for this, but their simplicity and not having to do error analysis is far better than any other purely numerical system.> fundamentally equivalent to simple fractions.This feels like it is a bit too reductionist. I can come up with a lot of example, but it's quite hard to find the best rational approximations of a number with just fractions, while it's trivial with continued fractions. Likewise, a number like the golden ratio, e, or any algebraic number has a simple description in terms of continued fractions, while this is certainly not the case for normal fractions.That continued fractions can be easily converted to normal fractions and vice versa, is a strength of continued fractions, not a weakness.\n \nreply",

With enough computation you can get them arbitrarily close, but when an intermediate result is not rational, you will never be able to compute the true solution (even if it happens to be rational; a good example is that for sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) you will only be able to get a solution of the form 2 \u00b1 \u03f5 for some arbitrarily small \u03f5).\n \nreply"

      "From the paper\u2019s conclusion:\u201cOur findings are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics and emphasise the distinction between the concepts of irreversibility and time-reversal symmetry. Once the arrow of time and a particular low entropy initial condition at have been chosen, then the von Neumann entropy will increase forward in time from the temporal origin. However, a different choice of the arrow of time would have implied the same dynamics. The Markov approximation applied to the time-reversed evolution leads likewise to the same dissipation and entropy increase. Consequently any thermal equilibrium state for a forward-running trajectory is also an equilibrium thermal state for any time-reversed trajectory, and entropy increases in both directions: the system thermalises into both time directions. [\u2026]\u201cFurthermore, we speculate that these results may reflect on the cosmological arrow of time. In fact, the natural assumption that the universe was dissipative from time zero onwards would suggest that a model of it would rely on the Markov approximation performed at the moment of the Big Bang. If so, this would imply that two opposing arrows of time would have emerged from the Big Bang, which would account in turn for the maintenance of time-reversal symmetry despite the ensuing dissipative nature of the universe. We would happen to live in one of them, where dissipation and entropy increase are common experience, but unaware of the existence of the other alternative possibility.\u201d\n \nreply",

Which would suggest any solution with a positive time direction can have a negative time direction, just as easily. Is this widely assumed to be true, or at least physically meaningful?There's also Wick rotations, where you can sub `t -> it'`, and then Minkowskian spacetime becomes Euclidean but time becomes complex-valued. Groovy stuff.I'm not much of a physics buff but I loved reading Julian Barbour's The Janus Point for a great treatment of the possibility of negative time.The craziest thing I've seen though is the suggestion that an accelerating charge, emitting radiation that interacts with the charge itself and imparts a backreacting force on the charge, supposedly has solutions whose interpretation would suggest that it would be sending signals back in time.

      "> What am I missing?Your theory:> If you have a casual system, then statistically, things will tend to become more disordered over time, because there are just more ways to be disordered than ordered.contains a tacit assumption that states are chosen at random.  But assuming that is begging the question.  Why are states chosen at random?  What is the source of the randomness?  Newtonian mechanics doesn't have any obvious source of randomness, and it's an open question whether quantum randomness is \"really random\".  Bohmian mechanics is completely deterministic, and so is (obviously) superdeterminism.It's true that \"there are more ways to be disordered than ordered\", but in any time-reversible dynamic there are exactly as many states where entropy decreases as there are states where entropy increases because for any entropy-increasing state, the time-reversed state has decreasing entropy.\n \nreply",

When t increases again, but you'll have no memory by which to detect the revisitation.I know that I just postulated that there is a time sequence by which the motion of time can be described. But that is only to make the idea graspable to our ordinary sense of time.One interpretation of what I described is the slab model of the universe where time is just another axis and the evolution along that line is fixed. Another interpretation would be that as time moves forward and backwards the state of the universe is free to change. In either case, our perception of our personal timelines would always appear to be unidirectional.\n \nreply",

      "> Lots of clever people seem to agonise about this, but I don't see any problem. What am I missing?I feel the same way. The past is just the direction where things were more ordered (to be glib about it.)Even though the large scale implications of the statistics are profound, star fusion, rivers, etc. the \u201ccause\u201d is statistics.The one place (that I am aware of) where the statistics -> time effect still needs explicit work is how the timal fabric dimension operates differently (but very similarly) to the 3 spacial fabric dimensions of space-time in the very large scale. Often represented by a negative (for time) and three positive (for space) signs in equations. But I assume when we understand how space in the small works, the topology  will still have a statistical explanation.\u2014A very close topic, and the same forehead slap feeling for me, is all the contortions many physicists go through to avoid the many worlds quantum interpretation. Which is the parsimonious interpretation.(Should more accurately be called the \u201cquantum field web\u201d interpretation, according to \u2026 me.)Again statistics: we just think there is a \u201ccollapse\u201d in possibilities when super-positioned information becomes to mixed up for us to remix.The alternative: a mysterious collapse with yet unexplained cause, with deep problems regarding how this introduces another unique \u201ctime\u201d effect, of nearly infinite new information constantly being injected into every interaction everywhere and everywhen in the universe! And this information is supposed to be causeless or self-caused in some mystical (but don\u2019t ever say \u201cmystical\u201d), way.And don\u2019t point out the mockery this makes of \u201cconservation of information\u201d if 99.99\u202699% of information now wasn\u2019t there just one quantum event ago, for all quantum events.Again, statistics completely explains why us biggies experience fields making choices, based on the field equation defining field connection (we experience as event) point distributions, and \u2026 statistics.Yet every day physicists who can\u2019t admit to themselves that we are ourselves constantly expanding webs of superpositions, take for granted that anything they can scale up in the lab will have superpositions, subject to experimental practicalities.Because anything else would violate the field equations.\n \nreply",

And given that so many people starting out don't even know why they might need an oscilloscope, its a pretty good way to introduce the tool without the huge learning curve of features you may not use for the first year of your learning process :-).And then when it comes time to pick one of the many really excellent choices of bench tools, you won't be completely clueless about what the functions of the oscilloscope do. So for $20 I consider it a good value and have recommended it to people who were just starting to learn about these things.[1] https://hackerboxes.com/collections/past-hackerboxes/product... and the experiment guide https://www.instructables.com/HackerBox-0102-Flea-Scope/\n \nreply",
      "Hi all, new here.One post below might be a bit misleading -- it's just 18 Msps, not 100 -- so think of it as good for signals up to 1 MHz or so with decent fidelity...  And it uses a PIC32, not STM32.  It is 12 bit ADC, but the noise floor makes it more like 10 or 11.  A cool thing is it also does digital capture and waveform generation at the same time, but clearly it's all pretty simple...My goal was to be able to get these in a classroom at every seat, where there's already a computer or tablet or chromebook, and have it \"just work\"...    The thing I like the best by far, though, is javascript access -- you only need a webpage for the GUI -- no software install or app store or anything!To go deeper for the classroom experiments, you can use a different \"deep dive\" webpage with a command-line UI and log in interactively and take control of all the pins programmatically in BASIC, and even configure the board to autorun a BASIC program on power-up...  You can make a \"simon\" game with 4 switches, 4 LEDs, a buzzer, and about 100 lines of code...  Or with a thermocouple and an op-amp and a solid-state relay, you can make a cool toaster oven temperature controller for reflow soldering -- which is how I built all the prototypes...  The nice thing is the javascript access on the host comes for free still, and so BASIC can talk directly to the host computer (e.g., running python or powershell)!  Examples are here: https://rtestardi.github.io/pages/I have also had fun with automotive applications for Flea-Scope -- it is so easy to just bring out a phone or tablet and measure a crankshaft sensor -- and without it you're just guessing and replacing components from some diagnostics flowchart...As for licensing, it is all open source, and anyone can rebuild it (and even sell it).  There is a patent on the internal BASIC, but there is also a perpetual license to the software builds I have made and tested and released -- conceivably you could build the scope without BASIC at all -- it is unneeded except when you use the board in \"deep dive\" mode for BASIC programming.If there is interest, I have toyed with the idea of making a Mosquito-Scope, with 2 channels and selectable input amplification (for sub-millivolt signals) based on the still-brand-new dsPIC33A, which is actually cheaper and faster than the PIC32MK.-- Rich\n \nreply",
      "For the price this small thing is really awesome.I think the posted title need to be improved and updated to include function or waveform generator instead of just More.Perhaps because of that most of the comments here just focusing in the oscilloscope part.As any who has dabbled with electronics know your typical workbench is normally consist of oscilloscope, logic analyzer, waveform generator, digital multi-meter and power supply normally 12V DC.It seems to me this little $18 hybrid signals scope/generator can do almost all of these functions, and since they are integrated on the same device you don't need to synchronize them which is a big plus.For old school HP/Agilent/Keysight electronics workbench discrete solutions can easily cost tens of thousands dollars, no kidding.The modern version of this is the Digilent Discovery Pro 3000/4000/5000 series with price tags of several thousands dollars. They are described as the All-In-One High-Speed Mixed Signal Oscilloscope, Function Generator, Power Supply, and DMM.

      "This is probably the most exciting thing I've read about compilers since Alexia Massalin's dissertation. gabrielsroka found this previous thread https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35294111 with discussion with the author and a lot of related reading.The title is an amusing crash blossom; it's about a generator of fast 6502 code, rather than a fast generator of 6502 code or one of the other four possibilities.He says it generates better code than anything he's seen, and on reading the writeup, it's easy to see why:> The ordered basic blocks are then processed from beginning to end, generating multiple assembly code combinations per operation. The list of combinations will grow at an exponential rate, but most can be pruned using ideas from dynamic programming and branch-and-bound. (...) simulated annealing (...) solving a partitioned boolean quadratic problem (PBQP).It's tempting to assume that all this would have been infeasible for financial reasons when the 6502 was in common use, and maybe it is a little memory-hungry, but I think the bigger issue is that this is the kind of work you'd normally expect to see in a doctoral dissertation in operations research, applied mathematics, or GOFAI; there just weren't that many people out there who such an approach would occur to.Now that it's out there, though, it seems like you could apply the same techniques to code generation for more mainstream hardware. (Some of the techniques like the tree-search register allocation would probably require adjustment.) Maybe it wouldn't provide the same benefits because generating optimal code is so easy now, I don't know.  Has anyone tried?\n \nreply",
      "Right, back in the day the main challenge was just to do what you wanted to do within memory and performance constraints, especially when trying to run a compiler on the target system as opposed to cross-compiling. This kind of super-sophisticated code generation, making the compiler itself larger and more memory hungry, just wasn't an option.This is a super hard-core hobby project! The 6502 is a great CPU, at least if you are hand-writing assembler for it, but a poor target for high level languages and difficult to generate high quality code for due to the extremely limited number of registers, quirky addressing modes, and lack of regularity. It's great to see the 6502 getting some love, even if it's 40 years too late to be very useful!\n \nreply",
      "Wasn't most performance-sensitive 6502 code back in the day handwritten in assembly? How does the performance of this compiler compare to that?Not to detract from this work - it's really cool and interesting! But i wonder if it would have been relevant at the time.\n \nreply",

A transition period which has now been going on longer than the internet existed when it started.Maybe 100 years from now we'll finally be able to shut off the last IPv4 system and the \"dream\" of IPv6 will become a reality, but until then, life is strictly more difficult on every network administrator because of dual stack.(Note: no, we could not have done it any other way.

The only thing that worked was DeepFilterNet and it's free, open-source and cargo installable.There's no reason to lock yourself into an intel-only solution. Just use DeepFilterNet. The results of this on my noisy server room were insanely good.

Desktop? OpenVINO. Web? TensorFlow. Mobile and desktop? ONNX. This isnt entirely accurate because ex. I reach for ONNX every time because that is what I'm familiar with. All of them make effort to reach every platform, ex. OpenVINO goes supports ARM, and not in a trivial manner.That all being said, TL;DR:It is \"not even wrong\", in the Pauli sense, to imply OpenVINO is Intel-only, and to describe OpenVINO as \"just glu[ing a model to inference code]\"You're describing 3 different components (a hardware acceleration library, and inference library, and a model) and suggesting the hardware accelerated inference library just glues together a model-specific inference library and a model.

      "I've been using vim for 20+ years and it's been fantastically stable software for me. I have never cared about what version I am using because I've never needed to. An exception to this is that I'm now accustomed to using `:term` which came with vim 8.0 (2016?).I think it's silly when colleagues point out that VS Code has vim bindings. The bindings are what I know and enjoy, but they're only half the point. I like to work with the machine, in the terminal. I don't like my text editor being a browser that pings M$, and will end up doing so again, eventually, even after I have to search up(!) how to disable it.There's a lot of value in moving slow and not breaking things. I'm glad there are maintainers willing to carry that spirit forward.\n \nreply",
      "Few years ago I reported that I can't put a character in the most bottom-right corner when setting my own statusline. Bram responded that this was intentional, as some  (presumably already ancient) terminal emulators had problems with this.I can probably take the vimrc and workflow I had for Vim 6 back in ~2000 and use it in the latest Vim without any changes or problems.And look, if VS Code or whatever works better for some people: great! Fantastic that works for you! But for me, the dedication to compatibility and not breaking existing use cases is something I've really come to appreciate, even though it's a slight annoyance at times.\n \nreply",
      "Beyond personal preferences i think there's great value in having tools that are that stable around.There are plenty of legacy systems around that needs to be maintained and if you can use an efficient and familiar tool that still works in that context that should help such use cases greatly.\n \nreply",
      "I'm right there with you on using :term. I also do a lot of work on console only tty's without X or gui environments and splitting between code/text and term is very handy.\n \nreply",

I don't think anyone looking at a codebase with this maturity should feel \"why aren't there significant new feature updates\".Wayland, ok I can see there are things which need 'bring into the modern era' but I don't think either Wayland, or XDG represents a massive about-face or fork moment. (I don't use graphically aided editors either vi or emacs, I live in terminal emulated space)The moment of fear is when it ceases to be brought into current packaging by the distributions which re-factor it. I don't see any sign of that happening either.\n \nreply",
      "Definitely true, probably of almost everything.Rarely the case, and rarely acknowledged, but almost everything is a tool. If everything followed the Unix principle rather than trying to constantly grow and pivot, we would have a lot more solutions that just work.The more often people think about things as tools under the Unix principle, the (generally) less user hostile they are.\n \nreply",
      "I have to say as someone in tech, one of my \"personal embarrassments\" is that I still only know how to use vim on a basic level. I often see my coworkers flying through our codebases in their custom vim/nvim setups and I gotta say I get a bit jealous.But every time I think about learning vim I always go back to the argument that it's just a tool to get a job done and right now, I'm very good with one particular tool (vscode) and between my dayjob and other responsibilities I just can't justify the time sink to learn vim to a level where I can be \"professionally productive\". For now I mainly use it for git and the occasional markdown document I need to create on the flyBut beyond that I really admire vim and nvmim. The fact that my coworkers can use a 30 year old text editor and extend it to support the latest and greatest LLM's and language servers is just mental to me.I hope Bram is up in heaven right now, teaching god how to quit vim.\n \nreply"

      "One area we have found Caddy invaluable is for local testing of APIs with HTTP2 during development. Most dev servers are HTTP1 only, and so you are limited to max of 6 concurrent connections to localhost. HTTP2 requires SSL, which would normally make it a PITA to test/setup locally for development.Throw a Caddy reverse proxy in front of your normal dev server and you immediately get HTTP2 via the root certificate it installs in your OS trust store. (https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https)We (ElectricSQL) recommend it for our users as our APIs do long polling, which with HTTP2 doesn't lock up those 6 concurrent connections.I've also found that placing it in front of Vite for normal development makes reloads much faster. Vite uses the JS module system for loading individual files in the browser with support for HMR (hot module replacement), this can result in a lot of concurrent requests for larger apps, creating a queue for those files on the six connections. Other bundlers/build tools bundle the code during development, reducing the number of files loaded into the browser, this created a bit of a debate last year on which is the better approach. With HTTP2 via Caddy in front of Vite you solve all those problems!\n \nreply",
      "> HTTP2 requires SSLStrictly speaking it doesn't, unencrypted HTTP2 is allowed per the spec (and Caddy supports that mode) but the browsers chose not to support it so it's only really useful when testing non-browser clients or routing requests between servers. HTTP3 does require encryption for reals though, there's no opting out anymore.\n \nreply",
      "Yep, it's really disappointing they didn't decide to support it for localhost.\n \nreply",
      "I think the reason why they have decided to not support it over plain text is because they would have to detect if the server answers with HTTP/2 or HTTP/1.1, which could be complicated. This is not needed when using TLS since ALPN is used instead\n \nreply",
      "No, that's rather easy for up-to-date browsers. The real reason is that dumb middle proxies might cache/mangle HTTP/2 requests to the point that it simply fails hard, but encryption makes those concerns go away. Yes, there are proxies that can decrypt TLS, but due to how negotiation of HTTP/2 works in TLS (ALPN), dumb proxies will simply not send the signals that it's HTTP/2 capable.\n \nreply",
      "This is meh excuse.  If you want your browser to connect to a gopher server, you type gopher://example.com.  If you want to use http2, http2://example.com should work.

Same idea though.)Having said all that, I just copied the certs out of here https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.24.0:src/... and use them to do browser/http2 stuff locally.  Why steal Go's certificates?  Because it took 1 second less than making my own!\n \nreply",
      "Using http2 as protocol in the URL makes the initial transition complex: One can't share links between different users and clients and from other websites with a guarantee of the \"best\" experience for the user. Not to mention all old links outside the control of the server operator.\n \nreply",
      "Hey, thanks for this. It saves me even more than 1 second!\n \nreply",
      "Which browsers/libraries trust these? Or does the go tool chain install them?\n \nreply",
      "Nothing trusts them, they're just regular self-signed certificates.  There is no benefit to using these over your own self-signed certificates except that you don't have to ask your LLM for the commands to generate them ;)\n \nreply"
