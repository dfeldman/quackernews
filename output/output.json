      "If anybody in Qualcomm leadership is reading this thread: this is a good start, and I applaud you for it. There is also a lot more to do if you're serious about growing your market penetration beyond phones.The drivers might be up on LKML, but they're not mainlined yet. And this is just gen5. It would be great if you could fix your gen4 and 4.5 drivers, so that people building products with your chips weren't stuck on an orphaned vendor kernel that doesn't even upstream to your public fork.Also your boot-chain is still closed and proprietary, and completely different than the one used by all other ARM vendors. Being the special snowflake is not helping your business or your customers.And don't even get me started on Gunyah and GearVM, or on the proprietary, locked nature of your BSP, or how far behind TI and NXP you are on software quality and ease of use. Maybe also consider releasing some actual documentation on your chips.I know multiple developers who have sworn off Qualcomm and will never design with your chips again at any price point. Your closed-off support model is 100% the culprit, and it hurts your core business. Any software support revenue that you managage to extract comes at the cost of goodwill and future chip sales.Your chips are good - best in the industry. If you can up your software game to match, you'll really meet your potential.reply",
      "> Also your boot-chain is still closed and proprietaryNowadays the entire thing until you land in EL1 needs to be signed by Qualcomm as well. This is without \"Secure Boot\" enabled. OEMs only get to run code under the hypervisor. And you might want to use a part of the hardware but someone decided the VM your code runs in shouldn't have access to that, too bad.reply",
      "> ... Also your boot-chain is still closed and proprietary, and completely different than the one used by all other ARM vendors. Being the special snowflake is not helping your business or your customers. ...Why does the boot-chain matter? Can't we just have a custom U-Boot implementation that interacts with the bespoke boot chain while providing standard UEFI support to the rest of the system? Isn't that how Asahi works?reply",
      "It matters when you're doing custom hardware, or when you're designing a product  where boot speed matters, or when you need to implement something special.A full-featured U-Boot implementation would be fine IMO. But for the generations that I've used, that's not on the table. What we get is a proprietary flow through a proprietary hypervisor into a fork of Android's bootloader (even if vanilla Linux is the target OS). There's no way to control startup boot options, and no way to use KVM, Xen or any hypervisor except the proprietary one that's also part of the boot chain.This doesn't lend itself to flexible products, or to products that are easy for a company to design or support. That is why things like this happen: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46008156reply",

      "As someone who uses Mobile Linux, I am pretty excited to see this, but I can't help but wonder if this is only a \"Business decision\" and not necessarily Qualcomm turning over a new leaf for being FOSS friendly:- Their Snapdragon X laptop didn't do very well, and they likely realize an ARM Windows laptop will always be a second class citizen: https://www.techpowerup.com/329255/snapdragon-x-failed-qualc... .- Likewise, Mobile SoCs are completely dependent on Android without proper upstreaming (which they haven't done in the past).- They are seeing Valve spending time and money on FOSS support paying off, especially with their new hardware releases.On the other hand, proper upstreaming of the chips give them much more flexibility for different linux-based OSes.reply",
      "I'm personally rooting for \"business decision\" over \"turning over a new leaf\".If FOSS support is motivated by a clear profit motive, then it'll be viewed positively by shareholders and stick around no matter who is in charge. If FOSS support comes from \"turning over a new leaf\", it could be dropped at a moment's notice in response to a leadership change.IMO we will always see far better FOSS support from the private sector when the time they invest has a positive ROI that is obvious and easy to brag about in a quarterly earnings call.reply"

      "Long-time HN lurker here! Was excited to see this discussion around my major interests of Talmud, Kabbalah, and tech.There are a lot of misconceptions and mystique surrounding the Talmud. I'd like to take the opportunity to clarify some fundamental aspects, as relates to the discussion here:The famous \"Talmud page\" (discussed in the links in the parent comment) was set by a Christian printer in the 16th century.It emulated a common layout in medieval Christian manuscripts for Christian primary texts and commentaries [0].The analogy of the Talmud to a hypertext isn't especially apt, IMO. The Talmud indeed extensively cites Bible and Mishnah, and uses lots of technical terms. In this regard, a better analogy is to legal literature (which is what the Talmud in fact is). While being couched as a (fictional) \"conversation\"/dialogue between rabbis who lived over the course of ~400 years (100 CE to 500 CE).In fact, Kabbalah (as another commenter mentioned) is a better example of a \u201chypertext,\u201d since it\u2019s full of recurring symbols that point to different Sefirot and other core concepts.(By way of credentials: I hold an MA in academic Talmud and Kabbalah, write on these subjects in several venues, and have presented at academic workshops. Over the past two years, I\u2019ve also been developing digital-humanities projects related to this work.)References:[0] https://seforimblog.com/2023/06/from-print-to-pixel-digital-...[1] https://www.ezrabrand.com/p/beyond-the-mystique-correcting-c...reply",

See, for example: https://shas.alhatorah.org/Gemara/Berakhot/2aBut my point is that those marginal notes are an artifact of the 16th century print edition. It's not anything inherent in the Talmud text.The famous 16th-century Mikraot Gedolot edition of the Bible also features extensive marginal notes (the Mesorah) which function much like a dense network of cross-references.In fact, the Mesorah is a medieval work (drawing on ancient sources) and is arguably was one of the most elaborate systems of cross-referencing found anywhere, at the time it was promulgated.This differs from the Talmud\u2019s cross-referencing, which doesn't predate the printed edition (as I note in the Seforim Blog article; the page citations are reliant on the universal page numbers that started from the first print edition).reply",

This makes a rackscale Nvidia system based on 144 \u201cBlackwell\u201d GPU chiplets with an aggregate of 20.7 TB of HBM memory look like a joke.\"Nvidia may have the superior architecture at the single-chip level, but for large-scale distributed training (and inference) they currently have nothing that rivals Google's optical switching scalability.reply",

      "Holy smokes, the NAS in idle consumes more power than my UNAS Pro with 4x8TB HDD and 2X8TB SSD, as well as a Mac mini M1 with a 2TB Samsung T7 SSD, and my 4 access points and 4 protect cameras combined.For reference, the UNAS Pro comes with 10G networking, and will deliver roughly 500MB/s from a 4 HDD RAID5 array, and close to 1GB/s from the SSDs (which it never gets a chance to do, as I use them for photos/documents).My entire \"network stack\", including firewall, switch, everything POE, hue bridge, tado bridge, Homey Pro, UPS, and whatever else, consumes 96W in total, and does pretty much all my family and I need, at reasonable speeds. Our main storage is in the cloud though, so YMMV.reply",
      "Once you venture outside of shove files down network pipe territory you'll find you're comparing apples and oranges.About 10x difference in CPU performance, 4x in RAM, zfs vs btrfs, quicksync, kubernetes/docker etc.Doesn't make the unify an inferior machine - it just reflects a narrower specialized focus on serving files...and yes does so with lower idle draw.reply",
      "\"the NAS in idle consumes more power than my UNAS Pro with 4x8TB HDD and 2X8TB SSD, as well as a Mac mini M1 with a 2TB Samsung T7 SSD, and my 4 access points and 4 protect cameras combined.\"I know that's not true. I say this as someone who measures the power consumption of individual components, and even individual rails with a clamp meter. The OP measures an idle power of 67W. He has 6 x 8TB HDDs. These typically consume 5W idling (not spun down). So the OP's NAS without drives is probably around 37W.A UNAS Pro without drives reportedly consumes 20W with no drives. Adding 4 x 8TB at 5W per drive, means your UNAS Pro config with drives probably idles at 40W (again, drives not spun down). That means you are 17W under his NAS idle power. So you claim your remaining hardware (Mac mini, 4 APs, 4 cameras) run in under 17W... Yeah that's not possible. 17W is peanuts; it's half the power of a phone's fast charger (~30W).PS: for the OP, an easy way to further reduce power consumption is to replace your 500W PSU with a smaller one, like 250-300W which is still amply over-specced for your build. Because the typical efficiency curve of a PSU drops sharply at very low loads. For example at idle when your NAS pulls 67W from the wall it's very probable it supplies only ~50W to the internal components, so it's running at 10% load and it's only 50/67 = 75% efficient. The smallest load for which the 80 Plus Gold standard requires a minimum efficiency is 20%. If you downgrade to a 250W PSU you are enforcing a minimum 20% load for which the 80 Plus Gold standard requires minimum 87% efficiency. The load at the wall would thus drop to 50/.87 = 57W thereby saving you 10W.reply",
      "> the NAS in idle consumes more power than my UNAS Pro with 4x8TB HDD and 2X8TB SSD, as well as a Mac mini M1 with a 2TB Samsung T7 SSD, and my 4 access points and 4 protect cameras combined.Are your drives spun?  70w is a pretty low bar. The nas by itself is probably 40w with drives, Mac mini is another 7-10w (especially at wall) and now we are at 50w, so 20w left for 4 AP and camerasreply",

      "Not really.It's part of the 3-2-1 backup setup, but where other people have their \"offsite backup\" in the cloud, I keep my working copy there, and have backups at home.I outsourced operations of it though. I have self hosted for decades, and for the first time in 15-20 years, I'm able to take a vacation and not bring my laptop in case something breaks.As for main storage, as was probably evident from my comment, I don't have 30TB of cloud storage.

      "> My only complaint about the motherboards has been that buying them from one of the Chinese e-tail sites like AliExpress is considered problematic by some.I love some AliExpress deals for some of my hobby purchases, but a NAS motherboard is not one of them.The contrast between the fashionable case, boutique Noctua fans, and then an AliExpress motherboard doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in the priorities for this build. When it comes to a NAS I prioritize the core components from well known manufacturers and vendors. With everything from hobby gear to test equipment AliExpress has been a gamble on wherever you\u2019re getting the real deal or a ghost shift knockoff or QA reject for me. It\u2019s the last place I\u2019d be shopping for core NAS components.reply",
      "That's a Topton board from the official Topton store on AliExpress. It's strictly equivalent to buying straight from the manufacturer and will be shipped by Topton not AliExpress.The Jonsbo case is probably both cheaper and easier to buy from AliExpress than Amazon too to be fair. It's also a Chinese brand.reply",
      "I wrote this blog and I completely agree with you both!This listing should be as close to a sure thing as you can get on AliExpress. But even then,  dealing with AliExpress when things go sideways isn't always all that great.I have purchased this motherboard from this link, I'd do it again in a heartbeat if I needed to,  and I wouldn't fault anyone for avoiding AliExpress either.If somebody wants to buy from a different vendor, it's sometimes possible to find resellers on Amazon or eBay (myself included).  The prices might be a bit more expensive,  but some folks might think it's worth it.I talk about it in the blog,  it's my understanding that there's shortages of the Intel CPUs which I would expect to drive up the pricing.reply",
      "I was looking at N class CPU builds and very quickly realized they're not for me. For storage only over LAN, low power prioritized use they're a valid play, but there are some tradeoffs that are not obvious at first glance.See those NVMEs he stuck in there? They're running at 1/8th their rated link speed. Yeah...12.5%. (PCIe 4.0 x4 vs PCIe 3.0 x1). This board is one of the better ones on pcie layouts [0], but 9 gen3 lanes is thin no matter how you look at it so all those boards have to cut corners somewhere on thatI decided I'm better off with a ebay AM4 build - way better pcie situation, ECC, way more powerful cpu, more sata, cheaper, 6x nvme all with X4 lanes, standard fan compatibility. Main downsides being no quicksync, power consumption and fast ECC UDIMMS are scarce. That was for a proxmox/nas hybrid build though so more emphasis on performance[0] https://youtu.be/1YJ0s_LxXgU?t=690reply"
