      "This is just for show, and facts won't follow. It's not the first time a French government vows to stick to Open Source.

      "I see a lot of discussion about SRS, and I think most can agree they have improved.What I would like to see covered is a more vague area, but almost more important:It\u2019s the space in between reading/understanding something and the SRS. There are almost no standalone tools dedicated to creating flashcards easily from existing programs (web browser, PDF readers etc.) into popular SRS (Anki, Mochi etc.). They should work almost as OS additions to make everything feel native and frictionless; I don\u2019t need another standalone tool that does X Y and Z, I just need some sort of pipe into an SRS that is Mac friendly and does the job whilst not being in the way.If someone knows of such a tool, I would love to hear about it.\n \nreply",
      "> There are almost no standalone tools dedicated to creating flashcards easily from existing programsI think this is a common misunderstanding. Half the benefit of SRS comes from working out what the flashcards are. You have to circle around a concept, look for similarities, differences, examples, generalisations, properties, etc.Is it hard work? Yes. Does it help understanding? Massively.This is also a very difficult skill which, I believe, is why many people fail to appreciate SRS. They try, write bad flashcards, don't see results, and give up.EDIT: This also leads to another common misunderstanding, that SRS is only good for memorising facts. With proper elaboration (thanks child comment), it can be used to build understanding of complex subjects too.\n \nreply",
      "> Half the benefit of SRS comes from working out what the flashcards are. You have to circle around a concept, look for similarities, differences, examples, generalisations, properties, etc.This is at least half true, but among SRS folks it's overstated.The same argument stands for any creative endeavor.Debussy had a greater experience than I did with Claire de Lune, because he composed it. In turn, my experience of it is probably greater than the next persons' because I learned it. Bottom of the heap is the lowly listener - but I think everyone would agree that listening is a wonderful way to appreciate music and shouldn't be diminished.Same for literature, visual arts, etc etc.The still greater reason that create-your-own has historically dominated for SRS decks is the specific curation aspect. Anything curated by someone else suffers from mismatch with your own intentions and prior knowledge profile.(Plug time. Like most people, I am building my own grandiose SRS app. Some writing on it is here: http://patched.network )\n \nreply",
      "You might be right. I remember when I used SRS seriously for language learning, I got far more out of the cards I created painstakingly than the pre-built ones that I pulled off the shelf. That is - I still remember most if not all of the custom cards verbatim.\n \nreply",

      "I have just tried this afternoon to create with Gemini 2.5 Pro Anki cards to study for my exams. I've been doing it raw: I just paste the whole material (like 100k worth of tokens) into aistudio and generate the flashcards in txt format.For now it's going great, and I think that the cards are good enough as they are (there might be a couple here and there that I would remove or edit, but they don't get in the way of learning).\n \nreply",

      "I haven't tried many variations yet because a basic prompt seems to work well, thought it is important to remind Gemini of not using \";\" inside the text of the cards if you use it as a separator. I imagine that with better prompts you could get it to generate very nice flash cards, but I'm in a little tight schedule, so I can't play around it for too long.Another nicer option I think would be using the structured output of the API to generate the cards in JSON format, and the parse it to the Anki format with a script, but I think this approach is fine for me.The prompt I'm using is this---Using the information in these PDFs, make some Anki cards to study for an exam.The format for Anki cards is```front1;back1front2;back2front3;back3```Remember that you can't use \";\" inside a field because it is used to separate the front and back of a card.If the back of a card is a list of elements, prefer to use \"<br>\" to specify a newline.\n \nreply",
      "I can see that helping a beginner to get a lay of the land, but I see that as no more than training wheels.I created bad flashcards for a long time.

      "A point of note is that the text embeddings model used here is paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 (https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mult...), which is about 4 years old. In the NLP world, that's effectively ancient, particularly as the robustness of even small embeddings models due to global LLM improvements has increased dramatically both in information representation and distinctiveness in the embedding space. Even modern text embedding models not explicitly trained for multilingual support still do extremely well on that type of data, so they may work better for the Voynich Manuscript which is a relatively unknown language.The traditional NLP techniques of stripping suffices and POS identification may actually harm embedding quality than improvement, since that removes relevant contextual data from the global embedding.\n \nreply",

I\u2019d be really curious to see how something like all-mpnet-base-v2 or even text-embedding-ada-002 would behave, especially if we keep the suffixes in and lean into full contextual embeddings rather than reducing to root forms.Appreciate you calling that out \u2014 that\u2019s a great push toward iteration.\n \nreply",

      "(I know nothing about NLP)Does it make sense to check the process with a control group?E.g. if we ask a human to write something that resembles a language but isn\u2019t, then conduct this process (remove suffixes, attempt grouping, etc), are we likely to get similar results?\n \nreply",

      "This is a few days worth of materials to read. If anyone finds it overwhelming, I recommend you read this comic that teaches you the basics of idea behind spaced repetition https://ncase.me/remember/\n \nreply",
      "Dropping a product recommendation -- my favorite spaced repetition + notetaking + learning app: https://www.remnote.com/I'm not affiliated, just a big booster. For those familiar with Anki it follows the same conventions. It has an excellent system for managing cards. Adding cards is as easy as writing a bullet point: [front of card] == [back of card]. They got the ergonomics right and clearly know the space very well; it has the right keyboard accessibility and shortcuts and navigation. It supports the basics you'd expect like cloze deletions (fill-in-the-blank), image occlusion (cover up parts of an image). It manages assets like PDFs and images. It uses FSRS (the best SRS scheduling algorithm atm).It has the best (optional) AI integration into a product I've seen except for the usual code-generation suspects. I'm learning spanish and can type into a bullet point something like \"el vaquero ==< [tab]\" and have the translation automatically generated for me into a forward and reverse card. I'm learning math and can cloze-delete parts of latex equations; the AI can very frequently generate excellent and accurate latex equations, which I can make small edits to as I'd like. These kinds of bonuses make taking live flashcard-based notes during my spanish tutoring sessions and math-based parts of classes feasible.It's less low-level configurable than Anki and more \"works out of the box\" with a smaller extension system. I've had enough of trying to fiddle with Anki. Overall just excellent -- I'm not affiliated in any way. Development is very fast. Release note videos are incredible, minor updates occur ~weekly. I've run into a few bugs, especially when I was traveling overseas where internet isn't strong, but overall very pleased with it.\n \nreply",
      "I'm a big fan of Mochi[1] (also unaffiliated) after getting frustrated with the clunkiness of Anki.Mochi has great native apps on macOS and iOS (and maybe more?), the cards are formatted in markdown so I can generate them with LLMs with a custom system prompt, and I just found out today they have an API so I might try my hand at getting an LLM to push new cards on its own via. an MCP server.1. https://mochi.cards/\n \nreply",

      "It also appears to require an account even for local-only use. It\u2019s nice to see any kind of local support, but making an account mandatory renders that feature somewhat moot. I understand requiring an account for syncing (Anki does this too), but otherwise there\u2019s not much of a good reason for it.\n \nreply",
      "It\u2019s amazing how many people try to make an inferior clone of Anki and profit off of it. The only people who ever fall for it are ones with low computer literacy.\n \nreply",

But that has more to do with constructor theory vs this projectWould love to see someone do a pluggable backend so you could test different \"task ontologies\" against each other.Mainly I came here to say that categories can likely be used to great effect here a la GerochFor instance you can start by modeling tasks as morphisms between substrate states (objects), and then enforce composition explicitly. define constructors as functors that map tasks and substrates while preserving structure.for quantum or irreversible effects, use monads to encapsulate branching and decoherence.

I then started following cryptome near-religiously and one time, when I happened to be in NYC, arranged in in-person-meet with John Young so I could buy some copies of his cd archive, signed. I gave one or two away to friends. He joked that his hat was \u201chiding his lobotomy scars\u201d (I think). Was short but special real life meeting.\n \nreply",

I wanted to know if he would publish whatever documents I might obtain there.I remember that he said I could make a business card (!) saying that I was a special representative or special agent or journalist or whatever I wanted for Cryptome.I said something like \"wait, really?\" and he said something like \"well, who I am to say who does or doesn't work for Cryptome?\" or \"why should anyone believe you when you say you do or don't work for Cryptome? people should never believe each other!\" or something like that.He also warned me to watch out for people messing with my laptop in the hotel.I didn't end up making the business card (I thought it would make people more suspicious of me rather than less, which was probably right), but I think I did send him a couple of documents, in retrospect probably very boring ones.I met him briefly in person once, ironically at the announcement lecture for Wikileaks at HOPE in New York. I remember being confused because I assumed he would get along well with the Wikileaks people, but he was already kind of skeptical or cynical somehow.He was also famous for posting extremely cynical takes to mailing lists.John seemingly felt that power had already corrupted everyone or was always on the verge of corrupting everyone, and that one should be extremely reluctant to believe in anyone's stated motives for anything. I don't know if he thought there was some way out of that scenario or that that was just human nature.

Then the Wau Holland audit lies, selective releases, excessive and unaccounted-for spending, and obsession with money and publicity were all targets of his criticism.John could smell the rot from a thousand miles away.https://cryptome.org/wikileaks/wikileaks-leak.htm\"Fuck your cute hustle and disinformation campaign against legitimate dissent.

Young, who died March 28 at age 89 in New York City, was among the first people to see the need for an online library of official secrets, a place where the public could find out things that governments and corporations didn\u2019t want them to know. He made real the idea \u2013 revolutionary in its time \u2013 that the internet could make more information available to more people than ever before.John and architect Deborah Natsios, his wife, in 1996 founded Cryptome, an online library which collects and publishes data about freedom of expression, privacy, cryptography, dual-use technologies, national security, intelligence, and government secrecy. Its slogan: \u201cThe greatest threat to democracy is official secrecy which favors a few over the many.\u201d And its invitation: \u201cWe welcome documents for publication that are prohibited by governments worldwide.\u201dCryptome soon became known for publishing an encyclopedic array of government, court, and corporate documents.

      "The way I like to explain vim to people new to it is; start from \"the inside out\" on a QWERTY keyboard and assume most people are right-handed.By that, I mean the hjkl navigation keys are the first kind of navigation people want to do and are conveniently easily typed with the right hand in a traditional \"home-row\" position.Next, very common editing commands are associated with home-row keys associated with the left hand; asd, with finding a character on the current line associated with f (and F for finding backward).After those, other lesser used, but still very useful, commands are associated with the rows above and below the \"home-row\".Finally, repeating any of these is bound to prefixed numbers, which are of course two rows above the \"home-row\" on a QWERTY keyboard.Modifiers such as Shift, Ctrl, and others are approximately the same distance as the numeric row, unless one binds CapsLock to be Ctrl on most modern keyboards (note that Sun's keyboard got it right and had Ctrl in the position most keyboards now have CapsLock).Interestingly enough, learning vim can often times follow the above distances from hjkl with great result.\n \nreply",

      "There was a guide that mentioned \"scrabble tile\" movement. `fj` is quicker than `fe` because J is way less common than E.Once you get \"near\", then zeroing in on your target (eg: `fj`, `Fa` for \"adjacent\") can be the fastest/most accurate way to get to where you want to go.\n \nreply",

      "TIL! `f` looks really useful, thanks.\n \nreply",
      "At first I had to count characters. Over time, it becomes intuitive. In the same way that if someone holds up three fingers you don't count \"one, two, three\", you immediately perceive that they are holding up three fingers.For numbers under 10, I usually hit the right amount. For numbers around 30, I might be off by one to five, but move on from then. When I want to remove similar prefixes from multiple non-consecutive lines, I might use things like 31x, go to the next instance (maybe continuing a search with n), and press period.Honestly though, if you're moving forward 31 characters, there's often an easier approach, like 4w (move forward three Words). Again, at first I had to consciously think about which combination to use. Over time it becomes second nature.I still use jjjj sometimes. It's imperfect, but at least it's the human that's the limiting factor, and not the software.\n \nreply",

      "They make LLMs play a very abstract game that rewards them points from answering the same as the other, and punishes them from answering differently, and LLMs tend to converge to an answer. From that to \"social conventions\" there is a long, long stretch. The paper lacks a baseline - wouldn't much simpler (non-LLM) systems also exhibit the same property? Is it that surprising that systems that are clones of each other (because they didn't even try \"mixed societies\" of different LLMs) agree when you give them points for agreeing?Maybe I'm missing something but in my view this is pure hype and no substance. And note that I'm far from an LLM skeptic and I wouldn't rule out at all that current LLMs could develop social conventions, but this simulation doesn't really show that convincingly.\n \nreply",
