      "One caveat that\u2019s easy to miss: the \"simple\" model here didn\u2019t just learn folding from raw experimental structures. Most of its training data comes from AlphaFold-style predictions. Millions of protein structures that were themselves generated by big MSA-based and highly engineered models.It\u2019s not like we can throw away all the inductive biases and MSA machinery, someone upstream still had to build and run those models to create the training corpus.reply",
      "What i take away is the simplicity and scaling behavior. The ML field often sees an increase in module complexity to reach higher scores, and then a breakthrough where a simple model performs on-par with the most complex. That such a \"simple\" architecture works this well on its own, means we can potentially add back the complexity again to reach further. Can we add back MSA now? where will that take us?My rough understanding of field is that a \"rough\" generative model makes a bunch of decent guesses, and more formal \"verifiers\" ensure they abide by the laws of physics and geometry. The AI reduce the unfathomably large search-space so the expensive simulation doesn't need to do so much wasted work on dead-ends. If the guessing network improves, then the whole process speeds up.- I'm recalling the increasingly complex transfer functions in redcurrant networks,- The deep pre-processing chains before skip forward layers.- The complex normalization objectives before Relu.- The convoluted multi-objective GAN networks before diffusion.- The complex multi-pass models before full-convolution networks.So basically, i'm very excited by this. Not because this itself is an optimal architecture, but precisely because it isn't!reply",
      "> Can we add back MSA now?Using MSAs might be a local optimum. ESM showed good performance on some protein problems without MSAs. MSAs offer a nice inductive bias and better average performance. However, the cost is doing poorly on proteins where MSAs are not accurate. These include B and T cell receptors, which are clinically very relevant.Isomorphic Labs, Oxford, MRC, and others have started the  OpenBind Consortium (https://openbind.uk) to generate large-scale structure and affinity data. I believe that once more data is available, MSAs will be less relevant as model inputs. They are \"too linear\".reply",
      "Is this so unusual? Almost everything that is simple was once considered complex. That's the thing about emergence, you have to go through all the complexities first to find the generalized and simpler formulations. It should be obvious that things in nature run off of relatively simple rulesets, but it's like looking at a Game of Life and trying to reverse engineer those rules AND the starting parameters. Anyone telling you such a task is easy is full of themselves. But then again, who seriously believes that P=NP?reply",
      "To people outside the field, the title/abstract can make it sound like folding is just inherently simple now, but this model wouldn\u2019t exist without the large synthetic dataset produced by the more complex AF. The \"simple\" architecture is still using the complex model indirectly through distillation. We didn\u2019t really extract new tricks to design a simpler model from scratch, we shifted the complexity from the model space into the data space (think GPT-5 => GPT-5-mini, there\u2019s no GPT-5-mini without GPT-5)reply",
      "But this is just a detail, right? If we went and painstakingly catalogued millions of proteins, we'd be able to use the simple model without needing a complex model to generated data, no?reply",
      "> To people outside the field\n\nSo what?It's a research paper. That's not how you communicate to a general audience. Just because the paper is accessible in terms of literal access doesn't mean you're the intended audience. Papers are how scientists communicate to other scientists. More specifically, it is how communication happens between peers. They shouldn't even be writing for just other scientists. They shouldn't be writing for even the full set of machine learning researchers nor the full set of biologists. Their intended audience is people researching computational systems that solve protein folding problems.I'm sorry, but where do you want scientists to be able to talk directly to their peers? Behind closed doors? I just honestly don't understand these types of arguments.Besides, anyone conflating \"Simpler than You Think\" as \"Simple\" is far from qualified from being able to read such a paper. They'll misread whatever the authors say. Conflating those two is something we'd expect from an Elementary School level reader who is unable to process comparative statements.I don't think we should be making that the bar...reply",
      "It\u2019s literally called \"SimpleFold\". But that\u2019s not really my point, from your earlier comment (\".. go through all the complexities first to find the generalized and simpler formulations\"), I got the impression you thought the simplicity came purely from architectural insights. My point was just that to compare apples to apples, a model claiming \"simpler but just as good\" should ideally train on the same kind of data as AF or at least acknowledge very clearly that substantial amount of its training data comes from AF.I\u2019m not trying to knock the work, I think it\u2019s genuinely cool and a great engineering result. I just wanted to flag that nuance for readers who might not have the time or background to spot it, and I get that part of the \"simple/simpler\" messaging is also about attracting attention which clearly worked!reply",
      "> I got the impression you thought the simplicity came purely from architectural insights.\n\nI'm unsure where I indicated that, but apologize for the confusion. I was initially pushing back against your original criticism of something like Alphafold having needed to be built first.Like you suggest, simple can mean many things. I think it's clear that in this context they mean \"simple\" (not from an absolute sense) in terms of the architectural design. I think the abstract is more than sufficient to convey this.  > My point was just that to compare apples to apples\n\nAs a ML researcher who does a lot of work on architecture and efficiency, I think they are. Consider this from the end of the abstract  | SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. \n\nTo me they are clearly stating that their goal isn't to get the top score on a benchmark. Their appendix shows that the 100M param is apples to apples to alphafold2 by size but not by compute. Even their 3B model uses less compute then alphafold2.So being someone in a neighboring niche, I don't understand your claim. There's no easy way to make your comparisons \"apples to apples\" because we shouldn't be evaluating on a single metric. Sure, alphafold2 gives better results on the benchmarks but does that mean people wouldn't sacrifice performance for a 450x reduction in compute? (20x for their largest model. But note that compute, not memory).  >  messaging is also about attracting attention\n\nYeah this is an unfortunate thing and I'm incredibly frustrated with this in academia and especially in ML. But it's also why I'm pushing against you. The problem stems from needing to get people to read your paper. There's a perverse incentive because you could have a paper that is groundbreaking but ends up having little to no impact because it didn't get read. A common occurrence is that less innovative papers will get magnitudes more citations by using similar methods but scale and beat benchmarks. So unfortunately as long as we use citation metrics as a significant measure of our research impact then marketing will be necessary. A catchy title is a good way to get more eyeballs. But I think you're being too nitpicky here and there's far more egregious/problematic examples. I'm not going to pick my fight with a title when the abstract is sufficiently clear. Could it be more clear? Certainly. But if the title is all that's wrong then it's a pretty petty problem. Especially if it's only confusing people who are significantly outside the target audience.Seriously, what's the alternative? That researchers write to the general public? To the general technical public? I'm sorry, I don't think that's a good solution. It's already difficult to communicate to people in the same domain (but not niche) in the page limit. It's hard to be them to read everything as it is. I'd rather papers be written strongly for the niche peers and enough generalization that domain experts can get through it with effort. For the general public, that's what science communicators are forreply",
      "Correct. For those that might not follow, the MSA is used to generalize from known PDB structures to new sequences. If you train on AlphaFold2 results, those results include that generalization, so that your model no longer needs that capability (you can rely on rote memorization). This simple conclusion seems to have escaped the authors.reply"

The data is in a 'repository' of my choice. I think I like that very much and it aligns with the kind of general principle I have where it's better to apply filtering etc. on the read side rather than on the write side so that I can publish all sorts of things that I want into my repo and others can then read etc. that stuff.The arrows do seem to imply that commenting on my posts goes into my repo, but I'm sure that's just an imprecision trying to express an idea. The whole thing seems very cool and decentralized.When I went to see what it takes to run a separate PDS on AT, though, I see that it's all nice and packaged up and has certain assumptions:1. It takes care of SSL etc.2. It will stand up HTTPS/WSS servers to handle a bunch of RPCSo in practice, you don't get https://roshangeorge.dev and at://roshangeorge.dev because for the latter you kind of need https://roshangeorge.dev/xrpc and wss://roshangeorge.devTherefore, you probably end up with https://roshangeorge.dev and at://at.roshangeorge.dev and then you can run https://at.roshangeorge.dev and wss://at.roshangeorge.devAll minor stuff and doesn't take away from the main point, but it was a thing.reply",

ActivityPub is more like RSS or email\u2014your local server only has to manage the feeds you subscribe to, and your inbox is directly built from all of the posts you have access to. People you subscribe to send you your posts, and you don't have to process them at all.This is why Bluesky could never have \"private likes\" in the same way Twitter or ActivityPub does\u2014every AppView needs to track the like counts of every post in the network manually. It's a huge hassle! I just don't see this architecture winning out in the long term, when compared to the AP feed-subscription architecture.    primarily because multiple programs can access the same identity\n\nActually, this was how AP was originally designed as well\u2014it was just that the most popular early implementations took shortcuts to remove that functionality to fit them into their existing architecture.

      "I like how Frederick Brooks put it:\"\"\"Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay pencil holder \"for Daddy's office.\"Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.\"\"\"reply",

      "A secure, optional digital ID could be useful. But not in today\u2019s UK. Why? Because the state has already shown it can\u2019t be trusted with our data.- Snoopers\u2019 Charter (Investigatory Powers Act 2016): ISPs must keep a year\u2019s worth of records of which websites you visit. More than 40 agencies\u2014from MI5 to the Welsh Ambulance Service\u2014can request it. MI5 has already broken the rules and kept data it shouldn\u2019t have.- Encryption backdoors: Ministers can issue \u201cTechnical Capability Notices\u201d to force tech firms to weaken or bypass end-to-end encryption.- Online Safety Act: Expands content-scanning powers that experts warn could undermine privacy for everyone.- Palantir deals: The government has given \u00a31.5 billion+ in contracts to a US surveillance firm that builds predictive-policing tools and runs the NHS\u2019s new Federated Data Platform. Many of those deals are secret.- Wall-to-wall cameras: Millions of CCTV cameras already make the UK one of the most surveilled countries in the world.A universal digital ID would plug straight into this ecosystem, creating an always-on, uniquely identified record of where you go and what you do. Even if paper or card options exist on paper, smartphone-based systems will dominate in practice, leaving those without phones excluded or coerced.I\u2019m not against digital identity in principle. But until the UK government proves it can protect basic privacy\u2014by rolling back mass data retention, ending encryption backdoor demands, and enforcing genuine oversight\u2014any national digital ID is a surveillance power-grab waiting to happen.I'm certain it's worked well in other countries, but I have zero trust in the UK government to handle this responsibility.reply",

This database is the definitive record of what you are allowed to do or not do (like reside and work). Which can be changed or deleted at the stroke of a key, through human error or malice. Then what?When (not if) the database becomes an attribute store across a wider scope, the implications are scary. The \"digital ID\" as set out today can't work for its ostensible purpose. Therefore its actual purpose isn't being declared. Not hard to connect the dots.reply",
      "> The government cannot stop this credential from being used except by physically confiscating it or by waiting (years) for it to expireThis is not true. Government agencies generally look up your ID as necessary to check if it's still valid.Stopped for speeding? The cop is going to look up your driver's license.Leaving the country? They're running your passport number.Starting a job? They're checking the status of your SSN.The physical ID is good enough for low-stakes stuff like renting a car with a driver's license, or proving your age to get into a bar.

      "It requires more input energy, but it's been really good to see electrolysis of H2O for hydrogen generation take off. There are honestly industrial/grid scale operations actually starting now (as opposed to being constructed). E.g. Aces Delta in Utah. 220MW of wind/solar as input (i.e. equivalent to power for a medium sized city) As a disclaimer, my wife works on that project, but I think it's incredibly cool regardless.Pyrolysis is a less energy intensive way to produce hydrogen, and does deserve more attention. But it still requires methane as a feedstock.Hydrolysis let's use use hydrogen as essentially a fixed loss battery. It's perfectly complimentary to seasonally variable renewables like wind and solar. Batteries have too high of a loss though time for seasonal or multi-year storage. If you can store it (big if... Not everywhere has a salt dome like Delta, UT), hydrogen really is a great solution.reply",
      "Interesting to see this on the HN front page. On the subject of methane pyrolysis, it turns out if you look at the Gibbs free energy calculation, about half of the energy of methane combustion is released from the formation of water, and the other half from the formation of carbon dioxide. That suggests that if you can be efficient with conserving the heat of pyrolysis, you can make a methane power plant that starts with a pyrolysis step to separate out the carbon atoms in an oxygen-free environment, and then burn the remaining hydrogen to power the cycle, and the end result would be a zero-emissions natural gas power plant. It would require twice as much gas to run, but if you can find a good value-added use for the carbon, it could potentially still be cost effective.This would probably be much more efficient than doing pyrolysis to extract the hydrogen for use in electricity generation somewhere else, because you don't lose the substantial stored heat energy in the process of cooling that hydrogen back down.And I can't help but wonder if fossil fuel companies might suddenly start endorsing aggressive zero-emissions targets if there's a way for this to double the demand for their products, rather than eliminating it.reply",
      "> hydrogen for use in electricity generationHydrogen is way more valuable for chemical production, especially fertilizer. That would be a way to use the excess heat you mention.reply",
      "Some back of the envelope calculations from fellows I work with suggested that the waste heat from a single gas turbine exhaust could supply enough H2 for 3 gas turbines - so a CC power plant with 3 gas turbines, 2 with standard HRSGs that use the exhaust gas to run a steam turbine, and the 3rd using the exhaust heat to run a methane pyrolysis process, would be the preferred configuration. Slightly less efficient, but 0 carbon emissions. The biggest issue would be running the plant at varying loads - you would need storage for excess H2 to run more efficiently.reply",
      "Splitting methane to get hydrogen and carbon seems like exactly the wrong direction to move. Just because we like the idea of hydrogen fuel?reply",
      "It's a great move! Methane economy already exists. Methane storage and transport is reasonably simple and scalable.Convert to hydrogen at point of use, and you can claim all the hydrogen hype without having to do all the hard things with hydrogen. If you accidentally oxidize methane instead of converting to hydrogen and oxidizing hydrogen, whoopsie-doodles, but it might be a simpler system.reply",
      "We already need carbon black, graphite, etc. This process makes production have dramatically less carbon emissions with hydrogen as a bonus. Of course we use millions of tons of hydrogen for things like fertilizer.  What's not to like?reply",
      "Why is it the wrong direction? It seems to me to be the perfect direction, if we can make it happen. Methane is plentiful and cheap. If we can burn it without emitting CO2, what's not to like?reply",
      "The other commenters are myopically, dangerously wrong in the worst possible way. We must stop pulling carbon out of the ground yesterday. Climate change isn't a hoax, isn't going away, and is an existential crisis that must be addressed by eliminating carbon extraction to the greatest degree possible sooner rather than never.reply",

      "There are a lot of interesting dynamics in this market.For example, CAT bonds are generally tied to the specific natural hazard (\"this bond triggers if a hurricane of Category 3 or higher land falls in this segment of Florida\") or to industry losses, as estimated by an agreed upon source.This means that a CAT bond is correlated with, but not directly informed by an insurer's actual loss experience. Traditional reinsurance (so an insurer themselves getting insurance) will usually be tied to specific policies, so their experienced loss is what determines payout.However, depending on the insurer's policies, traditional reinsurance may be unavailable or much too expensive (either due to the large limit needed, the risk level of the policies, or any number of other reasons). Depending on the trigger, a CAT bond can also pay out faster because you don't have to wait to see the claims from 100k home insurance policies.From the technical side, most large reinsurers license CAT modeling software from one or both of the same two vendors: Moody's RMS or Verisk. The biggest reinsurers will develop their own models, and there \n are other modeling vendors that they may license for particular perils (EQEcat for earthquake and KatRisk for flood come to mind), but the big two are pretty widely accepted in reinsurance markets.That means if your policies are \"odd\" in some way (uncommon construction type, power facility, etc.), depending on how a reinsurers chooses to model them (or how the model specifically handles them) can have a big impact on your reinsurance pricing. If you know something about your policies that can't be incorporated into a vendor model very well, you may get better pricing on a CAT bond.These are just some of the considerations! There are so many more things that go into it. But I think it's super interesting to think about.Source: I work in this side of the industry, specifically in natural catastrophe modeling.reply",
      "Correct on every point and great insight, hello fellow insurance person.I will clarify that CAT bonds can have industry loss triggers OR actual indemnity triggers. If an indemnity trigger then the insurer has to prove the actual loss. But you\u2019re right on ILWs (Industry Loss Warranty) in that there is additional model/basis risk considerations.Insurance companies try to minimize this basis risk. Because while sure it\u2019s great to be in the situation where your CAT bond recovers when you didn\u2019t have large losses, it\u2019s NOT good to be in the position where you had big losses and you don\u2019t recover. Certainty of recover can affect things like how much regulatory credit you get for your reinsurance.reply",

I guess this is such a niche product that there isn't widespread knowledge about it.I wonder how much more diversified $ILS could be if it were larger.  Would a 10x increase in assets under management give it significantly less volatility because it could do a better job spreading risk around the globe?reply",
      "The lack of information was my inspiration for building Riskvest. I called my own broker and when I said catastrophic bonds they asked if I meant buying bonds already in default.On the risk side - your comments here are part of the myth I\u2019m trying to dispel and will have lots more to say in future posts.Yes for a single CAT bond you are exposed to potential 100% principle losses. But if you buy a bundle of CAT bonds that focus on say California Earthquake, Florida Hurricane, Japanese Typhoon, and a Cyber Event, you can imagine the diversification benefit you get there.I\u2019ve already created a very very simple model for people to play around with and learn the intuition for CAT bond return patterns. A default means 100% loss and this is unique vs. other bonds. I plan in the future to build a much more robust model.https://www.riskvest.io/data-lab/cat-bond-portfolio-simulato...reply",

In essence, investing in insurance risk is like partnering with an insurer \u2014 you share in the results of the portfolio, keeping a slice of the underwriting profit if claims come in below premiums, or sustaining a loss if they come in above.This brings us to the concept of collateralization.

      "> This post covers one appealing way to constrain the weight matrices of a neural network\u2014by keeping the tensors constrained to submanifolds at each layer. This opens the door to re-thinking optimization, as we can co-design optimization algorithms with these manifold constraints. As an example, we propose a manifold version of the Muon optimizer whose weights are constrained to the Stiefel manifold: the manifold of matrices with unit condition number. We conclude the post by defining the idea of a modular manifold, which is a composable manifold that attempts to make it easier to scale up and train large networks.Very good presentation. Projected gradient methods were popular during the convex optimization craze two decades ago. The ideas advanced here have precedent and seem sensible to me. My concern is whether it helps much. The test accuracy in figure 6b shows a marginal increase, and a gentler transition to the overfitting regime, suggesting the regularization is working. The higher LR did not translate to a speed up: \"Manifold Muon increased the wall clock time per step compared to AdamW...\"More fundamentally, I am a bit skeptical that low test accuracy is the right goal in LLMs because statistical learning theory does not adequately model the macro-behavior of very large models.reply",

To explain them you have to look past classical statistics to statistical mechanics.reply",

      "I don't think it's been tried at scale, with large models.It remains to be seen if it works better than conventional training schemes.reply",
      "> Isn't this an old idea?\n\nSo are neural networks. So is attention.What's your point? Sometimes things need to be retried. Sometimes there are small subtle details that make or break an idea. So what's the point of acting dismissively? If an old idea that didn't work now works, then what's the problem? Besides, progress is typically iterative, not through leaps and bounds. The vast majority of things that look like leaps are just because we don't see the steps between.The reason I'm saying this is because that sentiment is often used to pass over working solutions and slows down their progress. So even if unintentional it should cause us to rethink how we respond. Otherwise we end up with such silly claims like \"Einstein just used Tensors\" and \"Nash just used topology\". In some sense these are accurate, but they are too high level descriptions (and these are real dismissals. Which again, so what? If it works, it works?).Why is \"novelty\" even a question? Novelty is only ever in the eyes of the beholder.  > What is novel about the approach in the blog post? Serious question, I really can't tell after reading the post.\n\nHonestly, I do not know, but I'll give you my best read on it.1) Scale: Don't underestimate the importance of this. While I don't think scale is all you need, it certainly is a critical factor.2) Different optimization: I may be missing something, but it looks like they are using a different optimizer. They mention that they're using the muon optimizer constraining to a Stiefel manifold. Neither of those things are unique on their own, but is their combination? This is where I'm uncertain because such a thing would be easy to miss. Maybe someone did and was unsuccessful with it. Maybe someone did, but was not at scale. Maybe someone did, it worked, and just nobody noticed (that happens a lot!).So I think this is quite similar to how 99% of progress and breakthroughs are made: putting together ideas that seem unrelated and inventing some glue to generalize the process. At a high level this always looks like you're just putting existing things together, but that glue is really hard to make. And to continue that analogy, if we do a good enough job gluing things together then to anyone but an expert it'll look like there is no glue. It can be surprisingly difficult to tell if something is glued, welded, mated, milled, printed, or whatever. It usually takes a very keen eye to determine the answer non-destructively.reply",

I just want to push back against it because it is too common and misused even with good intentions. I hope you don't see this as me saying anything about your character. Honestly, impressions are that you do care.  > It sounds like the generalisation of projected gradient decent to \"Muon\"\n\nI'm not a niche expert here, but do have knowledge in adjacent/overlapping domains. It sounds like you're in a similar boat? I ask because this pulls back to what I was trying to say about sometimes needing an expert eye.If it helps, here's the \"paper\" for the Muon optimizer[0] and here's a follow-up[1]. Muon is definitely a gradient decent technique, but so are Adam, SGD, Ada, and many more[2].The big thing of Muon is using NewtonSchulz5. So you update parameters with \u03b8_{t-1} - \u03b7[NS_5(\u03bcB_{t-1} + \u2207L(\u03b8_{t-1}))] (I bracketed so you can see that this is just a specific version of \u03b8_{t-1} - \u03b7F(\u2207L(\u03b8_{t-1}),...) which the standard gradient descent -- \u03b8 - \u03b7\u2207L(\u03b8) -- is in that class of functions, right?). So we should be careful to over generalize and say that this is just gradient descent. You could even say [1] is \"just [0] but with weight-decay\" (or go look at the Adam and AdamW algos ;)But one thing I should add is that gradient descent algorithms aren't topologically aware. I was able to find this post which asks a related question, trying to find what the conditions are for a surface's geodesic to align with gradient descent (note Newton differs from GD too). I don't think this paper is creating a solution where the GD formulation results in following a geodesic to the minimum, but my take is that it is working towards that direction. And to clarify, we'd want to follow the geodesic because that gives us the shortest or most energy efficient path (which ever perspective you want to use). In optimization we want to try to accomplish these two things (and more!): 1) take the \"best\" path to the optima, 2) find the best optima. Unfortunately these are ill-defined and there's not always objective answers to them. But in an ideal gradient descent algorithm we'd want it to go to the global minimum and take the fastest path, right? So with that it helps to be aware of the geometry (part of why people look at the Hessian but that comes at the cost of increased computation even if the additional information can get us there in fewer steps. So that's not (always) \"the best\").I know this isn't a full answer and maybe with more reading I'll have a better one for you. But I'm hoping my answer can at least help you see some of the underlying nuanced problems that (_I think_) the authors are trying to get at. Hopefully I'm not too far off base lol. I'm hoping someone with more expertise can jump in and provide corrections/clarifications in the mean time.[0] https://kellerjordan.github.io/posts/muon/[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982[2] (far from a complete list) https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#algorithms[3] (I think similar types of questions may also be fruitful) https://mathoverflow.net/questions/42617/functions-whose-gra...reply"

It's closer to being purely art. Take image generation for example. Most of the disruption is coming from competition with graphic design, marketing, creative/production processes, etc. The art world isn't up in arms about AI \"art\" competing with human art.reply"

      "All: \"Please don't complain about tangential annoyances\u2014e.g. article or website formats, name collisions, or back-button breakage. They're too common to be interesting.\" - https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html.It's not that these things aren't annoying\u2014it's that they are annoying, and that drives tons of dyspeptic discussion that in the end drowns out anything that's actually interesting.

      "In almost 20 years of working in FinTech at various banks, hedge funds startup etc, a lot of this rings true.e.g.- Critical path/flow diagrams [0] are incredibly useful for both laying out what has to happen in serial vs what can be parallelized. That being said, I've almost NEVER seen them used and 90% of the time they are used it's b/c I made one- SO many important processes are not documented so people can't even opine about how to fix them. I once documented a process and everyone agreed step 4 was wrong. What was amazing is no one agreed on what step 4 actually was.- Most of the big arguments I've seen about projects are less \"what should we do\" but more \"when do we want it\" e.g. one party want's it next week but another one wants to have more features so it will take longer. [1] I've often dealt with this by using the following metaphor:\"Oh, so you want to move house every two weeks?If you give me six months I'll build you the world's most amazing Winnebago/RV with a hot tub, satellite TV, queen size bed and A/C.If you want it tomorrow I'm going to give you a wheelbarrow, pillow and an iPad.\"0 - https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/chapter3/67/2-flow-d... and https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/chapter3/71/6-swim-l...1- https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/chapter3/51/reality-...reply",

That being said, I've almost NEVER seen them used...Making technically good decisions is one of a distressing number of domains where making any attempt at all will put someone a long way ahead of the game vs most people who wield power. Several advanced techniques that nearly nobody seems to do:\"Do we have evidence that this is a good idea?\"\"What if we assume that we achieve the most likely outcome of this action, based on past experience and checking what happened when other people tried doing it?

      "> [0] Please someone get this one into the mainstream US debate next time they're trying to start a war.Speaking as someone with 20 years in uniform and as a War College grad (if only by correspondence) . . . the military ironically has this wired more than any other institution in the Federal government.  The reason the military gets drawn into so much of US foreign policy is not because of a fetish for blowing things up.  It's because it's the only institution where formalized planning is a thing, the only one where feats of large-scale logistics are par for the course, and the only one where \"I'm not going there because I might get hurt\" isn't a valid excuse.As an example, one of the best ways for distributing aid after a natural disaster is an amphibious task force, because you can send the same Marines in to distribute aid that you would to take territory.  And going into relatively unprepared areas and setting up infrastructure for follow-on forces is basically their bit either way.The problem comes in because military force is never the complete solution in and of itself outside of something like what's currently happening in Ukraine.  And when you involve all the other agencies plus scads of glory-seeking politicians, it's hard to keep things from becoming a shitshow.reply",

      "Right, the military quells the warzone, and you still need a plan for after that. That's the 80-100% part, coming from people outside the military.reply",
      "Seems pretty simple unless you are secretly stanning for the orcs.  Ownership of the land should revert to the status quo ante before Putin's initial incursion into Crimea.  Those whose property has been destroyed or mined should be compensated with seized Russian assets.  Kidnapped Ukrainian children should be returned to what's left of their families.What alternatives would be more fair, from your perspective?reply",
      "I read this as a logistical question rather than a moral one. What happens when two farmers can't agree on where their property boundaries sat prior to the war, the fences got ripped out after one side used the area as a staging ground, and any records have been blown up by glide bombs? What happens to the real, physical land that's covered in mines and needs to be either cleared or fenced? Where can Maria and her family stay tonight, next week, and where will they end up? These aren't (necessarily) problems for the military to solve.reply"

      "I've been saying what we actually need is universal dental care vs universal health care for over 15 years.  Giving out universal health care without dental care is like changing the oil in a car but failing to see the tires aren't even on.I heard horror stories from my mom who worked in a periodontist office (as receptionist) growing up.  Really got me to care about oral health early on.  Health really starts at the mouth.  If you don't have a healthy mouth you'll never have a healthy body.reply",
      "I find it completely strange that dental care isn't just considered part of standard healthcare. Like, so my employer's health care plan covers every part of my body except my mouth? Why does my mouth specifically need its own plan?reply",
      "It's a really unfortunate historical accident, especially in the US.Dentistry evolved relatively late compared to regular medicine, and early oral procedures were mostly tooth extractions, which ended up being predominantly done by barbers, who would also do surgery (!). These procedures were often considered crude and beneath that of a trained doctor, and they were generally performed by self-trained practitioners. There were several attempts in the 1800s to integrate dentistry into mainstream medicine, but they failed, both because the doctors of the time didn't think of dentistry as being a real science, but also because, as dentistry started to legitimize itself, the dentists themselves preferred being separate.For some reason the same separation also evolved in the U.K., but it's more integrated in other countries. For example, basic dental coverage is part of national healthcare in Germany and Japan. In the U.S., dentists have their own schools and licensing boards and so on, which isn't the case in the rest of the world, where dentistry is usually accepted as a regular branch of medicine and taught at the same universities.reply",

      "Are you thinking universal health care would help, with respect to this article, even if people can't remember to brush their teeth?reply",
      "Yes, it would help to know that I could see a dentist who, as a side effect, would remind me of the benefits of brushing my teeth and the cavities and gingivitis that I am (or am not, depending on genes), developing as a result, rather than not being able to know for lack of funds.Perhaps good oral hygiene should be taught in school? The same people who attack UBI tend also to attack public education, as well as universal standards for such.reply",
      "1) I find numbers like \u201c3-fold increased risk\u201d a bit meaningless without knowing the baseline risk.2) Here is an audio interview with one of the authors of the study: https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/audio-player/19004027reply",
      "The association between pathogens and cancer is under-appreciated, mostly due to limitations in detection methods.For instance, it is not uncommon for cancer studies to design assays around non-oncogenic strains, or for assays to use primer sequences with binding sites mismatched to a large number of NCBI GenBank genomes.Another example: studies relying on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which is a rich database for cancer investigations. However, the TCGA made a deliberate tradeoff to standardize quantification of eukaryotic coding transcripts but at the cost of excluding non-poly(A) transcripts like EBER1/2 and other viral non-coding RNAs -- thus potentially understating viral presence.Enjoy the rabbit hole. :)reply",
