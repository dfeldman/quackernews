      "Calling Nvidia niche feels a bit wild given their status-quo right now, but from a foundry perspective, it seems true. Apple is the anchor tenant that keeps the lights on across 12 different mature and leading-edge fabs.Nvidia is the high-frequency trader hammering the newest node until the arb closes. Stability usually trades at a discount during a boom, but Wei knows the smartphone replacement cycle is the only predictable cash flow. Apple is smart. If the AI capex cycle flattens in late '27 as models hit diminishing returns, does Apple regain pricing power simply by being the only customer that can guarantee wafer commits five years out?reply",
      "So let's say TMSC reciprocated Apple's consistency as a customer by giving them preferential treatment for capacity. It's good business after all.However, everyone knows that good faith reciprocity at that scale is not rewarded. Apple is ruthless. There are probably thousands of untold stories of how hard Apple has hammered it's suppliers over the years.While Apple has good consumer brand loyalty, they arguably treat their suppliers relatively poorly compared to the Gold standard like Costco.reply",
      "At this scale and volume, it's not really about good faith.Changing fabs is non-trivial. If they pushed Apple to a point where they had to find an alternative (which is another story) and Apple did switch, they would have to work extra hard to get them back in the future. Apple wouldn't want to invest twice in changing back and forth.On the other hand, TSMC knows that changing fabs is not really an option and Apple doesn't want to do it anyway, so they have leverage to squeeze.At this level, everyone knows it's just business and it comes down to optimizing long-term risk/reward for each party.reply",
      "Apple has used both Samsung and TSMC for its chips in the past. Until the A7 it was Samsung, A8 was TSMC, and the A9 was dual-sourced by both! Apple is used to switching between suppliers fairly often for a tech company; it's not that it's too hard for them to switch fab, it's that TSMC is the only competitive fab right now.There are rumours that Intel might have won some business from them in 2 years. I could totally see Apple turning to Intel for the Mac chips, since they're much lower volume. I know it sounds crazy, we just got rid of Intel, but I'm talking using Intel as a fab, not going back to x86. Those are done.reply",
      "But wasn't the reason they split with Samsung because they copied the iphone in the perspective of Jobs (to which he reacted with thermonuclear threats)?They did had the expertise building it after all. What would happen, if TSMC now would build a M1 clone? I doubt this is a way anyone wants to go, but it seems a implied threat to me that is calculated in.reply",
      "Job's thermonuclear threats were about Android & Google, not Samsung because Schmidt was on Apple's board during the development of Android.> \"I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple\u2019s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I\u2019m going to destroy Android, because it\u2019s a stolen product. I\u2019m willing to go thermonuclear war on this.\"The falling out with Samsung was related, but more about the physical look of the phonereply",
      "> because it\u2019s a stolen productThis is funny coming from Jobs.reply",
      "If Samsung (or any other fab) were to make Apple chips they wouldn\u2019t learn anything that a good microscope couldn\u2019t already tell them.Samsung still makes the displays and the cameras for most iPhones.  They continued to do business even while engaged in legal action.  That they are still competitors wont stop them doing business when it suits them.  Business doesn\u2019t care about pride or loyalty; only money.reply",
      "Doesn't seem likely, TBH. Nevermind the legal agreements they would be violating, TSMC fabs Qualcomm's Snapdragon line of ARM processors. The M1 is good, but not that good (it's a couple generations old by this point, for one). Samsung had a phone line of their own to put it in as well. TSMC does not.reply",

E.g. icebreakers, identifying and facilitating the right introductions by highlighting mutual interests, making sure wallflowers have a good time, defusing tensions, food, etc.3. Decreased American tolerance for and ability to handle awkwardness, and there's always going to be some awkwardness in social interactions.4. Decreased public/accessible American meeting places. There used to (< 2000) be a plethora of low-cost, broadly-accessible spaces that could serve as training wheels for events (handling food, furnishings, cleaning, etc).

      "My decision making to use svelte? TBH I looked at source only well after I was far enough along development to be committed to it as a framework.That said, I don\u2019t have any regrets, it\u2019s a pleasure to use svelte and I trust the team\u2019s direction. This particular app is already locked down to internal/trusted users. For something more public or security critical it may warrant a deeper dive and more consideration.reply",

On a machine with Core i5 something or other and SSD it takes about 2 seconds for the calculator to appear the first time I push that button.  On the Core 2 Duo machine that preceded it, running XP from spinning rust, the calculator would appear instantly - certainly before I can release the button.But also WinXP was the OS a lot of people used during their formative years - don't underestimate the power of nostalgia.Also, for some people the very fact that Microsoft don't want you to would be reason enough!Personally if I were into preserving old Windows versions I'd be putting my effort into Win2k SP4, since it's the last version that doesn't need activating.\n(I did have to activate a Vista install recently - just a VM used to keep alive some legacy software whose own activation servers are but a distant memory.

And that\u2019s down and up.I see it being in cache already as sort of game playing, i.e. we can say anything is instant if we throw a cache in front of it. Am I missing something about caching that makes it reasonable?

      "I've yet to be convinced by any article, including this one, that attempts to draw boxes around what coding agents are and aren't good at in a way that is robust on a 6 to 12 month horizon.I agree that the examples listed here are relatable, and I've seen similar in my uses of various coding harnesses, including, to some degree, ones driven by opus 4.5. But my general experience with using LLMs for development over the last few years has been that:1. Initially models could at best assemble a simple procedural or compositional sequences of commands or functions to accomplish a basic goal, perhaps meeting tests or type checking, but with no overall coherence,2. To being able to structure small functions reasonably,3. To being able to structure large functions reasonably,4. To being able to structure medium-sized files reasonably,5. To being able to structure large files, and small multi-file subsystems, somewhat reasonably.So the idea that they are now falling down on the multi-module or multi-file or multi-microservice level is both not particularly surprising to me and also both not particularly indicative of future performance. There is a hierarchy of scales at which abstraction can be applied, and it seems plausible to me that the march of capability improvement is a continuous push upwards in the scale at which agents can reasonably abstract code.Alternatively, there could be that there is a legitimate discontinuity here, at which anything resembling current approaches will max out, but I don't see strong evidence for it here.reply",
      "I used to get made up APIs in functions, now I get them in modules. I used to get confidently incorrect assertions in files now I get them across codebases.Hell, I get poorly defined APIs across files and still get them between functions. LLMs aren't good at writing well defined APIs at any level of the stack. They can attempt it at levels of the stack they couldn't a year ago, but they're still terrible at it unless the problem is so well known enough that they can regurgitate well reviewed code.reply",
      "It feels like a lot of people keep falling into the trap of thinking we\u2019ve hit a plateau, and that they can shift from \u201caggressively explore and learn the thing\u201d mode to \u201cteach people solid facts\u201d mode.A week ago Scott Hanselman went on the Stack Overflow podcast to talk about AI-assisted coding. I generally respect that guy a lot, so I tuned in and\u2026 well it was kind of jarring. The dude kept saying things in this really confident and didactic (teacherly) tone that were months out of date.In particular I recall him making the \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right!\u201d joke and asserting that LLMs are generally very sycophantic, and I was like \u201cAh, I guess he\u2019s still on Claude Code and hasn\u2019t tried Codex with GPT 5\u201d. I haven\u2019t heard an LLM say anything like that since October, and in general I find GPT 5.x to actually be a huge breakthrough in terms of asserting itself when I\u2019m wrong and not flattering my every decision. But that news (which would probably be really valuable to many people listening) wasn\u2019t mentioned on the podcast I guess because neither of the guys had tried Codex recently.And I can\u2019t say I blame them: It\u2019s really tough to keep up with all the changes but also spend enough time in one place to learn anything deeply. But I think a lot of people who are used to \u201cplaying the teacher role\u201d may need to eat a slice of humble pie and get used to speaking in uncertain terms until such a time as this all starts to slow down.reply",
      "> in general I find GPT 5.x to actually be a huge breakthrough in terms of asserting itself when I\u2019m wrongThat's just a different bias purposefully baked into GPT-5's engineered personality on post-training. It always tries to contradict the user, including the cases where it's confidently wrong, and keeps justifying the wrong result in a funny manner if pressed or argued with (as in, it would have never made that obvious mistake if it wasn't bickering with the user). GPT-5.0 in particular was extremely strongly finetuned to do this. And in longer replies or multiturn convos, it falls into a loop on contradictory behavior far too easily. This is no better than sycophancy. LLMs need an order of magnitude better nuance/calibration/training, this requires human involvement and scales poorly.Fundamental LLM phenomena (ICL, repetition, serial position biases, consequences of RL-based reasoning etc) haven't really changed, and they're worth studying for a layman to get some intuition. However, they vary a lot model to model due to subtle architectural and training differences, and impossible to keep up because there are so many models and so few benchmarks that measure these phenomena.reply",

GPT-5 is definitely still very sycophantic, 'You're absolutely right!' still happens, etc. It's true it happens far less in a pure coding context (Claude Code / Codex) but I suspect only because of the system prompts, and those tools are by far in the minority of LLM usage.I think it's enlightening to open up ChatGPT on the web with no custom instructions and just send a regular request and see the way it responds.reply",

The various implementations of Prolog add custom string operators but they are not cross compatible, so code written with strings in SWI-Prolog will not work in Scryer Prolog. Code logic is expressed entirely in rules, predicates which return true or false for certain values. For example if you wanted to get the length of a Prolog list, you write this:Now this is pretty cool in that it allows bidirectionality, or running predicates \"in reverse\".

What I'm most interested to see: will this actually be implemented in practice, or will it be incredibly rare and niche, like Bayesian methods are currently in most biomedical fields?reply",
      "Regulators are generally really conservative. Spiegelhalter et al. already wrote a fantastic textbook on Bayesian methods for trial analysis back in 2004. It is a great synthesis, and used by statisticians from other fields. I have seen it quoted in e.g. DeepMind presentations.Bayesian methods enable using prior information and fancy adaptive trial designs, which have the potential to make drug development much cheaper. It's also easier to factor in utility functions and look at cost:benefit. But things move slowly.They are used in some trials, but not the norm, and require rowing against the stream. This is actually a great niche for a startup. Leveraging prior knowledge to make target discovery, pre-clinical, and clinical trials more adaptive and efficient.Journals are also conservative. But Bayesian methods are not that niche anymore. Even mainstream journals such as Nature or Nature Genetics include Bayesian-specific items in their standard submission checklists [1]. For example, they require you to indicate prior choice and MCMC parameters.[1] https://www.nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.p...reply",

I\u2019m surprised there are still holdouts, especially in fields where the stakes are so high. There are also plenty of blog articles and classroom lessons about how frequentist trial designs kill people: if you are not allowed to deviate from your experiment design but you already have enough evidence to form a strong belief about which treatment is better, is that unethical? Maybe the reality is a bit less simplistic but ive seen many instantiations of that argument around.reply",

      "> Look at my drafts that were started within the last three months and then check that I didn\u2019t publish them on simonwillison.net using a search against content on that site and then suggest the ones that are most close to being readyThis is a very detailed, particular prompt. The type of prompt a programmer would think of as they were trying to break down a task into something that can be implemented. It is so programmer-brained that I come away not convinced that a typical user would be able to write it.This isn\u2019t an AI skepticism post - the fact that it handles the prompt well is very impressive. But I\u2019m skeptical that the target user is thinking clearly enough to prompt this well.reply",

      "Since LLMs were introduced, I've been of the belief that this technology actually makes writing a *more* important skill to develop than less. So far that belief has held. No matter how advanced the model gets, you'll get better results if you can clarify your thoughts well in written language.There may be a future AI-based system that can retain so much context it can kind of just \"get what you mean\" when you say off-the-cuff things, but I believe that a user that can think, speak, and write clearly will still have a skill advantage over one that does not.reply",
      "FWIW, I've heard many people say that with voice dictation they ramble to LLMs and by speaking more words can convey their meaning well, even if their writing quality is low. I don't do this regularly, but when I have tried it, it seemed to work just as well as my purposefully-written prompts. I can imagine a non-technical person rambling enough that the AI gets what they mean.reply",
      "Setting up SpeechNote with Kokoro is one of the the best things I've ever done.I can speak faster than I type, and the flow state is much smoother when you can just dump a stream of consciousness into the context window in a matter of seconds. And the quality of the model is insane for something that runs locally, on reasonable hardware no less.Swearing at an LLM is also much more fun when done verbally.reply",
      "Thats a fair counterpoint, and it has helped translate my random thoughts into more coherent text. I also haven't taken advantage of dictation much at all either, so maybe I'll give it a try. I still think the baseline skill that writing gives you translates to an LLM-use skill, which is thinking clearly and knowing how to structure your thoughts. Maybe folks can get that skill in other ways (oration, art, etc.). I don't need to give it essays, but I do need to give it clear instructions. Every time it spins off and does something I don't want, its because I didn't clarify my thoughts correctly.reply",
      "The prompt the user enters is actually not the prompt. Most agents will have an additional background step to use the user's prompt to generate the actual, detailed instructions, which is then used as the actual prompt for code generation. That's how the ability to build a website from \"create a website that looks like twitter\" is achieved.reply",
      "My 85 year-old father could probably resolve 90% of his personal technology problems using an LLM.

      "Reminds me of one of my managers who said, \u201cSometimes, you have to let people fail.\u201d It does take a lot of energy to keep some people afloat. My hope has always been they learn to swim as it were, but sometimes it\u2019s just effort better spent elsewhere.I know one project did not have my involvement and couldn\u2019t have succeeded without my knowledge. They were so bad they would work in questions casually to their actual work.I started avoiding all of them when I found out management had been dumping on my team and praising theirs. It\u2019s just such a slap in the face because they could not have done well and their implementation was horrible.reply",
      "> Reminds me of one of my managers who said, \u201cSometimes, you have to let people fail.\u201dI often say \"Sometimes, you have to let the manager fail.\"Some managers don't like being told their ideas won't work. If you refuse or argue, you are seen as the reason his idea failed. I've found what works best with them is to proceed with the work, but keep them informed very frequently, so they can see how things evolve, and will be able to see the failure you had anticipated a long time ago before it is too late.Then you're seen in a positive light, and he'll separate you from the project failure.reply",

      "The paycheck?The vast majority of software projects fail. Honestly, I can't remember ever in my career working on a project I really believed in.Sometimes I do enjoy the challenge of doing the impossible. Turning a doomed project around or at least minimizing damage. I had some where I thought \"this worked out but if anyone but me had been in charge, yeah this would have been a disaster\". That feeds my ego. Though I never ever get any thanks from management or any praise. Though this is more of a German culture thing.There is a reason why burn out is so high in software dev. You are set up to constantly fail. If you succeed against all odds you get more and harder work until you fail.You got to focus on yourself and find joy in the little challenges. Don't fret over things that you can't change.reply",
      "I'd say it happens pretty frequently, when in a medium-large corp or larger.  The middle layers don't know what they're asking for, and don't listen to feedback, as a general statement.  They're just managers, not managers that are also technical experts.The paycheck is a big motivation, as is \"the rest of the work is enjoyable enough to overlook things I disagree with\". Work is rarely 100% aligned with every employee's thoughts, so I think this is actually normal.  Not ideal, obviously, but normal.It's why a hierarchy actually does make some sense - alignment is rarely perfect, so choosing a single path and saying \"everyone needs to get on board, that's why we pay you\" can in fact be better for everyone, rather than bikeshedding everything to death.  It can and very frequently does cause rather obvious severe problems, but it's capable of improving some things.reply",

We have done so much, for so long, with so little, we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.\"Fulfilling\" work is a rarity afforded by a fairly unique time and place in history. For the rest of us, work is a means to an end and ideally a fulfilling life outside work lets you keep plugging away on some rich idiot's hare brained scheme so you can keep living that fulfilling life outside work. 12 years in and I've not had a single project I worked on reach its own benchmark for success.
