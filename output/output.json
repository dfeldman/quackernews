      "I have an SCD30 which is a dual-channel NDIR sensor and am pretty happy with it. Once a year I\u2019ll take it outside to recalibrate it and it\u2019s never drifted more than a few ppm. I make sure to turn off the auto-calibration and manually calibrate it because auto-calibration can lead to weird behavior if you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing (it re-baselines the lowest observed ppm in a time window as 400ppm).\n \nreply",
      "FWIW, Sensirion's AEs told me they have empirical data showing that CO2 drops to outdoor levels at least once a week even in closed environments. Based on that they recommend using the auto calibration.Anecdotally, I see my CO2 levels hover around 600ppm inside even over night.\n \nreply",
      "I think that really depends on the environment it\u2019s deployed in.

Some TVOC sensors like the Sensirion SGP30 estimate CO2 via organic components in the air. When you breathe out, you add organic components to the air which these sensors pick up and try to calculate a corresponding CO2 ppm value. The problem is that also other indoor sources like deodorizers add these chemical components to the air and thus the estimated CO2 rises -even though nobody might be in the room. We strongly advise against using TVOC sensors for CO2 estimation and thus will also not analyse it further in the rest of this article.Both NDIR as well a"

      "If anything, this tool tracks with my general opinion on sentiment analysis: it would be awesome if it actually worked, but most algorithms just predict everything as neutral.For example if you search for bitwarden it ranks three comments as negative, all others as neutral. If I as a human look at actual comments about bitwarden [1] there are lots of comments about people using it and recommending it. As a human I would rate the sentiment as very positive, with some \"negative\" comments in between (that are really about specific situations where it's the wrong tool).I've had some success using LLMs for sentiment analysis. An LLM can understand context and determine that in the given context \"Bitwarden is the answer\" is a glowing recommendation, not a neutral statement. But doing sentiment analysis that way eats a lot of resources, so I can't fault this tool for going with the more established approach that is incapable of making that leap.1: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=pastMonth&page=0&prefix=tr...\n \nreply",

But at this point I thought that this style was one that \u201ccame and went\u201d before it saw any significant actual use in any apps or OSes. Maybe there is still hope after all :)Edit: oh and I had to try asking your tool for sentiment about neumorphic design after this of course. It returned my own comment lol :p and it called it \u201cneutral\u201d. Is it only evaluating the first paragraph that the word appears in in the comment? (Also I guess other people more commonly refer to it as \u201cneumorphism\u201d than as \u201cneumorphic design\u201d and maybe that\u2019s why when I asked it for neumorphic design it returned my own comment.)\n \nreply",

Stuff like [1] or [2]. And while I love skeumorphism, I hate those kinds of plastic interfaces. They always use the cheapest mushy buttons, and the pressable area of the buttons is always much smaller than what the printed buttons suggest. It's probably the one kind of physical interface I hate with a passion, and imitating it digitally doesn't evoke any positive feelings in me.Still better than making everything flat without shadows and making me guess where I can click, I guess.1: https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-finger-pressing-the-button...2: https://www.alamy.com/close-up-of-clothes-washing-machine-bu...Edit: just checked, this comment was analyzed as \"Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 79.56%)\" on the topic of \"neumorphic\"\n \nreply",

I've always enjoyed this style of design and was sad to see that it never picked up steam. I love how it seems to combine a digital Material design with a more physical and real feeling. I'm doing my part to bring it back.The tool definitely has some kinks in it that we have plans to iron out over time; we just wanted to get it in front of people to see if anybody would even like it.

The low contrast does not offer sufficient visual weight, making the experience not accessible. Additionally, it is difficult to determine clickability, as neumorphism is often used inconsistently on nonclickable and clickable elements.Don't get me wrong, I still like the design and I think it's cool, but I understand the reasons why it never got popular.\n \nreply",

      "I see your point, but I would disagree with you somewhat.Every new startup needs to navigate the transition from early adopters to bigger names and/or more mainstream users who give you credibility and higher revenue potential. But it\u2019s almost always done as a stepping stone approach. You need to get the early adopters first or else none of the rest matters.Doing this is not easy so any conceivable advantage is worth considering. Of course targeting build in public and indiehackers are not the only possible strategies for getting early users, but if it\u2019s working for you, don\u2019t underestimate how valuable that is.Of course I do agree about going into it with both eyes open and knowing that if you\u2019re successful enough, you will likely have to evolve somehow toward another customer segment.

      "I enjoyed reading this perspective, but I think it left out some crucial information. My thesis here is that the PSF - already woefully underfunded, with PyPI kept afloat by a massive in-kind donation that gets to stay off the books - grossly misallocates the funding it does receive. Further, there are obvious and serious gaps in the consideration they pay to the moral values they profess to hold most dear.> The PSF currently employs 12 full-time staff members. Members of the board do not directly manage the activities of the staff\u2014in fact board members telling staff what to do is highly inappropriate. Instead, the board is responsible for hiring an Executive Director\u2014currently Deb Nicholson...Ms. Nicholson is listed as both a board member and a staff member, and also an officer. Another staff member, Olivia Sauls, is also listed as an officer. Between officers, the board and staff, I count 25 unique individuals, who are presumably all paid.> Many PSF activities are carried out by these volunteers, in particular via Work Groups.The membership of these Work Groups also has heavy overlap. For example, four members of the Code of Conduct Work Group are on the Board as well - including Ms. Nicholson.It's also worth noting that members of Work Groups are not necessarily elected. For example, the cited charter for the new \"User Success\" Work Group doesn't provide for the addition or removal of members at all, even though it's intended to operate perpetually. The Code of Conduct Work Group appoints its members, who may apply by private contact.> You can see how that money has been spent in the 2023 Annual Impact Report.... The most significant categories of expenditure in 2023 were PyCon US ($1,800,000), our Grants program ($677,000), Infrastructure (including PyPI) ($286,000) and our Fiscal Sponsorees ($204,000)\u2014I\u2019ll describe these in more detail below.I can't readily find these numbers in the report, but I can find that staffing for 2023 cost a total of about 1.3 million.(The report for this year is, for some reason, only available in PDF format. Others pointed out that this was not great for accessibility - supposedly a core value of the PSF and several Work Groups - and this was agreed about, and then as far as I can tell nothing was done.)> More recently, the PSF has started employing Developers in Residence to directly support the work of both the core Python team and initiatives such as the Python Package Index.To my understanding, there are currently three of these: \u0141ukasz Langa - the individual who implemented my ban from the Python Discourse forum - since 2021, and Petr Viktorin and Serhiy Storchaka since January.That makes 28 likely people on the payroll by my count. Other core developers - dozens of them - operate purely on a volunteer basis. (In talks at PyCon, Raymond Hettinger used to joke about Guido van Rossum offering to double his $0 salary.)> PyPI\u2019s numbers are staggering. Today there are 570,000 projects consisting of 12,035,133 files, serving 1.9 billion downloads a day (that number from PyPI Stats). Bandwidth for these downloads is donated by Fastly, a PSF Visionary Sponsor who recently signed a five year agreement to continue this service.Per the report, this amounts to over 600 petabytes of network traffic from PyPI per year. This would cost about 12 million dollars a year - nearly triple the operating budget - at market rates (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/).My experiments suggest that about a quarter of this could be eliminated simply by enabling and then mandating the use of LZMA (XZ) compression for sdists and wheels (which currently must both use ordinary Gzip compression). There is support for LZMA in the Python standard library. (The one-time cost of recompressing existing archives should be minuscule in comparison - granted that LZMA is computationally expensive, but currently the daily download volume is on the order of dozens of times the entire repository size.)> The annual US Python Conference\u2014PyCon US\u2014is a big part of the PSF\u2019s annual activities and operations. With over 3,000 attendees each year (and a $1.8m budget for 2023) running that conference represents a full-time job for several PSF staff members.... the importance of PyCon US to the Python community is such that the PSF is happy to lose money running the event if necessary.For a sense of scale, this is 200 times the grant that made DjangoCon Africa possible - though it ran into serious issues due to underfunding (https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-...).Also for a sense of scale: the PyCon US Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@PyConUS) has about 29k subscribers and a total of 1.35 million views across all videos. For comparison, that's not many more people than those taking the JetBrains Python developer survey each year (e.g. https://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2023/ claims 25k), and less than a sixth as many views as for the question \"How do I list all files of a directory [in Python]?\" on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3207219/). But perhaps \"the Python community\" (with inclusivity as a core value) is meant to represent a much smaller group than Python developers in general.\n \nreply",
      "Board members of the PSF are not paid. We get to claim expenses on travel to PyCon and to the annual board retreat, but we're asked to see if our employer can foot the bill for those first (several do).Officers who are also PSF staff members are paid because they're staff members - officers who are not staff members aren't paid.Two of the current developers in residence are paid as PSF staff. One is paid as a contractor which I believe is because they don't live in the USA.The Fastly sponsorsip is indeed crucial to continuing to offer PyPI as a free resource. Having an infrastructure company sponsor that kind of thing makes a lot of sense, because their underlying costs are significantly less than if the PSF were to pay market prices for that bandwidth.The only direct PSF elections are for the board - different work groups have different governance structures, none of which involve elections as far as I know.Python core / steering council members are also elected but that's entirely separate from the PSF, see https://peps.python.org/pep-0013/$1.8m for a multi-day conference that supports 3,000+ attendees is pretty standard for North America.We made some significant changes to how grants work based on the feedback from DjangoCon Africa - details of those changes are here: https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/psf-board-update-on-imp...\n \nreply",

      "I was having some difficulty figuring out how Hy actually is translated to Python (and wasn't even sure if it was compiled or interpreted). Eventually I found on Wikipedia the following:\n> Hy is a dialect of the Lisp programming language designed to interact with Python by translating s-expressions into Python's abstract syntax tree (AST).Also, looking at the code on Github suggests this compiler is written in Python (see https://github.com/hylang/hy/blob/master/hy/compiler.py).I kind of wish this was made more clear on the main website. Perhaps, instead of introducing Hy as \"a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python\", introduce it as \"a Lisp dialect that compiles to Python's AST\". The words \"embedded in Python\" don't make it very clear just how it's embedded into Python. The various ways you can embed a Lisp look very different and have very different tradeoffs.For example, off the top of my head, I could \"embed\" a Lisp by writing an interpreter (in C if I care about performance) and letting it be called from Python, perhaps passing in a Python list instead of a string to make it more \"native\". Or I could \"embed\" a Lisp by compiling to Python bytecode. Or I could \"embed\" a Lisp by translating it directly to Python source code. Etc.Regardless, interesting project!\n \nreply",
      "From the readme / github page:> Hy is a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python. Since Hy transforms its Lisp code into Python abstract syntax tree (AST) objects, you have the whole beautiful world of Python at your fingertips, in Lisp form.\n \nreply",
      "The \"embed\" part stems from the fact that you can mix Python and Hy in a project with bi-directional calling. Works great, because it is all Python byte code in the end.\n \nreply",
      "> this compiler is written in PythonYes, that's right. Hy is not self-hosted.> The various ways you can embed a Lisp look very different and have very different tradeoffs.Hy itself provides options. Typically the process is that the Hy source code becomes Python AST objects, which Python then complies and executes, but you can also translate the Python AST objects into Python source text. Or you can use Python from Hy or vice versa: https://hylang.org/hy/doc/v1.0.0/interop\n \nreply",
      "The original hy annoucement makes it clear that they embed a Lisp by compiling with Python bytecode. You can see it in the following video about the 16:25 markhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1vui-LupKJI\n \nreply",

Hy is a Lisp dialect embedded in Python. See Hylang.org for an introduction and documentation, the NEWS file for a version history, and the HYPE POST for something a little less serious.Henceforth, breaking changes to documented parts of the language (other than dropping support for versions of Python that are themselves no longer supported by the CPython developers) will increase the major version number, and my intention is for that not to happen often, if at all. My focus will be on fixing new bugs as they arise, adding compatibility with new versions of Python, and adding support for whatever new features are added to Python in a fashion that won't break code that works on previous versions of Hy 1"
