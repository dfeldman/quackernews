      "Most biometrics aren't easily hidden from your environment, everyone's constantly leaving fingerprints and handprints all over everything, shedding skin cells and other DNA material, face and irises can be easily photographed.So it's kind of cool that a theoretical biometric could be stable over time and not easily leaked, that could take time to produce. Like some sort of cold storage biometric in the far future once certain biometrics become less useful after they're too easily lifted and replicated with new technology.

      "It's like reading \"A Discipline of Programming\", by Dijkstra. That morality play approach was needed back then, because nobody knew how to think about this stuff.Most explanations of ownership in Rust are far too wordy. See [1]. The core concepts are mostly there, but hidden under all the examples.    - Each data object in Rust has exactly one owner.\n      - Ownership can be transferred in ways that preserve the one-owner rule.\n      - If you need multiple ownership, the real owner has to be a reference-counted cell. \n        Those cells can be cloned (duplicated.)\n      - If the owner goes away, so do the things it owns.\n\n    - You can borrow access to a data object using a reference. \n      - There's a big distinction between owning and referencing.\n      - References can be passed around and stored, but cannot outlive the object.\n        (That would be a \"dangling pointer\" error).\n      - This is strictly enforced at compile time by the borrow checker.\n\nThat explains the model. Once that's understood, all the details can be tied back to those rules.[1] https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.htm...\n \nreply",
      "Summarizing a set of concepts in a way that feels correct and complete to someone who understands them, is a much easier task than explaining them to someone who doesn't. If we put this in front of someone who's only worked with call-by-sharing languages, do you think they'll get it right away? I'm skeptical.\n \nreply",
      "For me it really clicked when I realized ownership / lifetimes / references are just words used to talk about when things get dropped. Maybe because I have a background in C so I'm used to manual memory management. Rust basically just calls 'free' for you the moment something goes out of scope.All the jargon definitely distracted me from grasping that simple core concept.\n \nreply",
      "Right. If you come to Rust from C++ and can write good C++ code, you see this as \"oh, that's how to think about ownership\". Because you have to have a mental model of ownership to get C/C++ code to work.But if you come from Javascript or Python or Go, where all this is automated, it's very strange.\n \nreply",

Not a newbie tutorial, just straight to the point: why in-place mutability instead of other options, why encourage stack allocation, what problems with C++ does it solve and at what cost, etc.\n \nreply",
      "I think the major decisions behind Rust is being explicit and making the program make decisions earlier. No NULLs, no Implicit conversions, no dangling pointers.Stack allocation is faster to execute as there's a higher probability of it being cached.https://vnduongthanhtung.gitbooks.io/migrate-from-c-to-rust/...\n \nreply",

      "I don't think the idiom has in mind any particular curve. I think it's just another case of a misuse becoming idiomatic without any meaning beyond the phrase taken as a unit. E.g.- another think coming -> another thing coming- couldn't care less -> could care less- the proof of the pudding is in the eating -> the proof is in the puddingIt's usually not useful to try to determine the meaning of the phrases on the right because they don't have any. What does it mean for proof to be in a pudding for example?The idiom itself is fine, it's just a black box that compares learning something hard to climbing a mountain. But learning curves are real things that are still used daily so I just thought it was funny to talk as if a flat one was desirable.\n \nreply",

That\u2019s the most important lesson.Accept that learning Rust requires adopting a completely different mental model than what you\u2019re used to.\nThere are a ton of new concepts to learn like lifetimes, ownership, and the trait system.\nAnd depending on your background, you\u2019ll need to add generics, pattern matching, or macros to the list.Your learning pace doesn\u2019t have much to do with whether you\u2019re smart or not or if you have a lot of programming experience.\nInstead, what matters more is your attitude toward the language.I have seen junior devs excel at Rust with no prior training and senior engineers struggle for weeks/months or even give up entirely. Leave your hubris at home.Treat the borrow checker as a co-author, not an adversary. This reframes the relationship.\nL"

      "Really cool idea! Some improvements I'd recommend with the ultimate goal being \"getting users to learn the subject at hand\".1) Section Lectures on the left side need to be cleaned up, instead of just a numbered list. Seeing 30+ lectures off rip is a bit daunting, especially with no labeling, sectioning, etc. I'd imagine feeding a model a list of all the lecture titles, then having it structured should work?2) You're doing too much on the bottom section.You need to incorporate all those tabs into the single Ai tutor, which can run whatever tools required (maybe notes/discussion can be a small additional indication). No one's going to be using the Flashcards section, and it's calling probably the same LLM as the AI tutor, so might as well combine them.For the quiz, maybe when the video ends or the user wants to continue, the Ai Tutor goes into \"quiz mode\" forcing the user to attempt or pass the quiz (depending on the settings?).Think of this like Cursor but for Education. Cursors powerful agent can handle/do so much, you're not using 3-4 different fields.Oh and have it on the right side instead of transcript, so it's right there in users faces instead of having to scroll down.\n \nreply",
      "Great points. Definitely will improve the section lectures on the left, some formatting stuff to think about with the bottom section/transcript as well.Not completely sure about the AI tutor points though. I don't think the standard AI chat interface is the ideal form factor for the average person trying to learn something, and there's value in having pre-generated content that users can see instead of having to actively go to the tutor.Also, a lot of people do like using flashcards specifically to learn! Granted, our current implementation is pretty barebones so it's not super useful yet. And definitely agree that things can be cleaned up quite a bit.\n \nreply",

For example, setting up a hand plane and ways to mark a board you're working on.Do you use video comments in your context? I've (manually) scraped content on educational videos and built prompting to assess signal and incorporate what are likely important errata in LLM context.> video/resource \u2014> transcript/text \u2014>For this step in your pipeline, are you multi-modal? I mean, are you using the LLM to interpret what is shown in the video itself?  How is that content used?Do you have any sense for allowing people to generate educational content off arbitrary videos?\n \nreply",
      "For now we only use the YouTube transcript because for most educational content we've found it does about as well for lower cost.We may make that an option though, since we also offer other resource types (pdf, slides, docs) -> course.\n \nreply",
      "To your last question, what do you mean by arbitrary? If the video is not educational at all, then the generated course will likely not be good. If the video is pure entertainment then probably not a good use case.\n \nreply",
      "This is a fun concept, and I love the name!I\u2019m curious why you didn\u2019t use multiple choice for the exercises? I feel like those would be easier than typing out full answers and be closer to MOOC style homework. Maybe have a longer written question at the end of a section.The exercises work pretty well, I like the highlighting red wrong vs. green right. It does feel a bit like the MOOC-style discussions. The tutor doesn\u2019t just tell you the answers which is cool, but something about talking with the tutor feels a bit flat. And the flashcards weren\u2019t very helpful for the course I picked.I could see myself doing some courses like this with some more gamification. Being able to filter by course provider (Ycombinator, or MIT) would be cool too.\n \nreply",

Under the hood, the pdf reader used poppler, so I modified poppler to infer reading order in multicolumn documents using algorithms that tessaract's author (Thomas Breuel) had published for OCR.It was a bit of a heuristic hack; it was 20 years ago but as I recall poppler's ancient API didn't really represent text runs in a way you'd want for an accessibility API. A version of the multicolumn select made it in but it was a pain to try to persuade poppler's maintainer that subsequent suggestions to improve performance were ok - because they used slightly different heuristics so had different text selections in some circumstances. There was no 'right' answer, so wanting the results to match didn't make sense.And that's how kpdf got multicolumn select, of a sort.Using tessaract directly for this has probably made more sense for some years now.\n \nreply",

It still today diligently manages, and puts quite a lot of effort into constructing, a generated-on-the-fly TERMCAP environment variable, for example.* Attitudes to security have changed.

By Terence Tao9 May, 2025 in math.CA, math.LO | Tags: estimates, proof assistant, Software | by Terence Tao In a recent post, I talked about a proof of concept tool to verify estimates automatically.  Since that post, I have overhauled the tool twice: first to turn it into a rudimentary proof assistant that could also handle some propositional logic; and second into a much more flexible proof assistant (deliberately designed to mimic the Lean proof assistant in several key aspects) that is also powered by the extensive Python package sympy for symbolic algebra, following the feedback from previous commenters.  This I think is now a stable framework with which one can extend the tool much further; my initial aim was just to automate (or semi-automate) the proving of asymptotic estimates involving scalar functions, but in principle one could keep adding tactics, new sympy types, an"

      "> Why Not Just Use a Bucket Policy?I've heard these words so many times, it's refreshing to see someone dig into why bucket policies aren't a cure-all.As for \"Why not use synchronous deletion?\" \u2014 regarding the pitfall there, what about a WAL? I.e., you WAL the deletions you want to perform into an object in the object store, perform the deletions, and then delete the WAL. If you crash and find a WAL file, you repeat the delete commands contained in the WAL.(I've used this to handle this problem where some of the deletions are mixed: i.e., some in an object store, some in a SQL DB, etc. The object store is essentially being used as strongly consistent storage.)(Perhaps this is essentially the same as your \"delayed queue\"?

      "Another possible mechanism for doing GC at scale (a variation on Asynchronous Reconciliation in the article) in some file/object store, is doing a probabilistic mark and sweep using bloom filters.The mark phase can be done in parallel building many bloom filters for the files/objects found.Then the bloom filters are merged (or'ed together essentially) and then a parallel sweep phase can use the bloom filter to answer the question: is this file/object live?The bloom filter then answers either \"No\" with 100% certainty or \"Maybe\" with some probability p that depends on the parameters used for the bitset and the hash function family.\n \nreply",
      "What does the bloom filter solve?The expensive portion of the mark and sweep for the object store is the mark phase, not the storage of what's been marked.  100s, 1000s, or even millions of live objects wouldn't hardly take any space to keep in a remembered set.On the other hand, querying the S3 bucket to list those 1M objects would be expensive no matter how you store the results.But this does tickle my brain.  Perhaps something akin to the generational hypotheses can be applied?  Maybe it's the case that very old, very young, or very untouched objects are more likely to be garbage than not.  If there's some way to divide the objects up and only look at objects whose are in \"probably need to be collected\" regions, then you could do minor fast sweeps semi frequently and schedule more expensive \"really delete untracked stuff\" infrequently.\n \nreply",
