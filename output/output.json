How should we go about it?\n\nJapanese style\nOne way would be to use hanzi directly, asthe Japanese do.  For instance, we'd write \"work\" as , and \"ruler\" as .  Chinese and Japanese borrowings could be written using the original hanzi, e.g. \"gung-ho\" would be , and \"tycoon\" as .  \n\nYou can already see that this is going to be tricky.
