      "Pretty interesting approach to make an X server that is essentially \"Wayland-like\" (merging display server/compositor by default, isolated apps by default, no remoting of GLX, dropping legacy protocol features to the point of breaking compat with the core protocol, etc.). Not sure who this is for, but by itself it looks like a fairly reasonable set of choices.reply",
      "For people who absolutely have to have X11 this looks like a better plan than XLibre.reply",
      "It depends on whether their reasons for \"absolutely having to have X11\" hinge on actual compatibility with e.g. old binaries or wanting full remoting without streaming pixels.This project would satisfy people who really actually want Wayland, but were upset by transitional pains or interactions they had around it and want to stick with X11 just-cause while getting some similar benefits. This arguably does describe some people but not sure it's a whole lot in the long run.But who knows, maybe this could also make an easier to maintain XWayland some day, or a nice basis for implementing more esoteric X11 bits down the road vs. the older Xorg codebase.reply",
      "I don't \"actually want Wayland\" because I want the simplicity of X and the ability to run my own wm, but I have no need for legacy X11 requests, for some values of \"legacy\". Whether this will become viable for me remains to be seen, but I need very little from my X11 server.reply",
      "Fair! Though I'm actually not sure I understand what you mean with simplicity. X11 is so vastly more complicated than Wayland.reply",
      "For the server/compositor.Not for the client, or if you want to write a wm and is forced to write a compositor.And actually I'm not even even convinced about the server if talking about a minimal server like this that insists on DRI/GBM, and ditches all the old rendering cruft.reply",
      "Wayland made writing WMs needlessly hard, and the benefits of Wayland were frankly not real - most of the reasons given in 2011 were patched in to X11 later. All the Wayland rewrite got us was a situation where Wayland is both bleeding-edge and obsolete simultaneously. Say what you like about X11, but by the time people unironically pushed for mass Wayland adoption, X11 was stable and boringly so.The future of WMs is, IMO, Arcan - https://arcan-fe.com/ - but that's an ambitious project and I don't blame the main developer for deliberately going out of his way to avoid advertising it before it's ready. In the meanwhile, Wayland and X11 both more-or-less work with the occasional major pain in the ass.reply",
      "Long term if x11 starts having issues then probably https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayback/wayback will be itreply",
      "The people who absolutely have to have X11 like myself usually have reasons. It sounds like currently a lot of those reasons for using X11 would prevent using this X server. Like reliable non-fragmented and widely supported screenreader protocol. Or the ability to do keyboard and mouse sharing.>Applications will be isolated from each other by default and can only interact with other applications either through a GUI prompt asking for permission, such as with screen recorders, where it will only be allowed to record the window specified or by explicitly giving the application permission before launched (such as a window manager or external compositor).reply",
      "Accessibility? Sure. Everything else? Nah, I'm sorry. There are countless ways to do remoting with Wayland. There are countless ways to do kb+mouse sharing.reply"

    "first_paragraph": "Phoenix is a new X server, written from scratch in Zig (not a fork of Xorg server). This X server is designed to be a modern alternative to the Xorg server.Phoenix is not ready to be used yet. At the moment it can render simple applications that do GLX, EGL or Vulkan graphics (fully hardware accelerated) nested in an existing X server.\nRunning Phoenix nested will be the only supported mode until Phoenix has progressed more and can run real-world applications.Be a simpler X server than the Xorg server by only supporting a subset of the X11 protocol, the features that are needed by relatively modern applications (applications written in the last ~20 years).\nOnly relatively modern hardware (made in the last ~15 years) which support linux drm and mesa gbm will be supported, and no server driver interface like the Xorg server. Just like how Wayland compositors work.Be safer than the Xorg server by parsing protocol messages automatically. As it's written in Zig, it also automatically catches"

It could be \"out of distribution\", similar to what Karpathy said about writing his end-to-end pedagogical LLM chatbot---Now that I think of it, Bellard would probably train his own LLM on his own code!  The rest of the world's code might not help that much :-)He has all the knowledge to do that ...

If you look at the OWASP cheat sheet today you will see that Fetch Metadata is a top-level alternative to the traditional token-based protection.I'm not sure I understand why, but the cheat sheet page was modified twice.

      "I find that cookie setting really confusing. It means that cookies will only be respected on requests that originated on the site that set them... but that includes when you click links from one site to another.So if you follow a link (e.g. from a Google search) to a site that uses SameSite=Strict cookies you will be treated as logged out on the first page that you see!

But then I bumped into a new way some people are dealing with CSRF attacks that is way simpler, which I describe below.An often shared piece of advice is that you should never implement security features yourself.

      "Fun fact with arrow notation, if you put it under a modulus it quickly converges to the same value no matter how high in exponents you go!Eg. 2^2^2 = 2^4 mod 35 = 16Let's go one higher2^2^2^2 = 2^16 mod 35 = 16 too!and once more for the record2^2^2^2^2 = 2^65536 mod 35 = 16 as well. It'll keep giving this result no matter how high you go.https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=2%5E2%5E2%5E2+mod+35 for a link of this to play with.I could do this with any modulus and any exponent too.2^3^3 = 2^3^3^3 = 7 mod 11 etc.The reason is that the orders of powers are effected by the totient recursively and since totients always reduce, eventually the totient converges to 1. This is where the powers no longer matter under modulus. Eg. the totient of 35 is 12 (the effective modulo of the first order power), the totient of 12 is 2 (the effective modulo of the second order power), the totient of 2 is 1 (the effective modulo of the third order power) and so after 3 powers under mod 35 it converges.reply",

Compiler optimizations fall into two categories:1. organized data flow analysis2. recognizing a pattern and replacing it with a faster versionThe first is very effective over a wide range of programs and styles, and is the bulk of the actual transformations.

As mentioned elsewhere \"Everyone knows the Gauss Summation formula for sum of n integers i.e. n(n+1)/2\" and since everyone knows it why not just write that instead of the loop!Of course one could say that for any pattern, like replacing i*2 with i<<1, but those pattern replacements are very valuable because they are generated by high level generic coding.And you could say I'm just being grumpy about this because my optimizer does not do this particular optimization.

      "If this had been available in 2010, Redis scripting would have been JavaScript and not Lua. Lua was chosen based on the implementation requirements, not on the language ones... (small, fast, ANSI-C). I appreciate certain ideas in Lua, and people love it, but I was never able to like Lua, because it departs from a more Algol-like syntax and semantics without good reasons, for my taste. This creates friction for newcomers. I love friction when it opens new useful ideas and abstractions that are worth it, if you learn SmallTalk or FORTH and for some time you are lost, it's part of how the languages are different. But I think for Lua this is not true enough: it feels like it departs from what people know without good reasons.reply",
      "I don't love a good deal of Lua's syntax, but I do think the authors had good reasons for their choices and have generally explained them. Even if you disagree, I think \"without good reasons\" is overly dismissive.Personally though, I think the distinctive choices are a boon. You are never confused about what language you are writing because Lua code is so obviously Lua. There is value in this. Once you have written enough Lua, your mind easily switches in and out of Lua mode. Javascript, on the other hand, is filled with poor semantic decisions which for me, cancel out any benefits from syntactic familiarity.More importantly, Lua has a crucial feature that Javascript lacks: tail call optimization. There are programs that I can easily write in Lua, in spite of its syntactic verbosity, that I cannot write in Javascript because of this limitation. Perhaps this particular JS implementation has tco, but I doubt it reading the release notes.I have learned as much from Lua as I have Forth (SmallTalk doesn't interest me) and my programming skill has increased significantly since I switched to it as my primary language. Lua is the only lightweight language that I am aware of with TCO. In my programs, I have banned the use of loops. This is a liberation that is not possible in JS or even c, where TCO cannot be relied upon.In particular, Lua is an exceptional language for writing compilers. Compilers are inherently recursive and thus languages lacking TCO are a poor fit (even if people have been valiantly forcing that square peg through a round hole for all this time).Having said all that, perhaps as a scripting language for Redis, JS is a better fit. For me though Lua is clearly better than JS on many different dimensions and I don't appreciate the needless denigration of Lua, especially from someone as influential as you.reply",
      "> For me though Lua is clearly better than JS on many different dimensions and I don't appreciate the needless denigration of Lua, especially from someone as influential as you.Is it needless?  It's useful specifically because he is someone influential, and someone might say \"Lua was antirez's choice when making redis, and I trust and respect his engineering, so I'm going to keep Lua as a top contender for use in my project because of that\" and him being clear on his choices and reasoning is useful in that respect.  In any case where you think he has a responsibility to be careful what he says because of that influence, that can also be used in this case as a reason he should definitely explain his thoughts on it then and now.reply",
      "Formally JavaScript is specified as having TCO as of ES6, although for unfortunate and painful reasons this is spec fiction - Safari implements it, but Firefox and Chrome do not. Neither did QuickJS last I checked and I don't think this does either.reply",
      "ES is now ES2025, not ES6/2015.  There are still platforms that don't even fully implement enough to shim out ES5 completely, let alone ES6+.  Portions of ES6 require buy in from the hosting/runtime environment that aren't even practical for some environments... so I feel the statement itself is kind of ignorant.reply",
      "> I think the distinctive choices are a boon. You are never confused about what language you are writing because Lua code is so obviously Lua. There is value in this.This. And not just Lua , but having different kind of syntax for scripting languages or very high level languages signal it is something entirely different, and not C as in system programming language.The syntax is also easier for people who dont intend to make programming as their profession, but simply want something done. It used to be the case in the old days people would design simple PL for new beginners, ActionScript  / Flash era and even Hypercard before that. Unfortunately the industry is no longer interested in it, and if anything intend to make every as complicated as possible.reply",

      "My experience is that anything involving Bazel is slow, bloated, and complicated, hammers your disk, copies your files ten times over, and balloons your disk usage without ever collecting the garbage. A lot of essential features are missing so you realistically have to build a lot of custom rules if not outright additional tooling on top.I'm not too surprised that out of the box docker images exhibit more of this. While it's good they're fixing it, it feels like maybe some of the core concepts cause pretty systematic issues anytime you try to do anything beyond the basic feature set...reply",

      "To be clear, when you say \u201cthey\u2019re fixing this\u201d\u2026the Bazel maintainers have nothing to do with this.Bazel is a general purpose tool like Make. But with caching and sandboxing and different syntax.Make is no less focused on Docker than Bazel is.Unlike Make however, Bazel does make it easy to share rule sets.But you don\u2019t need to use other people\u2019s Bazel rule sets any more than you need to use other people\u2019s Make recipes.This author has a clever way to minimize needing to touch layers at all.reply",
      "rules_oci (and bunch of rules_* under bazelbuild / bazel-contrib org on GitHub) is Bazel recommeded rule sets.I don't agree with your parent comment about Bazel, but your comment is not fair too. Bazel tries to be better build tool so it took on responsibility on registry / rules_* and get critics for it is a fair game.The \"bloated Bazel\" blame is not fair too, but I think somewhat understandable. If you ever going to only do JavaScript, bun or other package manager is enough and \"lighter-weight\". Same goes to uv + Python bundle. Bazel only shines if you are dealing with your C++ mess and even there, people prefer CMake for reasons beyond me.reply",
      "I'm struggling with the caching right now. I'm trying to switch from the Github actions to just running stuff in containers, and it works. Except for caching.Buildkit from Docker is just a pure bullshit design. Instead of the elegant layer-based system, there's now two daemons that fling around TAR files. And for no real reason that I can discern. But the worst thing is that the caching is just plain broken.reply",
      "I went down this rabbit hole before, you have to ignore all the recommended approaches. The real solution is to have a build server with a global Docker install and a script to prune cache when the disk usage goes above a certain percentage. Cache is local and instant. Pushing and pulling cache images is an insane solution.reply",
      "The layers are tar files, I\u2019m confused what behavior you actually want that isn\u2019t supported.reply",
      "The original Docker (and the current Podman) created each layer as an overlay filesystem. So each layer was essentially an ephemeral container. If a build failed, you could actually just run the last successful layer with a shell and see what's wrong.More importantly, the layers were represented as directories on the host system. So when you wanted to run something in the final container, Docker just needed to reassemble it.Buildkit has broken all of it. Now building is done, essentially, in a separate system, the \"docker buildx\" command talks with it over a socket. It transmits the context, and gets the result back as an OCI image that it then needs to unpack.This is an entirely useless step. It also breaks caching all the time. If you build two images that differ only slightly, the host still gets two full OCI artifacts, even if two containers share most of the layers.It looks like their Bazel infrastructure optimized it by moving caching down to the file level.reply",
      "Buildkit didn't break anything here except that it each individual build step is no longer exposed as a runnable image in docker.\nThat was unfortunate, but you can actually have buildkit run a command in that filesystem these days, and buildx now even exposes a DAP interface.Buldkit is far more efficient than the old model.reply",
      "Buildkit is still a separate system, unlike the old builder. So you get that extra step of importing the result back.And since it's a separate system, there are also these strange limitations. For example, I can't just cache pre-built images in an NFS directory and then just push them into the Buildkit context. There's simply no command for it. Buildkit can only pull them from a registry.> Buldkit is far more efficient than the old model.I've yet to see it work faster than podman+buildah. And it's also just plain buggy. Caching for multi-stage and/or parallel builds has been broken since the beginning. The Docker team just ignores it and closes the bugs:\nhttps://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1981\nhttps://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/2274\nhttps://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/2279I understand why. I tried to debug it, and simply getting it running under a debugger is an adventure.So far, I found that switching to podman+podman-compose is a better solution. At least my brain is good enough to understand them completely, and contribute fixes if needed.reply"

The app is already built by Bazel, so you just need to package it into an image with the right base layers and configuration. This should be quick. Bazel is good at this sort of thing.
