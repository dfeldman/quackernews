      "I wrote this after a bad week at a previous job trying to get an Android device to work with a CDC Ethernet adapter.Since writing this, a couple people have let me know that there is a particular bit in the MAC address, that if flipped, will cause the kernel to assign an `ethX` name instead of `usbX` name. I haven't tried it myself or updated the post with that information because I moved on to a different job, and Android devices are no longer a large part of my life.Of course, that only helps if you have a CDC device where you're in control of the MAC address (i.e. maybe another Linux device pretending to be a CDC adapter)\n \nreply",

Otherwise, buckle in, we\u2019re going debugging; this post is mostly about my thought process and techniques I used to arrive at the answer rather than the answer itself.Android contains support for USB ethernet adapters. There\u2019s even menus for them!This means that if you very carefully select a USB Ethernet adapter that you know has a chipset compatible with your Android device, you can plug it in and these settings will spring to life. How do you know what chipsets are compatible with your phone?Hearsay!I\u2019m not entirely kidding. If the company that you bought your phone from sells a USB ethernet adapter as an accessory to it, you have a pretty good chance of that one working. Otherwise, it\u2019s hit-or-miss; phone manufacturers rarely, if ever, publish lists of supported Ethernet adapters.

      "I couldn't get an email or post to work correctly to the author, so hoping they find this.Thank you to the shout out to my father, Preston Fleet, for his work on developing Omnimax and everything is the article is factually correct. He died young after also building Fotomat and WD40 (and funding the Cabaret movie, for which he shared an Oscar).  He shied away from the spotlight and named everything after his contributors because he was kind. And a totally shock the author knew about his presidency at the American Theatre Organ Society, which my mother followed after his death. Unfortunate selfish to say in a public forum, but really just want to thank the article's author in some way\n \nreply",
      "Thanks! email to me@computer.rip should work, sorry if it has given you trouble. Theater organs are one of my weird little interests, so maybe it's a leap but when I saw a tangential mention that Preston Fleet had been a theater organist some of the dramatic design features of many Omnimax theaters (like the glass-walled projection rooms and displaying the speakers in the preshow) made more sense to me. They're similar to the way many theater organs were installed, especially as they started to become such a niche instrument.\n \nreply",
      "I spent a great deal of time at Reuben H. Fleet as a kid growing up in San Diego, playing in the science museum and watching whatever Omnimax movie was on. Didn't matter what it was, they were almost always great eye candy. Even saw, later, a Pink Floyd-themed laser light show projected on the dome. Never failed to impress.\n \nreply",

      "Given the expense of running a proper Omnimax theater and the lack of new content to keep it going, it seems like the only way Omnimax can be properly preserved in the long term is through VR.\n \nreply",
      "I was surprised to see a mention of the Carnegie Science Center's Omnimax and the year 1978 -- my recollection was that this theater didn't open until I  was both alive and cognizant enough of the world around me to remember it.That seems consistent with this announcement from 2017 that the theater was going to close (citing a quarter century): https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/rangos-omnimax-theater-to...I couldn't find any press covering it from 1978, although this directory of IMAX/Omnimax theaters from 1992 matches my recollection of it opening in ~1991.\n \nreply",
      "I think you're right, I mixed up some different locations. Here's the cool thing: while I was checking that against newspaper archives I happened to run across an older version of an illustration I saw used in the '90s, but the older version has a more complete caption! It confirms that the Science Museum of Minnesota installation was at least planned to have a Spitz STS like the Fleet. I'll see if I can tell if it was ever installed or not. I've been unsure of whether or not the Fleet was the only example of a combined Omnimax/planetarium.The same illustration appeared with announcements of some other Omnimax theaters, but I suspect it had just been copied from the Minnesota design without paying much attention. The captions never mention the STS.However, the side control booth located about halfway up the house, which is present in all of the Omnimax theaters where I've been able to check, is labeled as the \"Planetarium console.\" This could explain the curiosity of the '90s Omnimax theaters having two different control booths. It seems odd to keep that feature without the planetarium projector.\n \nreply",

I iterate on these plan documents by having Claude write QUESTIONS.md which has dev questions for me to clarify, which I fill out with answers, and then instruct Claude to update the plan docs with my answers. Then most of my interaction throughout the day is just saying something like \"P18\" to implement implementation plan step #18. I instruct it in CLAUDE.md to stop after each step, output what automated tests have been written for P18's features, and I require that the LLM write a demo script that I can run that shows the features, using real APIs.

      "I do not find her critique of argument #2 compelling [1]. Monetization of AI is key to economic growth. She's focused on the democratic aspects of AI, which frankly aren't pertinent. The real \"race\" in AI is between economic and financial forces, with huge infrastructure investments requiring a massive return on investment to justify the expense. From this perspective, increasing the customer base and revenue of the company is the objective. Without this success, investment in AI will drop, and with it, company valuations.The essay attempted to mitigate this by noting OAI is nominally a non-profit. But it's clear the actions of the leadership are firmly aligned with traditional capitalism. That's perhaps the only interesting subtly of the issue, but the essay missed this entirely. The omission could not have been intentional, because it provides a complete motivation for item #2.[1] #2 is 'The US is a democracy and China isn\u2019t, so anything that helps the US \u201cwin\u201d the AI \u201crace\u201d is good for democracy.'\n \nreply",

The way it functions is that it is used in DNA replication, but then doesn\u2019t work, and the daughter cells die.Typically, patients who get this drug experience a lot of adverse effects, including a highly suppressed immune system and risk of serious infections.I researched whether there was a circadian rhythm in replication of either the cancer cells or the immune cells: lymphocyte and other progenitors, and found papers indicating that the cancer cells replicated continuously, but the progenitor cells replicated primarily during the day.Based on this, we arranged for him to get the chemotherapy infusion in the evening, which took some doing, and the result was that his immune system was not suppressed in the subsequent rounds of chemo given using that schedule.His doctor was very impressed, but said that since there was no clinical study, and it was inconvenient to do this, they would not be changing their protocol for other patients.This was around 1995.\n \nreply",

Wikipedia's much more helpful: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EruvBasically if you are an observant Jew then you are forbidden from doing work on Saturdays. There are some extremely specific rules about what \"work\" is. One kind of forbidden work is taking things outside of your house; the eruv symbolically turns most of the city into \"home\" so you can do things like, say, take your baby for a weekend stroll on a nice day or walk outside with a cane. It's more nuanced than this, there's a whole bunch of rules about what you can't do and about how big an eruv can be and what you have to do to make it valid.(I am not Jewish so do not ask me for any further details on this.)\n \nreply",
      "My Jewish friend once told me, specifically discussing this wire, that Jews consider finding loopholes in their own rules a national pastime.

Exact interpretation of that text is then debated by religious scholars, but the meaning of the words is entirely contained in the text.For Christians and those raised in the Christian tradition, this is entirely foreign. The rules are not set out nearly as strictly for you, you have to interpret them much more broadly.Generally, if you read their respective books, the old testament has a set of rules mixed in with a quasi-historical context, while the new testament is almost entirely in the form of parables.Islam, by the way, goes back toward the Jewish legalistic idea.\n \nreply"

At this rate of development, I wouldn't be surprised if hot code swapping was functional within a year on x86_64.The biggest pain point I personally have with Zig right now is the speed of `comptime` - The compiler has a lot of work to do here, and running a brainF** DSL at compile-time is pretty slow (speaking from experience - it was a really funny experiment).

In reality there are 2084 behavior tests, but the extra ones there are generally redundant with LLVM\u2019s own test suite for its own x86 backend, so we only run those when testing with self-hosted x86.

      "Harp player here. When I first started playing, I had a Gindick's book, Country and Blues Harmonica For the Musically Hopeless. This was maybe 35 years ago. I would recommend that book and the tape (cd? mp3?) that comes with it, for beginners.\nYou can't see the notes you are playing on a harmonica. You have to hear them. You start by playing clear single notes and then shaping the note by articulating eeeh-yah or something similar and the note magically bends. You have to hear the note so you can tell if the note bends. It is very organic, and I don't think an app will help much. It may confirm what is happening, but it is not going to help if you can't do it.\nPersonally, I played along with Little Walter's greatest hits on my hour long morning commute, and eventually it was just natural to bend the notes at the right time.\nMy advice is to look for Jason Ricci on YouTube. He has hundreds or thousands of videos on beginner to advanced subjects. He is a weird dude, but I've never known a better teacher.\n \nreply",
      "I also learned from that book + tape about 30 years ago.  I also have to strongly agree with this.  It's quite different from learning stringed instruments.  I'm sure it has a lot in common with some brass instruments, but either way, seeing doesn't help.  Hearing and feeling is everything.  That also makes it easier than most to learn via cassette tape! :)The app seems neat, but focused on precision in bending. Precision in bends doesn't matter a ton for most styles.  It's more about feel.  Build and resolve tension.  Don't worry too much about hitting things exactly.  That advice will eventually fail you if you go into styles that need a more complete scale, but for blues/rock/country, it's much more about intuition than precision.  The best way to learn is to play along with a lot of things and build \"feel\" instead of trying to precisely hit notes.  (though you do need to hit a clean note to start bending)\n \nreply",
      "This is very nice, thank you for creating it. I have a few suggestions, but they will have to wait until later this week. I see an email address on the Imprint page on your website - is that the best way to reach you?Somewhat related, for any harmonica player who likes to play cross harp for that bluesy sound, and wants to branch out into songs written in a major or natural minor key (e.g. much pop/rock/country), let me suggest the Melody Maker tuning. This gives you a major scale (along with the relative minor) all up and down the harp in the cross harp position.And you can still bend notes. You just don't have to for the major/minor scale notes.For example, a High C Melody Maker is perfect for playing Stevie Nicks' vocal in Dreams. The song is in A minor, but the A minor harps from Lee Oskar and Seydel are in a lower register. The High C matches her range.The song begins with \"Now here you go again\", and Stevie has a signature vocal bend on the word \"go\". She starts that word nearly a semitone flat and then slides up to pitch.On the Melody Maker, that note is on the draw 3, where it is super fun and easy to start with a light bend to mimic her vocal style.The nice thing is that you don't have to be so precise on your pitch with this bend. You just start low and slide up, like Stevie does.I used to make my own Melody Makers by retuning a conventional Richter harp. You raise the blow 2 by a full step to get the second note in the major scale, and raise the draw 5 and draw 9 by a half step to get the minor 7ths. So an F Richter harp becomes a High C Melody Maker and is labeled that way when you buy one.For years, Lee Oskar only sold Melody Makers in five keys, but now they have expanded it to nine keys including the High C and the Bb that I use for the late Songbird's vocal on You Make Loving Fun.Seydel has always sold their Melodic Maker (same as Melody Maker) in all 13 keys, but their cover design is so different from Lee Oskar and Hohner that I never could switch back and forth without off-by-one-note errors.(Yes, 13 keys, because there is both a Low C and a High C.)Oh - how do you retune a harmonica? File the reeds! File off some weight at the tip and it raises the pitch. Scratch off some weight at the attached end and it lowers the pitch. You just need a single edge razor blade to lift the reed out of its slot, a fine point file or other small file, and an instrument tuner like Let's Bend.\n \nreply",
      "Very interesting! I've played harp casually all my life without ever really learning about alternate tunings. The Melody Maker sounds like it would open some nifty possibilities! Someone bought me a chromatic harp once as a gift and I could never figure out how to play it properly. It's funny though, because as a piano and guitar player I never thought about what I was doing. I just play a cheap blues band or marine band, and I realize now that the positions that feel most normal to me are 1st, 2nd and oddly, 12th. I remember once jamming with an old folk rocker (my former guitar teacher) and he started playing something in F major while I was on a C harp. He didn't think I'd be able to follow - at the time, I just called this \"cross harp\" because I thought that was the generic term for playing in any other key! I don't know why playing in a major 4th seems so unusual, but he was kinda shocked that I pulled it off. There's only one note you can't play straight in that setup...\n \nreply",
      "Bending takes a bit of practice but it\u2019s not terribly hard. Here are some general tips for absolute beginners that are based simply on my anecdotal experience as an amateur player:1. Don\u2019t start with a wooden harp like marine band. The metal and plastic ones are typically a bit easier to bend.2. One hole at a time. Ensure you can exclusively blow in a single hole to practice3. Lower notes are generally easier to bend than higher notes4. Make an O with your mouth and have the tongue float in the middle. Start by pulling, not pushing, in my experience bending on intake is slightly easier than bending on blowing out.5. Tighten the lips and decrease the size of the O to increase pull force on the reed to create a bending effect, and also tighten the airflow chamber above your tongue by pulling your tongue back and up, then loosen it by moving your tongue forward and downThis tool looks great for helping improve once you\u2019ve been able to perform the initial bend. Excited to try it out!\n \nreply",
      "I disagree with (1) and (3). I think for a novice bending low notes is more difficult. For me the easiest note to bend was hole 6 on a C harmonica. Also, I don't think wood vs plastic matters for how easy bending is.\n \nreply",
      "> Lower notes are generally easier to bend than higher notesOne thing to note (pun intended) is that you can only bend the higher of the two notes in a hole. On the lower half of the harmonica, those are the draw notes. But the upper octave switches these around. The blow notes are the higher ones there, and those are the ones you can bend.\n \nreply",
      "> you can only bend the higher of the two notes in a holeDo you know why that is?\n \nreply",
      "> Don\u2019t start with a wooden harp like marine band. The metal and plastic ones are typically a bit easier to bend.OTOH I find the Marine Band Crossover (with a bamboo comb) to be probably the best bending harp out there due to it receiving detailed factory setup.> Lower notes are generally easier to bend than higher notesAdditionally, you'll probably find a lower key harp to bend better, at least to a point. I feel like an A harp is the sweet spot for bending really well without being so low that it starts becoming difficult. G harps are good too, but require you to dig deeper to get a good bend.\n \nreply",
      "This is the best explanation I've found of the mechanics of pitch bending https://youtu.be/Fp-GxEaChr0?si=-E9uDTQx51gtnd9CEssentially, match the size of the resonance chamber in your mouth to the note you're trying to bend to. This is different for every note you bend. You can find the right size by making \"hissing\" noises while breathing in (without harmonica)  and matching the pitch.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": " For beginners, bending notes on a harmonica is a big hurdle. It requires a lot of time through regular practice. By bending, even the semitones can be sounded on the harmonica through special drawing and blowing techniques, which cannot be reached by regular playing of the channels. Beginners ask themselves, \"Is that bending now or is the semitone exactly hit?\"  The lean and performant Lets' Bend app makes it easy and fun for anyone to master the art of bending. By visualising the notes you play, you'll be bending like a pro in no time.  A short video about the functionality is published here: The original idea in developing the Let's Bend app was to create an application that is available on all common operating systems and whose application window scales well. It is not uncommon to have other applications open while practising or to want to use the programme on different devices.

      "No, the integral cannot be \"expressed\" as a sum over weights and function evaluations (with a \"=\"), it can be approximated with this idea. If you fix any n+1 nodes, interpolate your function, and integrate your polynomial, you will get this sum where the weights are integrals over (Lagrange) basis polynomials. By construction, you can compute the integral of polynomials up to degree n exactly. Now, if you choose the nodes in a particular way (namely, as the zeros of some polynomials), you can increase this to up to 2n+1. What I'm getting at is that the Gaussian integration is not estimating the integrals of polynomials of degree 2n+1, but it's evaluating them exactly.\n \nreply",

      "Fig 1 could use a rethink. It uses log scale, but the dynamic range of the y-axis is tiny, so the log transform isn't doing anything.It would be better shown as a table with 3 numbers. Or, maybe two columns, one for integral value and one for error, as you suggest.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah - my guess is this was just a very roundabout solution for setting axis limits.(For some reason, plt.bar was used instead of plt.plot, so the y axis would start at 0 by default, making all results look the same. But when the log scale is applied, the lower y limit becomes the data\u2019s minimum. So, because the dynamic range is so low, the end result is visually identical to having just set y limits using the original linear scale).Anyhow for anyone interested the values for those 3 points are 2.0000 (exact), 1.9671 (trapezoid), and 1.9998 (gaussian). The relatives errors are 1.6% vs. 0.01%.\n \nreply",

In this blog, we'll look at a numerical integration technique called gaussian quadrature, specifically chebyshev-gauss quadrature. This is applicable for evaluating definite integrals over [\u22121,1][-1,1][\u22121,1] and with a special functional form - we'll also look into how we can tweak an generic function over an arbitrary interval to fit this form.At it's core, gaussian quadrature gives us a way to evaluate a definite integral of a function by using the function evaluations at special points called nodes, the exact location of which can vary depending on the technique used - we'll look at a specific example using chebyshev nodes later on. Here's the basic idea for a definite integral over [\u22121,1][-1,1][\u22121,1], we'll extend this to an arbitrary interval [a,b][a,b][a,b] later on. An integral of fff can be expressed as a weighted sum of fff evaluated at nnn nodes :\u222b\u221211f(x)dx=\u2211i=1nw("
