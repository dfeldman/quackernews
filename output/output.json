      "It's a little weird to me that getaddrinfo() is considered a \"low-level legacy API\".  Maybe things are drastically different on macOS, but getaddrinfo() is the way to resolve names on Linux and I suspect the *BSDs.Sure, I expect most macOS apps will use something in Foundation or some other NetworkKit-type framework to do DNS queries, but it's odd to me that the code there wouldn't then call down to getaddrinfo() or the like to do the dirty work.  I guess GAI is blocking, so presumably there's some other low-level non-blocking call?\n \nreply",
      ">so presumably there's some other low-level non-blocking callCorrect, CFNetwork is open source so you can check implementation but last I remember it used some variant like `getaddrinfo_async`. But Apple really doesn't want you (the end-user) to use getaddrinfo (or the async variant CF exposes) to resolve an IP and then directly connect() via that ip, everything is geared towards connect-by-hostname since then Apple's can internally handle the implementation of happy-eyeballs.Edit: You can read https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/72/slides/plenaryw-6.pdf for their thoughts on why they don't like the getaddrinfo() model [there are speaker notes at the bottom of each slide]\n \nreply",

People just assume that glibc is how things are done in Linux user space but it doesn't have to be that way. For example, systemd came up with its own resolved mechanism which turned out to be much better than the glibc stuff.

    "first_paragraph": "When you enter a hostname in your web browser (e.g., apple.com), that name must first be translated into an IP address so your computer can connect to the server. This lookup is usually performed unencrypted, meaning your Internet provider and other parties monitoring your connection can see which sites you visit. To protect these lookups from prying eyes, Little Snitch 6 offers a new feature: DNS encryption. With DNS encryption enabled, all name lookups are routed through Little Snitch and performed in encrypted form.For this purpose, Little Snitch registers a DNS proxy. macOS then sends all DNS requests to that proxy, which in turn performs the lookup in encrypted form. The key point here is that all requests must be routed through the proxy.While investigating a DNS-related issue on macOS 15 Sequoia, we discovered that some DNS requests\u2014particularly those made via certain low-level legacy APIs\u2014were not being received by our proxy!There appears to be a bug in macOS Sequoia causing so"

GraalPy provides experimental support for this API, which allows many packages like NumPy and PyTorch to work well for many use cases. The support extends only to the API, not the binary interface (ABI), so extensions built for CPython are not binary compatible with GraalPy. Packages that use the native API must be built and installed with GraalPy, and the prebuilt wheels for CPython from pypi.org cannot be used. For best results, it is crucial that you only use the pip command that comes preinstalled in GraalPy virtualenvs to install packages. The version of pip shipped with GraalPy applies additional patches to packages upon installation to fix known compatibility issues and it is preconfigured to use an additional repository from graalvm.org where we publish a selection of prebuilt wheels for GraalPy.

      "> The obvious loss is to government revenue, but the more subtle and still very real loss is the diversion of high-powered talent from what could have been gains in efficiency and productivity to focus instead on corporate reorganizations and tax evasion games.It's also a loss to all of us who find ourselves owning a \"foreign\" corporation for legitimate reasons, and having to do a lot of work proving that we're not playing shell games.I'm an American living in the UK; I've started what's now a one-man bootstrapped company and it just makes sense for it to be incorporated in the UK.  I don't mind paying taxes, but I don't want to have to pay them twice.  UK taxes are generally higher than US taxes, and there are tax treaties to avoid double taxation, so no problem, right?Wrong.  First, if a US citizen owns more than 10% of a foreign corporation, there's an insanely complicated form you have to fill out, two pages of which are incomprehensible questions (\"Is your company considered an X corporation under sections Y and Z of the Blablablah act?\") that simply require an expert to fill out.Secondly, if a US citizens owns more than 50% of a foreign company, by default, income from that company counts as personal income, but taxes paid by the company to another government don't count as personal taxes.  You can get around this, apparently, but it's even more complicated.So because of [REDACTED] lawyers and accountants that have come up with these schemes, I have to spend precious starting capital to a bunch of accountants to prove I'm not evading taxes, rather than actually doing something useful with that money (and that accountant doing something more useful with their time).\n \nreply",
      "The \"problem\" you describe is your US citizenship requires you to pay tax on earnings from outside the US - that's a condition of US citizenship.  If you don't want to pay those taxes, then renounce your US citizenship once you have, say, gained UK citizenship, if that works for you.A famous bloke once said (probably in Hebrew, written up in Aramaic or Greek and badly translated into middle, modern and somewhat strange English): \"Pay unto Caesar, that which is due to Caesar and pay unto God that which is due to God\" or words to that effect.  Substitute IRS for God  and you have a suitably cynical aside!If your firm over here is good enough and you are reasonably settled then why not go all in?  I'm not sure what the rules are on reconnecting with the US if you have formally renounced citizenship.  However, I'm sure a birth cert from Yeehaw, TX or wherever will go some way.  Even so, UK citizens are generally welcomed in the Land of the Free.  An ESTA (great scheme IMO) costs about \u00a320 for two years coverage - more than enough to visit the relos.I know from second hand experience that our bureaucracy is just as convoluted as any other and it will take roughly one to two years (that was about 10 years ago) to get citizenship and probably involves a test that I would fail!You might like to look into where your company is actually registered.  A Ltd is not you - it is a separate legal entity and the UK (etc) is quite a complicated setup within quite a complicated environment.  You might explore Jersey and the Isle of Man for places to headquarter.  Don't overlook Eire either (EU with UK to the north, with special arrangements)Anyway, the snag you have is solely US based and not UK (for a change).\n \nreply",

Ana Maria Santacreu and\u00a0\u00a0Samuel Moore  of the St. Louis Fed provide some background in \u201cUnpacking Discrepancies in American and Irish Royalty Reporting\u201d (August 08, 2024). For those who don\u2019t keep up to speed on the details of international tax evasion schemes, Santacreu and Moore describe the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich works like this:The Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich tax scheme, as illustrated in the third figure, involved a complex arrangement between a U.S. parent company (USP) and three foreign subsidiaries. The first Irish subsidiary (I1) was incorporated in Ireland but managed from Bermuda, allowing it to avoid both Irish and U.S."

      "Context for those not following running news, The Boston Marathon lowered qualifying times for most prospective runners for 2026 race [0]. Because the Boston Marathon has limited capacity, you can only run if you either:1) raise $5k+ for a charity (limited spots)2) run a full marathon below* a qualifying timeThe reason it's below* is because even if you run under a qualifying time, there may be enough people even faster than you that fill up the available spots.This results in some years where you needed to be many minutes faster than the posted qualifying time to guarantee a spot, and every few years, the BAA (group in charge of Boston Marathon) drops the qualifying times.Note, even though the qualifying times have been dropping, they have been even faster in the past (see the 1980s)[1]As someone that's done the Boston Marathon a few times, I am glad they are trying to find a good balance of reasonable qualifying times for the most participation without dramatically expanding the field. I'm also always surprised with how popular and well known this marathon is given the NYC marathon (and others) are harder to get into, only about 2 of the miles are actually in Boston [2], and the start/finish are so far away making participating a logistic headache.

If there's driving rain, it's in your face for 26 miles (see 2018's race).(As an aside, there's a few tricks for the Abbot Majors to get places [aside from just buying one of the expensive guaranteed tour company places or being an elite runner])\n \nreply",

      "Everything looks great. I have tried to generate an app that generates stupid faces. At first it produced an app that generates what looks like random images - coffee tables, nature, people, pens... I have tried fixing it by chatting. It suggested to add an AI routine to make sure I'll be getting stupid faces. It broke itself and started to produce error messages instead of images. I have asked it to fix itself. It has added error handling, better error messages, and stupid face generation success rate bar to the UI, but I have never been able to generate a stupid face. Great idea though, and hopefully some day it will work.\n \nreply",
      "thanks for trying it out! I guess everything is fine in your code and just needed to direct the prompt a bit in the actual code (there is a tab 'code editor'). it's a bit what we're trying to improve.

      "I'm a huge fan of LLM-based tools, and I use them pretty much daily, but stuff like this concerns me a bit. In any dev process there needs to be a review step somewhere. Someone who understands code well needs to be looking at what the app is doing and making sure it's protecting my data. Someone needs to make sure there isn't a bug that loses the work I put in to creating records with a CRUD operation. They need to be making sure my privacy is respected in a legally compliant way. They need to make sure things are reasonably secure. None of that is guaranteed when you have a dev team, but it is a possibility at least.Telling Joe Random \"describe you app in a prompt and press deploy!\" guarantees that isn't happening. This sort of service is great for non-dev people who want to launch something but it's a pretty big threat to my data.I'm under no illusion that these services are going to be huge, and no doubt someone will sell an app built with one to a service that puts data about me into it.

There's also the risk that other major producers could replicate this tactic, potentially leading to further escalation in the region or beyond.In the short term, it's a smart strategy for Israel, but they've likely opened Pandora's box in the process.\n \nreply",

You can't get any more targeted than that.Yes, such a pager might have ended up in the hands of a non-involved person, but given the facts known so far that's very unlikely, because there's a reason those people were carrying these devices on them: They were afraid of being tracked down by Mossad in the first place.\n \nreply",

It's just that I've gotten used to it.When I started my PhD program, a group of us were given a little talk by the department secretary.She told the story of how she went to audition for Jeopardy!, a trivia game show.  She saw a whole bunch of other people at the audition get really nervous and choke up; her take on it was that they were used to being the most knowledgable in the room -- they were used to sitting in front of the TV screen with their friends or family and knowing every fact, and when they were suddenly confronted with a situation where everyone was as knowledgable as they were, they were suddenly very intimidated.She, on the other hand, was completely relaxed -- she spent her days working with Nobel prize winners and loads of other people for whom she had no doubt were smarter than her.  Being confronted with loads of people smarter than her was a daily experience.She told this story to us to say, a lot of you will experience the same thing: You were used to being the smartest person in your High School, you were even used to being the smartest person in your classes at the prestigious university you attended.  Now you'll encounter a situation where everyone is like you: the best and most driven people in your classes.You'll feel stupid and inferior for a bit, and that's normal.  Don't let it bother you.  Eventually you'll notice while that most of these other people have areas where they're better than you, they have areas where you're better.
