      "This is all very interesting, but is complete fiction for most readers. 99% of job seekers aren\u2019t going to receive competing offers from multiple companies conveniently at the same time.\n \nreply",
      "This is addressed in the article:> Turns out, it doesn\u2019t matter that much where your first offer is from, or even how much they\u2019re offering you. Just having an offer in hand will get the engine running.> If you\u2019re already in the pipeline with other companies (which you should be if you\u2019re doing it right), you should proactively reach out and let them know that you\u2019ve just received an offer. Try to build a sense of urgency. Regardless of whether you know the expiration date, all offers expire at some point, so take advantage of that.Anecdotally, I have seen this work many times to great effect.\n \nreply",
      "Me too. It was utterly bizarre. Spent 6 month looking for a job, with I don\u2019t know how many failed interviews, then I got one offer for a 6 month contract, and suddenly the next two companies I interviewed with were falling over themselves to give me a permanent one.I just do not see how that works. There\u2019s no logical reason for it.\n \nreply",
      "It is at least in part because of how recruiting works, especially in large tech companies. Companies have many candidates for each role, and can't easily review all of them. Between bureaucracy, how busy the hiring manager is, etc. many candidates get lost in the process.This is why 1) it really helps to have a referral and 2) tell the recruiter when you have competing roles. Neither will change much about getting or not a role, but they will really help the prioritization and avoid you getting lost.Paradoxically, that effect is bigger nowadays when the market is not as hot as it used to be, because recruiting is more stretched. Even some FAANG are very understaffed on the recruiting side\n \nreply",
      "In addition to your (presumably positive-enough) interview performance that the later company has themselves, they also have a \"hire\" recommendation from an entire other interview loop at a different company.That's a strong signal, and probably puts you ahead of most people interviewing at the later company, who only have the one set of positive feedback.\n \nreply",
      "This is the same logic as dealing with VC investors. Nobody feels confident  saying yes so they drag the process out. Then someone else does say Yes and they assume this other unknown party has figured out something they haven\u2019t. Now they have a sense of urgency over losing out on something. Even if they don\u2019t know what quality the entity offering the first Yes even saw.\n \nreply",
      "Perhaps having the 6mo contract in hand increased your confidence and changed the way you were carrying yourself and interviewing (subtly to you, but meaningfully).\n \nreply",
      "As a hiring manager, this might help negotiate pay up if I already wanted to hire you, but if I was on the fence, knowing someone I'm not thrilled with has an offer does basically nothing for me.\n \nreply",
      "And even if you receive two or more offers at once, many organizations don't bother negotiating.  One time I received two offers at once, and neither organization was willing to change anything substantive about their offers.In this case, one organization had an onerous IP policy and that other did not.  I asked for some carve-outs, and the first organization came back with a single line added to the IP policy that did not change anything meaningful.  I told them that I could not accept that offer as written and wanted more changes, but they refused further negotiation and told me to take it or leave it.  I waited a few days, rejected their offer, and accepted the other offer.(I think that they were willing to add the single meaningless line to make it appear they were willing to change things without actually changing anything substantive.)The morale of my story is that you may not be able to negotiate a better offer, but at least you have a choice when you have multiple offers.\n \nreply",
      "A priori, this is a very strange assertion.Assume that X% of companies are interested in you and you pursue Y leads to result in X% * Y offers. A large number of people will receive 0 offers and they'll be long term on the job market until they make a change to either X (job hunting strategy) or Y (pool of roles considered).A large number of people will receive >1 offers because they're competitive in the marketplace. Only some tiny number of people will receive exactly one offer unless Y is very small.That many people only receive one offer is more of a sign that they're not strategic in their job hunting approach (which is upstream of them not being strategic in their negotiations) and this is a fixable problem.\n \nreply"

      "This was an idea that sounded somewhat silly until it was shown it worked. The idea is that you encourage through training a bunch of \u201cexperts\u201d to diversify and \u201cget good\u201d at different things. These experts are say 1/10 to 1/100 of your model size if it were a dense model. So you pack them all up into one model, and you add a layer or a few layers that have the job of picking which small expert model is best for your given token input, route it to that small expert, and voila \u2014 you\u2019ve turned a full run through the dense parameters into a quick run through a router and then a 1/10 as long run through a little model. How do you get a \u201cpicker\u201d that\u2019s good? Well, it\u2019s differentiable, and all we have in ML is a hammer \u2014 so, just do gradient descent on the decider while training the experts!This generally works well, although there are lots and lots of caveats. But it is (mostly) a free lunch, or at least a discounted lunch. I haven\u2019t seen a ton of analysis on what different experts end up doing, but I believe it\u2019s widely agreed that they tend to specialize. Those specializations (especially if you have a small number of experts) may be pretty esoteric / dense in their own right.Anthropic\u2019s interpretability team would be the ones to give a really high quality look, but I don\u2019t think any of Anthropic\u2019s current models are MoE.Anecdotally, I feel MoE models sometimes exhibit slightly less \u201cdeep\u201d thinking, but I might just be biased towards more weights. And they are undeniably faster and better per second of clock time, GPU time, memory or bandwidth usage \u2014 on all of these - than dense models with similar training regimes.\n \nreply",
      "The only thing about this which may be unintuitive from the name is an \"Expert\" is not something like a sub-llm that's good at math and gets called when you ask a math question. Models like this have layers of networks they run tokens through and each layer is composed of 256 sub-networks, any of which can be selected (or multiple selected and merged in some way) for each layer independently.So the net result is the same: sets of parameters in the model are specialized and selected for certain inputs. It's just a done a bit deeper in the model than one may assume.\n \nreply",
      "the most unintuitive part is that from my understanding, individual tokens are routed to different experts. this is hard to comprehend with \"experts\" as that means two you can have different experts for two sequential tokens right?I think where MoE is misleading is that the experts aren't what we would call \"experts\" in the normal world but rather they are experts for a specific token. that concept feels difficult to grasp.\n \nreply",
      "It's not even per token. The routing happens once per layer, with the same token bouncing between layers.It's more of a performance optimization than anything else, improving memory liquidity. Except it's not an optimization for running the model locally (where you only run a single query at a time, and it would be nice to keep the weights on the disk until they are relevant).It's a performance optimization for large deployments with thousands of GPUs answering tens of thousands of queries per second. They put thousands of queries into a single batch and run them in parallel. After each layer, the queries are re-routed to the GPU holding the correct subset of weights. Individual queries will bounce across dozens of GPUs per token, distributing load.Even though the name \"expert\" implies they should experts in a given topic, it's really not true. During training, they optimize for making the load distribute evenly, nothing else.\n \nreply",

Instructions are the first thing you see and cover the puzzle. You then click start.Importantly, the instructions have an example. While the puzzle is extremely intuitive, an example can eliminate almost any ambiguity (intuitive for most people but maybe not kids, non-native English speakers, or just things like someone shoves the game into their friends face. Who knows). There can be a button on the side to show instructions again, which should cover the puzzle and stop the timer.  > Having a timer (urgency) is usually not a very good idea for thinky games.\n\nPersonally, I like the timer. The game is simple and clearly meant to be played in a small fast setting, so I think this works. Can also reduce pressure (as well as induce) since someone might think \"oh, I got 5 minutes to play\" instead of having to \"sit down\".There's plenty of \"thinky games\" that have timers: Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune are two good examples. Almost any TV game is timed.

      "I can\u2019t stop thinking about this article. I spent a long time in ad tech before switching to broader systems engineering. The author captures something I've struggled to articulate to friends and family about why I left the industry.The part that really struck me was framing advertising and propaganda as essentially the same mechanism - just with different masters. Having built targeting systems myself, this rings painfully true. The mechanical difference between getting someone to buy sneakers versus vote for a candidate is surprisingly small.What's frustrating is how the tech community keeps treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. We debate content moderation policies and algorithmic transparency, but rarely question the underlying attention marketplace that makes manipulation profitable in the first place.The uncomfortable truth: most of us in tech understand that today's advertising systems are fundamentally parasitic. We've built something that converts human attention into money with increasingly terrifying efficiency, but we're all trapped in a prisoner's dilemma where nobody can unilaterally disarm.Try this thought experiment from the article - imagine a world without advertising. Products would still exist. Commerce would still happen. Information would still flow. We'd just be freed from the increasingly sophisticated machinery designed to override our decision-making.Is this proposal radical? Absolutely. But sometimes the Overton window needs a sledgehammer.P.S. If you are curious about the relationship between Sigmund Freud, propaganda, and the origins of the ad industry, check out the documentary \u201cCentury of the Self\u201d.\n \nreply",
      "> imagine a world without advertisingI can't because a world with magic and world peace is more realistic and believable.It's impossible.  How do you even define advertising?  If you define it conservatively, then advertising will skirt through the loopholes.  If you define it liberally, then you have an unfair, authoritarian system that will definitely be selectively enforced against political enemies.And in all cases, you are self-imposing a restriction that will give other nations an economic advantage and jeopardizing long-term sovereignty.\n \nreply",
      "What you can do relatively easily is to control the physical format of advertising. For example, consider how rare \"billboards\" are outside of the USA. Or towns in various places that prohibit signage that is not in the same plane as the edge of the building (i.e. no sticky-outy signs).Or for that matter, consider Berlin, which has banned all non-cultural advertising on public transportation. Yes, there's some edge cases that are tricky, but overall the situation doesn't seem too fraught.\n \nreply",
      "You start conservatively, and set up a watchdog to investigate loopholes and punish those abusing them. Fund an astroturfing campaign? Congrats, that's 10 years and a hefty fine to fund the continued operation of the watchdog. You can make promotional material and publish it, but it has to be clearly labeled and opt-in, not bundled with access to something else. The problem isn't small-time promotion that's difficult or impossible to crack down on, it's that we've built a whole attention economy. So long as we make it a bad value proposition for big players we'll have succeeded.\n \nreply",
      "That is requiring advertisers to set the HTTP evil bit. If advertising is fine, they're happy to make it obvious that something is an ad.

Milan is not \"Europe\" either!I have driven/travelled across a lot, nearly all, European countries and the other one - the UK.You do not get those huge screens on stilts anywhere that I have seen in Europe, that seem to be common across the US.To be fair, I've only driven across about 10 US states.

One of my colleagues noticed that if they have recent builds of our product running in the background, this auto-locking does not take effect. I was asked to investigate.The bug itself got pretty low priority, as at first glance the phenomenon does not seem to cause that much trouble. I did not know anything about how all this works on Windows, but I had a hunch that if the lock screen is being prevented, chances are that the computer going to sleep gets the same treatment. This is a much bigger issue, as it might have a huge impact on the battery life of notebooks.The repro was pretty straightforward (launch the program, then wait X minutes, and note how the lock screen did not appear), and I also"

      "You pretty much need to use markup (or control codes) for rich text. Take bold, italic, underline, strikeout: those four can, and are, used in nearly any combination. You would need one bit for each of them. You would need two bits to specify four levels of headings. If you don't allow for that, you are back to using markup. You would also need one bit to specify proportional/fixed width font, because that is a thing too. That remaining bit would have to be used for superscript, since superscripts are commonly used for footnotes and simple mathematical expressions.Okay, you can now create passable rich text documents for a limited (though common) range of purposes with that 8/24-bit breakdown that was suggested. But you may have noticed the author mentioned subscripts, which wasn't in my list. Well, it turns out that subscript and superscript have a terribly limited range of applications if you are specifying them per character: x^2^2 would be visually identical to x^22, and x^a_b would look different from x_b^a (with both presentations being nonsensical). The use of subscripts and superscripts in any technical applications would be severely limited. You need a much richer markup language to be truly expressive. So there really isn't much of a point in offering subscripts. Superscripts, sure, because they have a few non-technical uses.Yet the reality is that people want a much richer set of formatting options. At a minimum, they want to select fonts and font sizes. Some of the formatting options have semantics. I know I crammed four levels of headings in those eight bits, but that only makes sense in headings. It doesn't make sense to specify it per character. Then there are other common document elements, like tables. You can create decent tables using monospaced fonts, but that is limiting and would produce undesirable results in some cases (try displaying April 5^th sensibly, using a monospace font so that it won't affect the width of the columns). On top of that, you are ditching the concept of styles because that implies some sort of markup.\n \nreply",

      "Nelson's arguments sound odd to me. He says that embedded markup is bad for WYSIWYG editors since they have to maintain a connection between the raw and formatted text streams (which can have different character counts, etc.), but out-of-line styling would similarly need careful implementation work to keep it synchronized with the text stream at all times, even with concurrent editing and other such features.(Cf. how the cross-reference stream in PDF files makes it painful to edit objects in them, even when the files are nominally encoded in plaintext.)He then goes into how a separate styling layer can assist with transcluding text from other people's work while modifying the style. But style variations are hardly the only legitimate changes typically made to direct quotations: people often want to modify capitalization or punctuation, elide portions, or insert bracketed notes. And at that point, you're modifying the content as well as the styling, so style-only modifications would be very limiting for that use case.As for the structure layer, this would have the same issues as every other attempt in the last three decades to create a semantic web or whatever.
