      "Just want to say how much I thank YCom for not f'ing up the HN interface, and keeping it fast.I distinctly remember when Slashdot committed suicide. They had an interface that was very easy for me to scan and find high value comments, and in the name of \"modern UI\" or some other nonsense needed to keep a few designers employed, completely revamped it so that it had a ton of whitespace and made it basically impossible for me to skim the comments.I think I tried it for about 3 days before I gave up, and I was a daily Slashdot reader before then.reply",

      "The one and only thing I'd do is make the font bigger and increase padding. There's overwhelming consensus that you should have (for English) about 50\u201370 characters per line of text for the best, fastest, most accurate readability. That's why newspapers pair a small font with multiple columns: to limit number of characters per line of text.HN might have over 100 chars per line of text. It could be better.

      "A narrow column of text can make it easier to read individual sentences, but it does so by sacrificing vertical space, which makes it harder to skim a page for relevant content and makes it easier for me to lose track of my place since I can't see as much context, images, and headings on screen all at once. I also find it much harder to read text when the paragraphs form monotonous blocks spanning 10 lines of text rather than being irregularly shaped and covering 3-5 lines. I find Wikipedia articles much harder to read in \"standard\" mode compared to \"wide\" mode for this reason.Different people process visual information differently, and people reading articles have different goals, different eyesight, and different hardware setups. And we already have a way for users to tell a website how wide they want its content to be: resizing their browser window. I set the width of my browser window based on how wide I want pages to be; and web designers who ignore this preference and impose unreadable narrow columns because they read about the \"optimal\" column width in some study or another infuriate me to no end. Optimal is not the same for everyone, and pretending otherwise is the antithesis of accessibility.reply",

Will check this one out for sure.One missing feature that the ChatGPT desktop app has and I think is a good idea for these local LLM apps is a shortcut to open a new chat anytime (Alt + Space), with a reduced UI.

      "One problem I have with learning Lean is that tactics - like rfl in the example - are overloaded, and their full semantics not completely explained/understandable from the tutorials. Unlike, say, C programming where one may understand what happens to the program state down to the bit, it feels too fuzzy. And the rewrite (rw) tactic syntax doesn't feel natural either.reply",
      "Yeah, I've similarly found the tactics in Coq (now Rocq) difficult to internalize. E.g., I might have \"A = B\" and \"P(A,A)\" available, and I want to conclude \"P(A,B)\", but the rewrite will fail for some arcane reason. (Issues with the definition of some of the intermediate structures, I'd imagine.)On the other end of the spectrum, I've recently been playing with Metamath and its set.mm database, which has no programmable tactics at all, only concrete inferences that can be used in a proof. (E.g., the modus ponens inference ax-mp says that \"|- ph\" and \"|- ( ph -> ps )\" prove \"|- ps\", where \"ph\" and \"ps\" are variables that can be substituted.) Alas, it's not much better, since now you have to memorize all the utility lemmas you might need!reply",
      "Agreed - the Metamath base language (and its verifier) seem to be the most tractable of all I've seen, although it is probably still quite far away from the complexity of the high level language(s) that compile to it.Derived from it, the currently best attempt to achieve an unambiguous and secure language seems to be Metamath Zero: https://github.com/digama0/mm0reply",
      "This is one of the reasons I prefer Agda. It is usually written without tactics, you just write the proof term in a functional programming language via the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence. The trade off is that you must be more disciplined with creating useful abstractions and functions, otherwise proving even routine stuff becomes really tedious.reply",
      "This is why I prefer Agda, where everything comes down to pattern matching.reply",
      "At least you can 'go to definition' on the tactics and see what they're doing. It's a lot to take in at the beginning, but it can all be inspected and understood. (At least until you get to the fundamental type theory; the reduction rules are a lot harder to get into.)> the rewrite (rw) tactic syntax doesn't feel natural either.Do you have any thoughts on what a natural rewrite syntax would be?reply",
      "> Do you have any thoughts on what a natural rewrite syntax would be?Not yet, but I'd probably prefer something that more explicitly indicated (in English, or some sort of more visually \"pointing\" indicator) which specific parts of the previous step would be replacedIt feels weird, or I'd have to get used to that both what is being replaced and what it is replaced with depends on some distant context, it's very indirect as it requires switching attention between the tactics tree and the context or previous proofsreply",
      "You may like Agda. I prefer Lean even though you are right about this.reply",
      "Yeah the documentation is also quite fragmented because tactics are user-definable and some are from Lean vs from Mathlib etc. I've gotten quite decent at using the basic ones but I still sometimes ask on Zulip if something isn't working as I expected.reply",
      "I\u2019ve been kicking around the idea of something like Lean (maybe even just Lean?) to rewrite news and other non-fiction articles, treating statements as theorems that need to be proven. Proofs could include citations, and could be compound things like \u201cthis is a fact if three of my approved sources asserted it as a fact\u201dIt should then be possible to get a marked-up version of any document with highlighting for \u201cproven\u201d claims.Sure, it\u2019s not perfect, but I think it would be an interesting way to apply the rigor that used to be the job of publications.reply"

      "A story about a non-technical friend: friend vibe coded a SaaS last year and started generating revenue with almost no marketing; all word of mouth and inbound in a niche industry. Used Replit and Supabase to build the thing; I am still really impressed by what he was able to do given how complex the app ended up becoming as he interacted with customers.What I think happened: there are two incumbents in this space that are not happy about him showing up and charging a fraction of their monthly cost for a better, more modern product (their products are Windows-based desktop software).  So they hired hackers to hack his SaaS (because these hackers have never demanded money).  Unfortunately, that vibe-coding resulted in some bad code that made it easy to hack.  First, the user list was leaked on the FE of the code and the hacker emailed all of the customers. Second, the hacker got a hold of his Stripe key and issued every customer a refund. Third, the hacker has been trying to inject XSS attacks into app (we'll see a random `<script>alert()</script>` tag in some fields)I think indeed, vibe-coded software in the hands of the inexperienced is instant tech debt.  But at the same time, he was able to prove out a viable business in a matter of a few months with no engineering background and no technical capability.Now he's hiring a developer to shore it up.Was it worth it?  Yes, it is terrible, shoddy, insecure code, but he proved out a viable business with just a few hundred dollars of investment.reply",
      "I would not default to assuming it was his competitors, that sounds like scapegoating to deflect responsibility. What most likely happened is his site was scanned by one of the increasingly sophisticated exploit crawlers (anyone who runs an internet facing site and can view traffic knows what I'm talking about). His site got flagged as vulnerable, the hacker found out it was built like swiss cheese and had fun with it.reply",
      "Who else would spend the time and effort to figure out you leaked your stipe key to your front end? Sure people have bots to do that, but it\u2019s kinda unbelievable someone would run such a bot on their vibe coded website.reply",
      "Why is it unbelievable? There is an entire industry of people trying to find vulnerable niche applications like this. There are bots which crawl the web, not to make an index, but just to find vulnerabilities. Nobody necessarily even had to 'point' anything at this at all, it just shows up on their dashboard one day and they get to dig in.reply",
      "I would not be surprised if Shodan.io ends up with queries for easily identifiable markers of vibe-coded software.reply",
      "I was being facetious. Yes, there are millions of bots that are constantly searching every website for leaked keys, passwords, database credentials, crypto wallets, firebase endpoints, s3 buckets, email addresses, phone numbers, etc. the list is bottomlessreply",

It takes a lot of time to understand unfamiliar code enough to debug it, let alone introduce new features without also introducing bugs.Programming is fundamentally theory building, not producing lines of code. We know this. This is why we make fun of business people who try to measure developer productivity in lines of code.When you vibe code, you are incurring tech debt as fast as the LLM can spit it out.

      "Small trains and small stations are good until they aren't, and then you're screwed.Singapore built the orbital Circle MRT line exactly as the author wants: small trains (3 carriages, vs 6-8 on other line), small stations to fit these trains, frequent fully automated operation.However, the line turned out to be much more popular than planners anticipated, with the result that at rush hour, it's common to have to queue just to enter the platform where you need to wait for multiple trains to arrive before you can squeeze in.And the tricky bit is that there is essentially nothing you can do now to fix it. There's a hard physical limit (around 90 secs) on how fast the cycle of a train arriving, people getting on and off, and departing can get, and retrofitting all 30+ deep underground stations to be larger would be an insanely expensive and disruptive exercise.reply",
      ">  essentially nothing you can do now to fix itYou can build another line.  This one was cheap and the demand is clearly there.  And two medium capacity lines are generally better than one high capacity line in terms of offering more options to travelers.reply",
      "Singapore started building MRTs in 1982 and essentially never stopped. However \"just build another line\" is a bit glib when you're dealing with a city state of 6 million people on an island roughly 40km x 20km. There is a huge opportunity cost if land is misused or underused.reply",
      "Well, at least we are putting our trains either on Pylons or underground.  But you are right about opportunity costs nevertheless.Also to add: building a high capacity line (say with 2x the capacity of the Circle Line) doesn't take 2x the land.  There are obvious economies of scale.Building two lower capacity lines has some diseconomies of scale, as the opportunity costs of the land use mount.reply",
      "It is much more expensive to build another line at that point due to the increase in density of the city (and sometimes new requirements of stations to meet building codes). Nearly every high volume transit system out there has choke points that are extremely expensive or impossible to fix by building another line. The tunnel between VA and DC on WMATA\u2019s Orange, Silver, and Blue lines is a 20 year project. Tracks for LIRR to go to Grand Central took 60 years from proposal to opening. It is viewed as nearly impossible to build a line parallel to the MBTA underground green line, a system that has short two car trains and 4 branches above ground on the Boston side, so very easily could use a parallel line.reply",
      "That's true, but if you've kept a lid on construction costs as light metros tend to do, the public will embrace building new relief lines that bring more service to areas with moderate access. That adds big capacity you can then continue to grow into. Paris is a great example of this, they often just add whole new lines rather than trying to wring a bit more capacity from existing ones.reply",
      "This makes a lot of sense to bring life to new districts naturally.reply",
      "Look into Streetcar Suburbs for a American examples.  You could do worse than starting with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetcar_suburbreply",
      "A similar thing happened with SkyTrain's Canada Line, where it reached capacity very soon after it was built. They did plan a contingency to be able to extend the platforms for somewhat longer trains, however.reply",
      "Canada Line is a bit weird since it wasn't built by Translink and doesn't use the same technology as the rest of SkyTrain. It was under built by the P3 out of caution for opening in time for the Olympics and extreme cost control, but they were really pessimistic in ridership projections. It was always going to burst at the seams pretty quickly, especially with all the transit oriented development along the route. It should have been built to the same ~80m platform as the rest of SkyTrain.My ideal default rapid transit buildout for midsized urban areas would basically be SkyTrain with value engineering to extend the platforms to 100 or 120m with minimal cost in the future.reply"

      "I am not an expert but still I am building enough agents. But I don't understand how this tool can be integrated with an exisiting system. Is it like an APM for agents if I understand it correctly ?reply",
      "the way it is integrated (its explained more in the docs) is by installing the python/typescript sdk and writing \"lai.init()\" at the top of your code. Then we capture all LLM calls and tools with integrated providers (similar to LLM ops platforms). If you want to manually add more information you can add decorators, lai.create_step/create_event \"logs\", etc.We then take all this information you give us and try to transform it i.e group together similar nodes, run an agent to evaluate a session, or to find root cause of a session failure in the backend.reply",
      "I'm looking into a tool like this for my startup. Why should I use this over Langfuse or Helicone?reply",
      "Langfuse and Helicone work well for traditional LLM operations, but AI agents are different. We discovered that AI agents require fundamentally different tooling, here are some examples.First, while LLMs simply respond to prompts, agents often get stuck in behavioral loops where they repeat the same actions; to address this, we built a graph visualization that automatically detects when an agent reaches the same state multiple times and groups these occurrences together, making loops immediately visible.Second, our evaluations are much more tailored for AI Agents. LLM ops evaluations usually occur at a per prompt level (i.e hallucination, qa-correctness) which makes sense for those use cases, but agent evaluations are usually per session or run. What this means is that usually a single prompt in isolation didn\u2019t cause an issue but some downstream memory issue or previous action caused this current tool to fail. So, we spent a lot of time creating a way for you to create a rubric. Then, to evaluate the rubric (so that there isn\u2019t context overload) we created an agentic pipeline which has tools like viewing rubric examples, ability to zoom \u201cin and out\u201d of a session (to prevent context overload), referencing previous examples, etc.Third, time traveling and clustering of similar responses.  LLM debugging is straightforward because prompts are stateless and are independent from one another, but agents maintain complex state through tools, context, and memory management; we solved this by creating \u201ctime travel\u201d functionality that captures the complete agent state at any point, allowing developers to modify variables like context or tool availability and replay from that exact moment and then simulate that 20-30 times and group together similar responses (with our clustering alg).Fourth, agents exhibit far more non-deterministic behavior than LLMs because a single tool call can completely change their trajectory; to handle this complexity, we developed workflow trajectory clustering that groups similar execution paths together, helping developers identify patterns and edge cases that would be impossible to spot in traditional LLM systems.reply"

      "\"The vulnerability we discovered was remarkably simple to exploit - by providing only a non-secret app_id value to undocumented registration and email verification endpoints.\" So you could sign yourself up as editor / collaborator on any app once you knew the app's ID.Jeez, that's sloppy. My colleague in 2000 discovered you could browse any account on his bank's website by just changing the (sequential!) account IDs in the URL.

      "I don't really understand why Youtube won't let me create a profile, on my paid family account that I'm paying $29 NZD a month for, which lets me whitelist channels.I'm happy for my kids to have free access to certain channels on youtube, but the mind numbing shorts, and shit they find on random channels just does my head in. And it seems to be getting worse, I'm not sure if its that they are getting older and able to search for more content or if the content is just getting worse, maybe both, but I'm probably just going to cancel the sub so they at least have to put up with terrible ads if they try to access it.reply",
      "> I don't really understand why Youtube won't let me create a profile, on my paid family account that I'm paying $29 NZD a month for, which lets me whitelist channelsThe answer is to this question is always: it is too niche a product feature for a giant corporation to prioritize. This product would require constant work to keep in sync as UIs and features change. It would be one more feature to regression test against an ever growing list changes, and an ever growing list of client apps that need to work across an endless list of phones, computers, tvs, etc.This is why it is important that society normalize third party clients to public web services. We should be allowed to create and use whatever UI we want for the public endpoints that are exposed.PS: this particular feature exists though.https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6172308?hl=en&...reply",
      "That feature isn't what I think the parent comment is asking for. What you've linked to is specifically YouTube Kids, and it's groups of channels whitelisted by the YouTube team. What I think the parent comment is asking for, and I want too, is full availability of all YouTube channels, but the ability to block everything except whitelisted channels. I agree, it's too niche a product. But I often think that people whose response to complaints about kids' access to inappropriate content is \"you need to parent your kids\" is fine, but I need the tools to do that! A tool like this would be a godsend.reply",
      "Not only that, but YouTube kids whitelists a ton of content I never want my kids watching, while exempting a decent chunk of things I'd be tickled pink if my kids watched.I don't want em watching cocomelon, I want them watching Steve Mouldreply",
      "Why is everyone saying this doesn't exist? It's right there on the linked page! It's called \"Approved Content Only\" and I assure you that it exists, it's a real feature, it works just like you want, I use it myself, my kids watch Primitive Technology and Smarter Every Day and they can't watch videos I don't whitelist.It does have a few issues. It's not reliable in showing everything you allow, sometimes things are missing for no reason, other times it will prevent you from whitelisting a video because it contains product placement (why does Google get to decide that for me? I'm an adult and can choose what level of product placement is acceptable for my kids). But it is a true whitelist mode and won't show other videos, just as requested.reply",
      "Because it's YouTube kids. Not YouTubeYT kids uses a separate app, with a different UI. It's branded as YouTube Kids. And once your kid hits a certain age, they do not want to be on the kids version.Another approach... Is to mark their kids account as a kids account or something, and have that just be on the regular YouTube website and app.Or what every parent really wants.To whitelist content your kid can watch like in YT Kids. But also include blacklisting shorts.The more this looks like regular YouTube. The better your chances of your kid not just signing out of the app. Or using a web browser with a logged out account to circumvent it.You have to give some illusion in order to maintain the control.reply",
      "YouTube Documentation on this feature - https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6172308?hl=en&...The embedded walkthrough video on how to set it up is really quite good.reply",
      "Edit: I just noticed the list of supported countries (in my link below) includes Canada but excludes the French-speaking province of Quebec. It seems a bit spiteful to go so far as to ensure a service can be legally delivered in such a long list of countries and then exclude Quebec. Hm, I was about to use Puerto Rico as an example, but it\u2019s not in the list as well, but perhaps it\u2019s considered part of the United States here.Now back to the comment I\u2019d written at first:It does seem to be, in typical large corporation fashion, a bit too complicated to set up. For example, there are three ways to add parental supervision, including a mode where you can transition from YouTube Kids to the full YouTube experience while still preserving those controls until a child is 13: https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/10495678?sjid=...That said, all it would take is an open web browser and a not signed in YouTube account for kids to bypass these controls. But I suppose that\u2019s not actually the point - the point of channel filtering is to reduce the harm recommendation engines and spammy content might have. The gotcha is that recommendation engines are everywhere now, spammy content is pervasive, and even AI responses in Google are arguably now a source of noise to be filtered.I will say, however, it\u2019s great to have an ad-free family plan for YouTube. I wish you could add more accounts to it, but for now I\u2019m getting by with YouTube brand (sub-)accounts to create separate lists of subscriptions, histories and recommendations while still staying ad-free in apps.And tools adults might find useful, I expect kids and teens would find useful too - for example, browser extensions to customize your YouTube experience.As long as we have an open web for e.g. YouTube, we do have independent options, if geeky enough to pursue them. :)reply",
      "An unfiltered web browser has stuff a lot worse than YouTube. That's on you if you give your kids access to that.reply",
      "Unfiltered web browsers might be harder to come by these days than when I was growing up, but they still exist. I remember finding out by accident that certain restricted apps would pull up help pages, and from there I could click a link that would take me to an unrestricted web browser due to a bug in the code. I also remember computers where you could show up with pocket apps on a floppy or USB key and bring your own unrestricted web browser. On top of that, just because the web is restricted often doesn\u2019t mean YouTube is restricted. For example, schools need YouTube to show educational content, so it often is unrestricted even when the rest of the web is restricted e.g. by dns.reply"
