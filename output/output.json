      "Those who TL;DRd - it's for the factory, not the cars!Old EV batteries are great for energy storage. A worse weight-to-capacity ratio doesn't matter for batteries sitting on the ground. A battery that holds only 70% of its original capacity is considered worn-out for EVs (and even replaced under warranty), but grid storage isn't driving anywhere, so any capacity left is still useful.reply",
      "Battery banks are worse than degraded raid arrays in some important respects. The bad cells tend to try to bring the rest of the pack with them. It\u2019s one of the reasons people keep toying with partitioning cells and putting controllers onto individual cells or small groups of them.Parting out two or three dead battery packs to cull the best of the survivors can improve things quite a bit. And as you say, on a stationary pack you can afford to overdo telemetry, cooling, and safety circuitry because it doesn\u2019t have to move, let alone accelerate.I don\u2019t know what the half life is like for the reused cells though. Do the cells that lasted twice as long as their neighbors continue to outperform or do they revert to the mean over time?  I could see either being true. The days when you accidentally produce cells that are several stddev better than your target quality should make cells that last longer, unless they\u2019re sold to a leadfootted driver.reply",
      "A degraded battery bank does not mean a bank with outright \"bad\" cells. The cells will probably be way more off than they used to be, but there can still be plenty of effective capacity in the bank. Heck, if space isn't an issue, it's productive as long as it isn't self-discharging too fast.You can still have a working battery even with some \"bad\" (i.e., way out of spec) cells, depending on the BMS. All the thresholds are configurable, just that a regular EV setup would lean towards safety.reply",
      "plus if you aren't making your packs unrepairable on purpose with foamed construction (like Tesla). you can par out modules in the packs into new configurations somewhat easily for the amount of work needed.reply",
      "There's usually a pretty big gap in time between 'worn' at say 70-80% of original capacity, and a pack that has actual failed cells in it too.reply",
      ">The bad cells tend to try to bring the rest of the pack with them.This is true (and in some cases potentially dangerous) when you have a  several cells of varying voltages in parallel but it's fairly trivial (by EE standards at least) to overcome this with something similar to a charge pump.reply",
      "You are talking about cells going bad and they are talking about cells that have less capacity from being cycled, not the same thing at all.reply",
      "At the cell level they don\u2019t degrade linearly. First it\u2019s slow then it\u2019s fast and then it\u2019s abrupt collapse. You probably have noticed that yourself with old devices. Some do not hold charge even for a minute.With battery packs probably you can do some smart things to make the degradation curve look more linear, but again there is only so much you can do.reply",
      "There\u2019s quite a lot you can do when you can isolate and deactivate individual cells, big battery packs like this really do not fall off a cliff in the same way you\u2019re describing.reply",
      "How do you achieve this with cells in series? Do you kill an entire row and put it on \"maintenance voltage\"? I know how balance charging RC batteries work but they're smaller scale and \"single row\".Also in RC car world it's generally preferred to have one cell per voltage step, I've had way more dual-cell(per series) packs fail than single ones. Though my experience is only 6s/~22v but it's \"the same shit on a bigger scale\" as far as I can comprehend.reply"

You were expected to code and manage a couple of more junior engineers.It\u2019s part of an effort to have dedicated managers and dedicated engineers instead of hybrid roles.This is being sold as an efficiency win for the sake of the stock price but it\u2019s really just moved a few people around with the TLMs now 100% focused on programming.reply",
      "GOOG has made a systemic push to eliminate the role starting ~3 years ago. At that time my M was a staff level IC TLM with 4 reports who was forcibly converted to EM.In those last 3 years I've only seen TLMs used to assist an overloaded EM.The pattern I've seen is something like:    Principal EM\n    |- Staff EM (7 reports, project A)\n    |- Staff EM (8 reports, project B)\n    |- Staff IC (projects A, B, C)\n    |- Senior IC (projects A, B)\n    |- Senior IC (project C)\n    |- Mid level IC (project C)\n    |- Mid level IC (project C)\n\nMaybe project C was just reorged under the Principal EM or maybe it's a speculative side project. But those last three are clearly clustered, there's no good line manager fit and the principal EM feels disconnected from the 2 mid level ICs. Project C is a bit of an island and projects A and B are taking up most of the EM's time.So the Principal EM deputizes Senior IC on project C as a TLM until things have changed enough that there can be a dedicated EM. Eventually the TLM converts to EM, a new EM is brought in, or there's a reorg, etc.Of the two times I saw saw it happen locally, both converted back to ICs after a year or two and noted that the role felt like being 70% IC and 70% EM.Nowadays the TLM role doesn't exist so the principal would delegate most of the technical responsibilities of the M role, giving them nearly full control of project C, but would not give them a formal role. (I've been that senior IC for project C.)(Edit for formatting.)reply",

      "TLM roles are a trap, but not in that sense. There's no expectation that you do two jobs at once.It's just a way to ease unsuspecting engineers into management. If you don't suck at management, your team inevitably grows (or you're handed over other teams), and before long, you're managing full-time.Which means that there are three type of people who remain TLMs in the long haul: those who suck at management; those managing dead-end projects on dead-end teams; or those who desperately cling on to the engineering past and actively refuse to take on more people. From a corporate point of view, none of these situations are great, hence the recent pushback against TLM roles in the industry.reply",

      "This was my experience in a TLM role - you have to manage down to your ICs but you have little lateral or upward power. You're basically just conveying whatever your manager decides to do with your team, but with all the additional responsibilities of a staff engineer.reply",
      "In big FAANG-style workplaces, I don't think that middle managers without the TL- prefix have the kind of influence or leverage you're talking about here. It changes at VP level, but ultimately, most of the corporate management hierarchy is just spreadsheet misery.reply"

If it needs to do something which requires talking to a web API it will often just populate the app with fake data silently. Apps for phones are very dependent on web APIs and with people heavily locking this down these days (when's the last time you've used an API that doesn't ask you for an API token?) I feel like most of the apps are limited to being local-only. There are plenty of nice local-only apps on iPhone, don't get me wrong. I'm sure there is a timer app that is just right for everyone.

      "Yeah this is an area we want to make a lot better. What we're currently thinking is giving the model a way to more explicitly call out that it is adding a call to something that needs an API key, which would add something to the UI to allow you to just paste in your key.I think there's also work when need to do in the system prompt to guide the model away from all of the placeholder data (or at least so that when it adds it there's a better affordance to transform it to real data).reply",

      "Last year I ported a virtio-host network driver written in Rust, entirely changing its backend, interrupt mechanism and converting it from a library to a standalone process. This is a complex program that handles low-level memory mappings, VM interrupts, network sockets, multithreading, etc.What\u2019s remarkable is that (a) I have very little Rust experience overall (mostly a Python programmer), (b) very little virtio experience, and (c) essentially no experience working with any of the libraries involved. Yet, I pulled off the refactor inside of a week, because by the time the project actually compiled, it worked perfectly (with one minor Drop-related bug that was easily found and fixed).This was aided by libraries that went out of their way to make sure you couldn\u2019t hold them wrong, and it shows.reply",
      "I've been writing Rust code for a while and generally if it compiles, it works. There are occasional deadlocks and higher-level ordering issues from time-to-time, but modulo bugs, the compiler succeeding generally means it'll run a decent amount of your project.reply",
      "Code written below your line gets executed if you don't return early. More breaking news at 8.Seriously, why would you think that assigning a value would stop your script from executing? Maybe the Typescript example is missing some context, but it seems like such a weird case to present as a \"data race\".reply",
      "Assigning to `window.location.href` has a side effects. The side effect is that your browser will navigate to wherever you assigned, as if you had clicked a link. This is already a surprising behaviour, but given that this assignment is effectively loading a new page in-place, kind of like how `execve` does for a process, I can totally see how someone would think that JS execution would stop immediately after a link is clicked.It's obviously not a good idea to rely on such assumptions when programming, and when you find yourself having such a hunch, you should generally stop and verify what the specification actually says. But in this case, the behaviour is weird, and all bets are off. I am not at all surprised that someone would fall for this.reply",
      "Part of the problem is that we unknowingly make a million little assumptions every day in the course of software development. Many of them are reasonable, some of them are technically unreasonable but fine in practice, and some of them are disasters waiting to happen. And it's genuinely hard to not only know which are which, but to notice even a fraction of them in the first place.I'm sure I knew the href thing at one point. It's probably even in the documentation. But the API itself leaves a giant hole for this kind of misunderstanding, and it's almost certainly a mistake that a huge number of people have made. The more pieces of documentation we need to keep in our heads in order to avoid daily mistakes, the exponentially more likely it is we're going to make them anyway.Good software engineering is, IMHO, about making things hard to hold the wrong way. Strong types, pure functions without side effects (when possible), immutable-by-default semantics, and other such practices can go a long way towards forming the basis of software that is hard to misuse.reply",
      "> when you find yourself having such a hunch, you should generally stop and verify what the specification actually saysIt greatly heartens me that we've made it to the point where someone writing Javascript for the browser is recommended to consult a spec instead of a matrix of browsers and browser versions.However, that said, why would a person embark on research instead of making a simple change to the code so that it relies on fewer assumptions, and so that it's readable and understandable by other programmers on their team who don't know the spec by heart?reply",
      "I use JavaScript for ~15 years. I thought it worked like that.reply",
      "I'm pretty sure it did used to work the other way.  Even if it didn't something changed recently so that the \"happen later\" behavior was significantly more likely to be encountered in common browsers.reply",
      "Whether you think that or not is not the issue - the fix is very obvious once pointed out to you.  The arguement the author is making is that a bug like that TS issue can be very difficult and time consuming to track down and is not picked up on by the compiler.reply",

      "> software quality doesn't appear because you have good developers. It's the end result of a process, and that process informs both your software development practices, but also your testing. Your management. Even your sales and servicing.If you only take one thing away from this article, it should be this one! The Therac-25 incident is a horrifying and important part of software history, it's really easy to think type-systems, unit-testing and defensive-coding can solve all software problems. They definitely can help a lot, but the real failure in the story of the Therac-25 from my understanding, is that it took far too long for incidents to be reported, investigated and fixed.There was a great Cautionary Tales podcast about the device recently[0], one thing mentioned was that, even aside from the catasrophic accidents, Therac-25 machines were routinely seen by users to show unexplained errors, but these issues never made it to the desk of someone who might fix it.[0] https://timharford.com/2025/07/cautionary-tales-captain-kirk...reply",
      "I'm going to disagree.I have years of experience at Boeing designing aircraft parts. The guiding principle is that no single failure should cause an accident.The way to accomplish this is not \"write quality software\", nor is it \"test the software thoroughly\". The idea is \"assume the software does the worst possible thing. Then make sure that there's an independent system that will prevent that worst case.\"For the Therac-25, that means a detector of the amount of radiation being generated, which will cut it off if it exceeds a safe value. I'd also add that the radiation generator be physically incapable of generating excessive radiation.reply",
      "In general I agree but there is bit more complexity. I work in medical devices and there are plenty of situations where a certain output is ok in some circumstance but deadly in another. That makes a stopgap a little more tricky.I agree with the previous poster that the feedback from the field is lacking a lot. A lot of doctors don\u2019t report problems back because they are used to bad interfaces. And then the feedback gets filtered through several layers of sales reps and product management. So a lot of info gets lost and fixes that could be simple won\u2019t get done.In general when you work in medical you are so overwhelmed by documentation and regulation that there isn\u2019t much time left to do proper engineering. The FDA mostly looks at documentation done right and less at product done right.reply",

      "Completely safe as long as the block of metal was in place. So you couldn\u2019t just prevent the machine from putting out that much energy, you had to prevent it from doing that without the block in place.reply",
      "This.One of the biggest things I see in junior engineers that I mentor (working in backend high throughput, low latency, distributed systems) is not working out all of the various failure modes your system will likely encounter.Network partitions, primary database outage, caching layer outage, increased latency ... all of these things can throw a spanner in the works, but until you've experienced them (or had a strong mentor guide you) it's all abstract and difficult to see when the happy path is right there.I've recently entirely re-architected a critical component, and part of this was defense in depth. Stuff is going to go wrong, so having a second or even third line of defense is important.reply",
      "I might also add that apparently, older versions of the machine had physical \u201chardware interlocks\u201d that would make accidents less likely no matter what the software was doing. So the older software was probably just thought to be reliable, but it had a physical mechanism that was helping it to not kill someone. On a less serious note that\u2019s part of why car doors might still have keyholes even if normally they open in a fancy way with electronic fobs.reply",
      "I think the range of radiation dose might vary too much to make a radiation source a totally isolated system, but trying to keep it as a simple physical lockout, I could imagine part of the start up process involving inserting a small module containing a fuse that breaks at a certain current that could be swapped out for different therapies or something. Could even add a simple spring+electromagnet mechanism that kicks that module out when power gets cut so radiotechs have to at least acknowledge the fuse before start up each time.I will say that me pretending to know how to best design medical equipment as a web developer is pretty full of myself haha. Highly doubt whatever I'm spouting is a new idea. The idea of working on this sort of high-reliability + high-recoverability systems seems really interesting though!reply",
      "I was going to recommend that exact podcast episode but you beat me to it. Totally worth listening, especially if you're interested in software bugs.Another interesting fact mentioned in the podcast is that the earlier (manually operated) version of the machine did have the same fault.

      "Speaking of Forth...  Here's a fun bit of trivia.PowerPC and Intel Macs used to use Open Firmware[0] to define their firmware (BIOS).  Macs with M1[1] architectures and subsequent generations may also, but I cannot attest to this.For those Macs which do use Open Firmware[0], a key implementation component of it is FCode[2]:  FCode is a Forth dialect compliant to ANS Forth, that is \n  available in two different forms: source and bytecode. \n  FCode bytecode is the compiled form of FCode source.\n\nSo if anyone asks, \"who uses Forth anymore?\", a correct answer is - a large percentage of everyday people.0 - https://www.openbios.org/Open_Firmware.html1 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M12 - https://www.openbios.org/Forth_FCode.htmlreply",
      "Nice to see another developer who tried to implement Forth in Go (here\u2019s mine: [0]). It\u2019s not easy and usually takes several iterations.His implementation, while working for his use cases, is actually quite far from the originals. He uses separate Go structures for words, memory, for-loops, etc. Most of the default Forth implementations of words will fail, since they expect the heap and stack to behave in a certain way. Also, every major word is implemented directly in Go, with no bootstrapping.> However, it's insufficient for the hacker level, because the host language interpreter (the one in Go) has all the control, so it's impossible to implement IF...THEN in ForthWell, I did it with a ... heap []any ... data structure. Works well enough.[0] https://github.com/s-macke/Forthlyreply",
      "Thanks for the note. Much of the blog post is dealing with this - how the approach I took for the Go implementation is not sufficient for the hacker level - because the code isn't stored anywhere but remains as text. This isn't a Go issue, it's a result of the specific design decision of how to implement it.The second implementation - in C - does it the \"right way\", with both code and data living in the same memory, and thus allows all the usual Forth shenanigans. Again, this has all to do with the design approach and not the implementation language. Nothing precludes one from writing such an implementation in Go :-)reply",
      "One of your \"Click to run\" examples is called \"faculty calculation\". I'm not a forth expert but it looks like a factorial function. Is \"faculty\" a replacement for \"factorial\" in some contexts?reply",
      "German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish use the same word for faculty (university) and factorial (mathematics), so I'm guessing it's a mistranslation from Fakult\u00e4t/faculteit/fakultet.reply",

      "I must say, implementing Forth in almost any high-level language, even C, can be awkward and almost antithetical. A \"high-level\" Forth implementation often merely presents a Forth-compatible runtime, which runs the risk of missing what makes Forth so unique and useful. (The author actually seems to understand this: \"The first implementation I tried is stubbornly different. Can we just make a pure interpreter?\")That's because of two main reasons. First, Forth relies heavily on passing control to the next word, instead of calling word implementations as subroutines. This is difficult to do correctly, and dynamically, in C. I suppose you could get by with computed gotos, but...Secondly, Forth and assembly (or more generally any lower-level instruction/register view of what it's running on) go hand in hand. Forth words may carry their own assembly implementation within them, or they may be partially assembly.Without those two things, you don't really have a Forth system, just a Forth interpreter. And you cannot define new primitive words, or words with very custom compilation semantics, from within Forth itself.And therein also lies Forth's strength. It is very easily on-the-fly expandable, and it can even bootstrap itself. It is a great tool for machine-level exploration: Do complex low-level things with a lot less boilerplate.The author mentions that this second attempt is a \"hacker level\" implementation, but short of reading the source code does not seem to go into any detail what that means exactly, and how it's implemented?reply",
      "I feel like as if the article itself is not finished at the end:> How can you know the arity of the functions without adding explicit comments? Sure, if you have a handful of words like bar and foo you know like the back of your hand, this is easy. But imagine reading a large, unfamiliar code base full of code like this and trying to comprehend it.Cool project by the way! Well done.reply",
      "Thanks for the feedback! What do you feel is not finished?reply",
      "I think (unless I missed it) it could be mentioned that typically you are supposed to have as small words as possible, with least amount of stack shuffling, and comment code as much as possible (stack effects). That said, I have not had to maintain large Forth projects so I have no clue how well I would fare ^^.BTW, have you heard of https://factorcode.org? You might like it!reply"
