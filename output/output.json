      "> Large object promisors are special Git remotes that only house large files.I like this approach. If I could configure my repos to use something like S3, I would switch away from using LFS. S3 seems like a really good synergy for large blobs in a VCS. The intelligent tiering feature can move data into colder tiers of storage as history naturally accumulates and old things are forgotten. I wouldn't mind a historical checkout taking half a day (i.e., restored from a robotic tape library) if I am pulling in stuff from a decade ago.reply",
      "At my current job I've started caching all of our LFS objects in a bucket, for cost reasons. Every time a PR is run, I get the list of objects via `git lfs ls-files`, sync them from gcp, run `git lfs checkout` to actually populate the repo from the object store, and then `git lfs pull` to pick up anything not cached. If there were uncached objects, I push them back up via `gcloud storage rsync`. Simple, doesn't require any configuration for developers (who only ever have to pull new objects), keeps the Github UI unconfused about the state of the repo.I'd initially at spinning up an LFS backends, but this solves the main pain point, for now. Github was charging us an arm and a leg for pulling LFS files for CI, because each checkout is fresh, the caching model is non-ideal (max 10GB cache, impossible to share between branches), so we end up pulling a bunch of data that is unfortunately in LFS, every commit, possibly multiple times. Because of this they happily charge us for all that bandwidth, because they don't provide tools to make it easy to reduce bandwidth (let me pay for more cache size, or warm workers with an entire cache disc, or better cache control, or...)....and if I want to enable this for developers it's relatively easy, just add a new git hook to do the same set of operations locally.reply",
      "Same and never understood why it wasn't the default from the get go but maybe it wasn't so synonymous when it first came out.I run a small git LFS server because of this and will be happy to switch away the second I can get git to natively support S3.reply",
      "TFA asserts that Git LFS is bad for several reasons including because proprietary with vendor lock-in which I don't think is fair to claim. GitHub provided an open client and server which negates that.LFS does break disconnected/offline/sneakernet operations which wasn't mentioned and is not awesome, but those are niche workflows. It sounds like that would also be broken with promisors.The `git partial clone` examples are cool!The description of Large Object Promisors makes it sound like they take the client-side complexity in LFS, move it server-side, and then increases the complexity? Instead of the client uploading to a git server and to a LFS server it uploads to a git server which in turn uploads to an object store, but the client will download directly from the object store? Obviously different tradeoffs there. I'm curious how often people will get bit by uploading to public git servers which upload to hidden promisor remotes.reply",
      "Another way that LFS is bad, as I recently discovered, is that the migration will pollute the `.gitattributes` of ancestor commits that do not contain the LFS objects.In other words, if you migrate a repo that has commits A->B->C, and C adds the large files, then commits A & B will gain a `.gitattributes` referring to the large files that do not exist in A & B.This is because the migration function will carry its ~gitattributes structure backwards as it walks the history, for caching purposes, and not cross-reference it against the current commit.reply",
      "LFS is bad. The server implementations suck. It conflates object contents with the storage method. It's opt-in, in a terrible way - if you do the obvious thing you get tiny text files instead of the files you actually want.I dunno if their solution is any better but it's fairly unarguable that LFS is bad.reply",
      "It does seem like this proposal has exactly the same issue.  Unless this new method blocks cloning when unable to access the promisors, you'll end up with similar problems of broken large files.reply",
      "How so? This proposal doesn\u2019t require you to run `git lfs install` to get the correct files\u2026reply",
      "Git LFS didn't work with SSH, you had to get an SSL cert which github knew was a barrier for people self hosting at home.  I think gitlab got it patched for SSH finally though.reply",

      "Intel SGX/remote attestation for verifying that servers are running the code they say they are running is very interesting, I believe Signal talked about doing something similar for contact discovery, but at a base level it requires a lot of trust. How do I verify that the attestation I receive back is the one of the machine I am contacting? Can I know for sure that this isn't a compromised SGX configuration, since the system has been broken in the past? Furthermore, can I really be sure that I can trust SGX attestations if I can't actually verify SGX itself? Even if the code running under SGX is verifiable, as an ordinary user it's basically impossible to tell if there are bugs that would make it possible to compromise.Personally I like the direction Mullvad went instead. I get that it means we really can't verify Mullvad's claims, but even in the event they're lying, at least we got some cool Coreboot ports out of it.If you're really paranoid, neither this service nor Mullvad offers that much assurance. I like the idea of verifiability, but I believe the type of people who want it are looking to satisfy deeper paranoia than can be answered with just trusting Intel... Still, more VPN options that try to take privacy claims seriously is nothing to complain about.reply",

      "Intel audits configuration on system launch and verifies it runs something they know safe. That involves CPU, CPU microcode, BIOS version and a few other things (SGX may not work if you don't have the right RAM for example).The final signature comes in the form of a x509 cerificate signed with ECDSA.What's more important to me is that SGX still has a lot of security researchers attempting (and currently failing) to break it further.reply",
      "> Any network protocol can be spoofed, with varying degrees of difficulty.Because of the cryptographic verifications, the communication cannot be spoofed.reply",
      "Intel will not attest insecure configurations. Our client will automatically verify the attestation it receives to make sure the certificate isn't expired and has a proper signature under Intel's CA trust.A lot of people have been attempting to attack SGX, and while there have been some successful attacks these have been addressed by Intel and resolved. Intel will not attest any insecure configuration as do other TEE vendors (AMD SEV, ARM Trustzone, etc).reply",
      "I really am interested in how this works. How can the client software verify that the SGX attestation actually is from the same machine as the VPN connection? I guess there's probably an answer here, but I don't know enough about SGX.reply",
      "The way this works is by generating a private key inside the enclave and having the CPU attest its public key.This allows generating a self signed TLS certificate that includes the attestation (under OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.105.1) and a client connecting verifying the TLS certificate not via the standard chain of trust, but by reading the attestion, verifying the attestation itself is valid (properly signed, matching measured values, etc) and verifying the containing TLS certificate is indeed signed with the attested key.Intel includes a number of details inside the attestation, the most important being intel's own signature of the attestation and chain of trust to their CA.reply",

There is a statue to Ficino when you walk into the library. Ficino was hired by Cosimo Medici (the Florentine who invented banking and funded much of the Florentine renaissance) to translate Plato and other esoteric books coming from the fall of Constantinople. He published \u201a\u00c4\u00faDe Mysteriis\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 in 1497, which paraphrases neoplatonic understanding of Gods, Demons, Heroes and Soul \u201a\u00c4\u00ee arguing that gods and demons don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t feel \u201a\u00c4\u00ee indeed, not even the soul (\u201a\u00c4\u00fathe lowest of the divines\u201a\u00c4\u00f9) has any part that feels.(Aside: This idea was actually referenced in \u201a\u00c4\u00faK Pop Demon Hunters,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 where they debate whether demons can feel \u201a\u00c4\u00ee or are \u201a\u00c4\u00faall feelings\u201a\u00c4\u00f9)It is an old Pythagorean tradition that sensation or consciousness arises out of the interaction of the immaterial soul and the material body.

      "Something I heard recently on some podcast which really resonated was (paraphrasing): \"Inertia is the biggest issue for a startup. The world doesn't like you, doesn't think it needs you... and you've got to invert that. You have to create momentum by scratch and the most important thing a founder does, by an order of magnitude, is invert inertia. Literally, in a physical sense. Like the world stays at rest and you've got to create momentum.\" With that in mind, it makes sense to do things that don't scale... because in the beginning, you're not trying to optimize a machine that's already running. You're trying to get the engine to turn over at all. PG's point is that scalable growth comes later; first, you have to manually crank the thing into motion. You do manual stuff not because it's efficient, but because it's the only way to get traction when no one's looking for you in the first place. And that's how you learn what actually works, how you build momentum one user at a time, and how you prove there's something worth scaling at all.reply",
      "I also think that the biggest value in doing things manually is that you actually learn.One of my clients used to make a nice curated list of the important financial and stock market news of the week, it was a niche part of a niche product but people loved it.At some point he thought about automating everything, it became less curated, more spammy, it lost any value and in the end so did the product. Sure there was more news, but it was less curated, edited and the signal to noise ratio got worse.In fact what they did manually was more valuable even if the scope was smaller.Many companies don't understand that and rush into premature optimization.I'll have another example: one of my clients wanted a scraper to automate something his company needed to do manually: check competitors prices on their ecommerces.I built it, way simpler than they wanted (they thought they wanted an app with a proper front end, turns out it was better for both to produce an excel spreadsheet with the data) and they were happy.Then after some time they understood that they were missing part of the experience: navigating their competitors manually allowed them to see new approaches to show the catalogue, new trends and products, they were actually learning from the competition.Eventually they realized and got back to doing it, and left my scraper just for price analysis.But the overwhelming majority of my clients keep putting automation before the product and problem and misses important learning opportunities.reply",
      "People focus on the primary function they want to automate and forget about all the ancillary functions and effects, which, in aggregate, can be as important as the core function.reply",
      "That's a really good point, doing things manually is an important part of being connected to a job and its outcomes. I will also say, sometimes you need a few hours of little manual tasks to break up the day between brain-heavy tasks.reply",
      "Of course there's survivor bias.But the point he makes is completely valid that you have to start by doing things yourself and not automating. I think the biggest value of that is you actually build a more granular mental model of how things work that simply can't be captured by slides and memos.You also build what the cool kids now call taste. It's what does good look like and why? And often it means having a strong perspective on decisions people would be either ambivalent to or not even recognize that a decision is needed.AI means many will skip and try to automate prematurely.At www.socratify.com We build our pedagogical content manually. Even though everyone tells us that we should use AI, we want to curate a set of context that's high quality because it's what our users interact withI'm sure we'll semi-automate on the validation side pretty quickly, but it's hard to replace raw human brainpower even with the smartest models and we learn a lot quickly.reply",
      "My theory is that there are three regimes: Not Scaling, Scaling, and Antiscaling.Not Scaling is about crossing and shoring up your moat. Scaling is when your app has enough hype around it that your customers recruit new customers, and all you have to do is add new machines or shard the database or whatever to handle increased demand.Antiscaling is when you turn into the thing that everyone hates about the modern web. Antiscaling is when intelligence agencies want to talk to you about how your chat app is used by terrorists, when cities want to licence access to your ridesharing or takeaway delivery app, when pieces of legislation are passed that are specifically designed to target your company, when you're sufficiently well-known as the founder of an app that people are making memes about you and tracking your personal movements.You don't have to take over the world, you just have to make money. People who try to change the world often change it for the worse; just try to make something useful, and maybe the world will like it.reply",

      "I have not seen profit used as a misplaced target in Goodhart\u2019s Law before.The typical example is something like headcount targets that lead to employing or laying off some of the wrong people.I think that profit is more of a force like gravity than a future target that distorts strategy.reply",
      "It may not be the usual example, but I believe it an apt one: shrinkflation and other kinds of forever \"cutting costs\" to the detriment of everything else is so normalised it's a cliche. We expect planned obsolescence now.reply",

Where using the TSC is practical and reliable, the optimization is already there.OpenBSD actually only implemented this optimization relatively recently. Though most TSCs will be invariant, they still need to be trained across cores, and there are other minutiae (sleeping states?) that made it a PITA to implement in a reliable way, and OpenBSD doesn't have as much manpower as Linux.

      "This does not account for frequency scaling on laptops, context switches, core migrations, time spent in syscalls (if you don\u2019t want to count it), etc. On Linux, you can get the kernel to expose the real (non-\u201creference\u201d) cycle counter for you to access with __rdpmc() (no syscall needed) and put the corrective offset in an memory-mapped page.

(The official AMD docs will admonish you not to assign meaning to anything but the fraction APERF / MPERF in one place, but the conjunction of what they tell you in other places implies that MPERF must be the reference cycle count and APERF must be the real cycle count.) This is definitely less of a hassle, but in my experience the cap_user_rdpmc method on Linux is much less noisy.[1] https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html[2] https://www.computerenhance.com/p/halloween-spooktacular-day...reply",

      "Oh hey good to see some more literature on TextKit2. I remember diving into it when I wrote my proof of concept markdown renderer:https://github.com/SuperSwiftMarkup/SuperSwiftMarkdownProtot...It\u2019s a good example of what else you can do with TextKit2, beyond plain text rendering. Here, I can draw text layout fragments in a core graphics context and use typographic information to also render markdown specific graphics in the background or foreground such as markdown tables. One day I\u2019d love to experiment with a markdown centric spread sheet app.At the time there was so little online info that I had to figure out everything on my own (and no chatbots didn\u2019t have a clue about TextKit2), but STTextView was a great reference. Overall his open source work was very much appreciated. (I should probably say as much in the read me.)That experiment was also a ton of work that ultimately didn\u2019t go anywhere. Most people would rather just use a relatively subpar embedded browser (i.e. web view).reply",
      "Oh also I\u2019d like to add to the above, the TextKit2 API is way more freeform than people think. You could probably implement your own web browser upon it with optimized line by line text rendering (which isn\u2019t that bad). One thing I always wanted to experiment with is rendering markdown content with horizontally scrollable text fragments for table rows and certain fenced code blocks. Super cool and practical idea for native markdown text rendering. Moreover, in some ways it seems pretty easy to do in TextKit2 since you get very fine grained control over text layout fragment rendering.reply",

He explores the edges of the API, so his writing helped me identify a nice bounds of safe-space to work in, and helped clarify what areas are too complex to safely build custom functionality within.

The OpenSIL is a\nnew initiative to unify the silicon initialization for AMD platform across\nmultiple firmware frameworks, like EDK2 and coreboot. Following the successful\nintegration of Genoa (Turin\u2019s predecessor) Proof of Concept in coreboot, we\nare striving for a brand new Turin processor family.The first phase of the project consisted of couple milestones:Milestone a.

      "The irony about getting treatment for ADHD is that medical providers make it very hard to get the proper medication and treatment. People with ADHD are horrible at following through and handle rejection poorly. So the worse the ADHD is, the less likely somebody will be able to actually get treatment for it. A lot of people suffer because doctors fear losing their license like so many did during the pain pill debacle. It's a risk for them to prescribe a stimulant, but zero risk to tell you to eff off.As many have said in this thread, most doctors will tell you to go away or give you Welbutrin (which works poorly, if at all). I feel for your struggle.reply",
      "I literally did the thing you\u2019re not supposed to do.my psych kept giving me everything by Adderall.  So I went to one of those online doctors and got Adderall through her.Then I just told my psychiatrist that I have Adderall prescription and she took it over.For the record, she\u2019s actually really reasonable and I like her but very conservative about the stimulants.  Which when I finally got them were a revelation.  Medication that actually works.reply",
      "I think of this stuff when folks say \u201ctrust the science!\u201d. It\u2019s all trust the science until that science conflicts with some broader agenda of a federal agency or a doctor\u2019s whims about risks to their license.Medicine really has a bad problem with groupthink. To get the best healthcare you have to both trust physicians and be critical of them.Then the DEA seems to consider stimulants as a moral failing.I\u2019ve been off Concerta for 3-4 years now because it was so difficult to keep my productivity up when the pharmacies near me ran out due to the unpublished extra-legal DEA caps on stimulants.Luckily even have been on Concerta has helped me learn how to manage my ADHD a bit better. It also gave me the chance to heal some of the worst traumas due to undiagnosed ADHD.reply",
      "No, it's all trust the science until we notice that the science is all coming from people who sell the drug, or people who are paid by people who sell the drug.The drug companies started creating patients groups in the 60s and 70s that they would use to lobby government with sick protestor-activists that scream that the government is trying to kill them by not approving (or paying for) some drug that the company who funds the patient's group 100% wants to sell.People in those patient groups (or informed by them) adopt bizarre conspiracy theories about increased drug controls or bans; theories that make no economic sense. Why in the world would anybody be motivated to suppress the widespread usage of adderall for ADHD (which has no physical diagnosis criteria, just a subjective checklist), other than they believe there's a problem with a lot of people taking it?Who would be bribing them? Do you think that the DEA gets to make decisions about drug policy, or that they all belong to some secret anti-adderall church?reply",
      "There's absolutely people who don't believe in any psychiatric medication, either for religious or just pseudo-scientific reasons. Look at how harshly the United States has treated marijuana users compared to smokers and alcoholics. There's moral and social judgement associated with different substances which is contingent on history and not based in fact.reply",
      "The DEA put Adderall on its list of the most abused medication, and limits production of it and investigates doctors who prescribe too much of it. This is a response to the problems with the abuse of legal opiates a decade ago- the DEA now takes potential abuse of legal drugs much more seriously and adderall (an amphetamine- it's a cousin of meth) is at a high risk of abuse.Your psychiatrist is trying to deal with the DEA monitoring, and doesn't want to be the one who first puts you on it, but continuing an existing Rx is not treated the same by the DEA, as I understand it. So the online doc is putting her license more at risk to a DEA investigation, but your in-person doctor is less exposed.N.B. this is how I understand the things that my wife has said to me. She is actually a pharmacist who has to deal with these things, and I might have garbled something.reply",
      "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this study were funded by some pharmaceutical lobbying shell organization.I was on various forms of prescribed amphetimines for years and developed paranoia. It took me a few years to somewhat recover. My family has PTSD about that period of my life. I can\u2019t think or communicate well anymore. Fuck that industry.reply",
      "You're right, and the situation is a harm to those who need adderall. Besides, adderall is not nearly as dangerous as Opiods. Whoopty-doo if it's diet Coke. This is why, even though I don't like Adderall's side effects for my ADHD and don't use it often, I keep the prescription, because fuck the government trying to squeeze pharmacists and doctors.reply",

      "LLMs are not people, but I can imagine how extensive interactions with AI personas might alter the expectations that humans have when communicating with other humans.Real people would not (and should not) allow themselves to be subjected to endless streams of abuse in a conversation.

      "Yeah, but my interpretation of what the user you\u2019re replying to is saying is that these LLMs are more and more going to be teaching people how it is acceptable to communicate with others.Even if the idea that LLMs are sentient may be ridiculous atm, the concept of not normalizing abusive forms of communication with others, be they artificial or not, could be valuable for society.It\u2019s funny because this is making me think of a freelance client I had recently who at a point of frustration between us began talking to me like I was an AI assistant. Just like you see frustrated people talk to their LLMs. I\u2019d never experienced anything like it, and I quickly ended the relationship, but I know that he was deep into using LLMs to vibe code every day and I genuinely believe that some of that began to transfer over to the way he felt he could communicate with people.Now an obvious retort here is to question whether killing NPCs in video games tends to make people feel like it\u2019s okay to kill people IRL.My response to that is that I think LLMs are far more insidious, and are tapping into people\u2019s psyches in a way no other tech has been able to dream of doing. See AI psychosis, people falling in love with their AI, the massive outcry over the loss of personality from gpt4o to gpt5\u2026 I think people really are struggling to keep in mind that LLMs are not a genuine type of \u201cperson\u201d.reply",

New forms of technology are capable of blurring the lines between fantasy and reality to a greater degree. This is true of LLM chat bots to some degree, and I worry it will also become a problem as we get better VR. People who witness or participate in violent events often come away traumatized; at a certain point simulated experiences are going to be so convincing that we will need to worry about the impact on the user.reply",

      "> Personally, though, I\u2019ll take the second game\u2019s refinement over any such nebulous quality. If I was coming to Dungeon Keeper cold today, this is definitely where I would start.This was my feeling, too, having no prior history with Dungeon Keeper and buying both titles on sale on GOG in the past year. DKII is definitely easier for the modern gamer to jump into. It also had some gameplay ideas that were novel and not terribly well-developed, but just fun--like being able to possess an individual grunt and suddenly have the isometric real-time strategy shift to a first-person perspective.reply",

      "Start with the vertical patterns; The vertical patterns happen for any composite number. Take the number 10 for example. Obviously numbers 10n + [0,2,4,6,8] are divisible by 2 and 10n + 5 are divisible by 5. So you can understand the vertical gaps in primality whenever you display a composite number. Multiple's of 10 is one you can probably grasp quickly but there's nothing special about base 10.Now when you take a vertical pattern like you see with column width=10 and add one more to the column size (so make it 11) the pattern is now offset by one pixel on each row. This makes the vertical pattern render diagonally as each row is offset by a pixel.So you get the patterns going between vertical and diagonal. This can get really interesting when you have a bunch of composite numbers in a row. Each composite number has it's own vertical pattern as described above. So 435 has gaps every 3rd and 5th number (and for other factors) since those will be multiple of 3 or 5. Now the next number, 436 rotates this pattern 45degrees since it offsets each row by 1 pixel. But.. 436 has it's own patterns, eg. every second number is a multiple of 2 when offset from 436 since 436 is even. So it has it's own vertical patterns but also shows the diagonals from gaps in 435.Anyway these well understood gaps in primality give a galaxy appearance for this simple reason. You're seeing well understood vertical patterns shifting to render diagonally with new vertical patterns from alignment on the next number and repeat.reply",

      "Ah, blockchains, where people realize all those \"it doesn't matter bugs\" with 3 layers of indirection due to shaky primitives, actually matter. Other bugs like this could be used to execute arbitrary code on the computer that compiles the software, calling random \"important looking\" stuff into memory (xz backdoor style) to be decoded and executed by the backdoor. Of course, there will never be a day where you can compile untrusted code in Solidity.> The lesson? Always test critical software under multiple compilers and library versions \u2014 especially when enabling a new language standard.Don't have giga-complicated language jockey stuff backing software that can't afford to even have one bug.reply",
      "This is why I quit using eth. They were just way too comfortable with insane complexity.reply",
      "All I took away from this is how more and more complicated C++ as a language becomes to make the syntax slightly more convenient.reply",
      "I get as exasperated at C++ as anyone else, but IMO there's another takeaway here, which is that smart contracts are an absolutely terrible idea. Relying on code as the source of truth for a transaction just completely disregards the reality that code is always going to be buggy. For those who might not be aware, this is the same smart contract framework where someone accidentally killed $300 million of transactions because a function in a library for setting the wallet associated with a private key was defined as public instead of private: https://medium.com/cybermiles/i-accidentally-killed-it-and-e...Yes, you can fix issues like this with a \"hard fork\" if you have a large enough consensus, but at that point, does the system of having smart contracts actually improve anything over the one where the software is downstream rather than the source of truth, or are you just replacing one form of \"human intervention required\" with a different but worse one?reply",
      "As opposed to being subject to interpretation of the truth, with the courts of varying quality. My point is... everything has error bars.reply",
      "It must. Things that interact with the real world need slack.reply",
      "This is about a language compiler bug. There are no takeaways about smart contracts here.reply",
      "So long as you\u2019re writing your smart contracts with a chisel, into a stone tablet, with no compilers or assemblers in sight!reply",
      "The bug was a simple segfault and did not result in the production of invalid or incorrect code.reply",
      "It's about a compiler bug in C++ that had downstream effects in the compiler for Solidity, which is a language for developing smart contracts. Yes, every compiler can have bugs, even ones not relating to smart contracts, but that doesn't seem like a very convincing argument that we should be using compilers for more things rather than boring regular code that isn't considered to be contractual.reply"

      "Most of the comments seem to confirm (all but one at time of writing) that this feature is more intended for corporate/business environments. Does anyone know if Vaultwarden has commercial users? By no means am I arguing against the inclusion of this feature, I'm just curious. Everywhere I've worked that was big enough to use SSO was also wary of selfhosting FOSS tools. I should clarify I don't consider myself working in tech, fwiw.reply",
      "SSO is really important in the \"few tools, many users\" case, but just as important in the \"many tools, few users\" case. I'm self hosting dozens of tools, and without SSO I'd have to set up username, password, TOTP and WebAuthn for each and every one of them, my 2FA app would be 90% my own services.With SSO though, it's much simpler. I can just run an OIDC server and log into all my self-hosted services once, and I can use all of them. Vaultwarden is an exception to the rule though, as you can't really bootstrap that in the individual case.Another use case I'm currently exploring is for sharing netflix/prime/disney+ passwords with roommates, partners and friends. They just sign in with their Google/Apple/whatever account and get access to the shared streaming provider passwords.reply",

      "Adding another +1 to Pocket ID. I looked at a couple of the ones you mentioned but they looked too heavy and complex for what I wanted. Pocket ID does one thing and does it well.reply",

For telco that\u2019s half its use cases, and there is separate random password. Whole Network engineering department was like WTF ? You can\u2019t have single password which is one of important reasons to have SSOA.reply"
