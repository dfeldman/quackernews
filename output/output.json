      "I'm very curious about the jump obfuscation.  Maybe somebody who's done more reverse-engineering can answer this for me:  a) Are unconditional jumps common enough that they couldn't be filtered out with some set of pre-conditions?\n\n  b) It seems like finding the end of a function would be easy, because there's a return.  Is there some way to analyze the stack so that you know where a function is returning to, then look for a call immediately preceding the return address?\n\nApologies if I'm wrong about how this works, I haven't done much x86 assembly programming.\n \nreply",

I'm using Ollama like this:    ollama run hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0\n\nYou can prompt it directly there, but I'm using my LLM tool and the llm-ollama plugin to run and log prompts against it. Once Ollama has loaded the model (from the above command) you can try those with uvx like this:    uvx --with llm-ollama \\\n      llm -m 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' \\\n      'a joke about a pelican and a walrus who run a tea room together'\n\nHere's what I got - the joke itself is rubbish but the \"thinking\" section is fascinating: https://gist.github.com/simonw/f505ce733a435c8fc8fdf3448e381...I also set an alias for the model like this:    llm aliases set r1l 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' \n\nNow I can run \"llm -m r1l\" (for R1 Llama) instead.I wrote up my experiments so far on my blog: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/\n \nreply",

      "There is currently a risk asymmetry in startup world that drives away people who could do good work.Investors know the long odds of success, so they invest in twenty to thirty companies and wait for one to get big.Founders and employees can't diversify like that, because you only have so many working years. To mitigate this we have decided to award successful founders with huge paydays as a lure to others to throw their hats in the ring. This has some malign effects, namely unsuccessful founders and employees get bupkis. It also attracts the wrong sort of personality to be a founder, selecting for too much risk appetite. (At least what I consider the wrong sort for building a sustainably profitable business.)I have an idea for how to solve this and I wonder if it's already been tried or if there are holes in it. The idea is to spread the risk of starting a company across something like an accelerator class. If one company in that class gets big, it would be contractually obligated to hire and grant shares from some pool to other members of that class. This would be at the cost of the winning founders' stakes.The upside for winners would be much lower, but the downside would be lower too. This would attract a different sort of person to this accelerator, and be a differentiator for selecting talent.\n \nreply",
      "This line in the article resonated with me:> First, it sets the stage for what was to come, and second, while it was unquestionably a success, it was not my success.I used to think that success was being successful the way I wanted and I was often frustrated because things were working but not because of the way I wanted them to. Turns out, it's doubly difficult to make things not only work but also work the way I want.I've since tried to be more open-minded and see wins that perhaps I didn't expect or want still as wins and it's made me feel a lot more successful. One might scoff and say I should hold myself to a higher standard, but at the end of the day, success is only an intrinsic feeling anyways. It's not a measurable metric so I might as well feel better about the progress I'm making.In the context of the article, the author could see these all as failures, but it sounds like some of these were pretty successful.

Describing exactly what I did that day, my thoughts, etc, as best I can.I had thought of doing the journal entries digitally and gathering dictionary headwords from such journal entries, whether they're written in my mother tongue (English) or not, and use the built dictionary lists to drill vocab.Traditionally you'd use a lemmatizer with a morphosyntactic tagger for the language to identify the dictionary words, but AI is serviceable these days to easily identify dictionary words from long-form text in many languages, though honestly would be surprised if AI outperforms the traditional methods already.Good luck and have fun :)\n \nreply",

      "Honestly had never even heard of it! But adult language acquisition isn't really a domain of study I've ever been interested in. I can only speak to what I have found most helpful in my own adult language acquisition journeys.

      "Interesting approach! Thanks for making it open-source, I think we need more open-language language learning tools. As I'm also building one (https://github.com/laurentlb/lingostories/), I'm going to take a look at what you did and the technical decisions.You seem to focus on the English use-case. In my experience, getting exposure to other languages can be much more difficult, especially when you're not fluent yet. It would be interesting to see how to approach it: ideally, questions and answers should be in the target language, but the questions have to be very simple.As someone else mentioned, having audio would be very useful. At some point, you could consider a hand-free mode: it reads the question out loud, pauses a few seconds, then tells the response.\n \nreply",
      "Great work, I had a similar need, and built a similar app (using podcasts) [1]I originally planned to add some kind of SRS to it, but I found that I learned much better just reading things in context instead of explicitly using SRS to memorize them.

      "Thank you so much both for your comment and for sharing your app! (there are definitely great tools out there that we're not aware of) I am very happy to find your app because I actually needed something like this! I enjoy listening while working and being able to see the transcription alongside it, with word definitions in context - this kind of learning really works for me! It's fantastic how it supports all those languages - you can listen, read, and look up definitions all in one place. Looking at this, the one I shared above looked very basic. You handle transcription, media playing, testing pronouncation, LLM interaction I guess for contextual meaning and examples... ! The only question I have (sorry if this already exists - but i couln't find it) but is there a chance I can see a list of words I've encountered and marked as known?And for the second part, I'm planning to include SRS features @markvdb pointed out in comments, combining both contextual learning with SRS would be interested I guess.\n \nreply",

      "Modern interactive fiction is pretty amazing.I like Zork a lot, but I've never made it even halfway through the game. Knowing that you can permanently lose by doing certain things (does breaking the mirror count? I can't remember) puts a damper on my enthusiasm. The infocom parser is pretty good, but I sometimes run into issues where I know what I need to do, but can't get the parser to accept my commands. This happened in planetfall where I needed to get a key under a grate, but eventually gave up and looked up what the parser wanted.Some modern additions are automatic maps and fast travel so you don't get lost in an infinite labyrinth and have to write your own maps (it was fun once, but I wouldn't want to do it each game). Fast travel is nice, so I can get back somewhere without having to type N N E NE N and so on.As for this thread and more relevant comments, I had no idea the parser variables were named after the authors. HN knowledge never ceases to amaze me. I wish there was a convention or something once a year.\n \nreply",
      "I was 15yo in 1977 when our two school paper terminals connected to a Milwaukee Public Schools PDP-11 provided access to the FORTRAN version of DUNGEO, aka mainframe Zork.Memorizing the map was considered a high calling among the half dozen students who became obsessed with the games (ADVENT aka Adventure or Colossal Cave was also on the PDP).At that time, death was just a part of the puzzles of the game. Repetition was not a hindrance.Of course we did learn how to save, but you could only have one save file at a time.Then we learned how to \u201cdetach\u201d our session (RSTS/E operating system) and rename save files as well as holding a current game\u2019s state until we later reattached that session.Mind you this was all on green bar paper.I\u2019m still involved in the IF community, board member of the IFTF, and will occasionally try to play Dungeon from memory.Even made a map a few years ago.https://plover.net/~dave/DungeonMap.pdfI think any gamer worth their salt should take on the challenge.I also think Dungeon would be a great challenge for teenagers in a computer science class.\n \nreply",

      "> no way of running actions locallyMy policy is to never let pipeline DSLs contain any actual logic outside orchestration for the task, relying solely on one-liner build or test commands. If the task is more complicated than a one-liner, make a script for it in the repo to make it a one-liner. Doesn't matter if it's GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps (which has super cursed yaml), etc.This in turn means that you can do what the pipeline does with a one-liner too, whether manually, from a vscode launch command, a git hook, etc.This same approach can fix the mess of path-specific validation too - write a regular script (shell, python, JS, whatever you fancy) that checks what has changed and calls the appropriate validation script. The GitHub action is only used to run the script on PR and to prepare the CI container for whatever the script needs, and the same pipeline will always run.\n \nreply",
      "The reason why many CI configs devolve into such a mess isn't typically that they don't extract complicated logic into scripts, it's about all the interactions with the CI system itself. This includes caching, sharing of artifacts, generating reports, configuring permissions, ordering of jobs, deciding when which jobs will run, deciding what to do when jobs fail, etc. All of this can get quite messy in a large enough project.\n \nreply",
      "You should generate your report with regular scripts. You need ci config to deploy them but that is the only part that should be different.\n \nreply",
      "It never becomes unbearably messy this way though.The reason it gets unbearably messy is because most people google \"how to do x in github actions\" (e.g. send a slack message) and there is a way and it's almost always worse than scripting it yourself.\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019ll go so far as to say the massive add on/plugin list and featuritis of CI/CD tools is actively harmful to the sanity of your team.The only functionality a CI tool should be providing is:- starting and running an environment to build shit in- accurately tracking success or failure- accurate association of builds with artifacts- telemetry (either their own or integration) and audit trails- correlation with project planning software- scheduled builds- build chainingThat\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s a lot less than any CI tool made in the last 15 years does, and that\u2019s enough.There\u2019s a big difference for instance between having a tool that understands Maven information enough to present a build summary, and one with a Maven fetch/push task. The latter is a black box you can\u2019t test locally, and your lead devs can\u2019t either, so when it breaks, it triggers helplessness.If the only answer to a build failure is to stare at config and wait for enlightenment, you fucked up.\n \nreply",

Compiling all rendered knowledge into a single step is the easiest way to ensure all elements around the build and deployment lifecycle work in unison and are guarded around failures.\n \nreply",
      "100%. The ci/cd job should be nothing more than a wrapper around the actual logic which is code in your repo.I write a script called `deploy.sh` which is my wrapper for my ci/cd jobs. It takes options and uses those options to find the piece of code to run.The ci/cd job can be parameterized or matrixed. The eventually-run individual jobs have arguments, and those are passed to deploy.sh. Secrets/environment variables are set from the ci/cd system, also parameterized/matrixed (or alternately, a self-hosted runner can provide deploy.sh access to a vault).End result: from my laptop I can run `deploy.sh deploy --env test --modules webserver` to deploy the webserver to test, and the CI/CD job also runs the same job the same way. The only thing I maintain that's CI/CD-specific is the GitHub Action-specific logic of how to get ready to run `deploy.sh`, which I write once and never change. Thus I could use 20 different CI/CD systems, but never have to refactor my actual deployment code, which also always works on my laptop. Vendor lock-in is impossible, thanks to a little abstraction.(If you have ever worked with a team with 1,000 Jenkins jobs and the team has basically decided they can never move off of Jenkins because it would take too much work to rewrite all the jobs, you'll understand why I do it this way)\n \nreply",

There will be folks who say GitHub Actions are great (I also use them for smaller projects), but as with any tool, it has limits and might not be suitable for all problems. Let's look at some of them.Our code sits in a monorepo which is further divided into folders. Every folder is independent of each other and can be tested, built, and deployed separately.Each of these folders has its pipeline.
