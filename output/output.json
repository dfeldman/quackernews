You get a messaging app and it can send messages to people on Facebook, Twitter, SMS, etc. all in the same interface. It can download the things in \"your feed\" and then put it in a different order, or filter things out, and again show content from multiple services in the same interface, including RSS.

      "The byte-for-byte identical output requirement is the smartest part of this whole thing. You basically get to run the old and new pipelines side by side and diff them, which means any bug in the translation is immediately caught. Way too many rewrites fail because people try to \"improve\" things during the port and end up chasing phantom bugs that might be in the old code, the new code, or just behavioral differences.Also worth noting that \"translated from C++\" Rust is totally fine as a starting point. You can incrementally make it more idiomatic later once the C++ side is retired. The Rust compiler will still catch whole classes of memory bugs even if the code reads a bit weird. That's the whole point.reply",
      "> Way too many rewrites fail because people try to \"improve\" things during the port\n\nI'd say that porting is a great time to \"improve\" many things, but like you suggest, not a great time to add new features. You can do a lot of improvements while maintaining output parity. You're in the weeds, reading the code, thinking about the routines, and you have all the hindsight of having done it already. Features are great to add as comments that sketch things out but importantly this is a great time to find and recognize that maybe a subroutine is pretty inefficient. I mean the big problem in writing software is that the goal are ever evolving. You wrote the software for different goals, different constraints. So a great time to clean things up, make them more flexible, more readable, *AND TO DOCUMENT*.I think the last one gets ignored easily but my favorite time to document code is when reading it (but the best time is when writing it). It forces you to think explicitly about what the code is doing and makes it harder for the little things to slip by. Given that Ladybird is a popular project I really do think good documentation is a way to accelerate its development. Good documentation means new people can come in and contribute faster and with fewer errors. It lowers the barrier to entry, substantially. It's also helpful for all the mere mortals who forget thingsreply",
      "LLMs are great at producing documentation - ask one \"hey can you add a TODO comment about the thing on line 847 that is probably not the best way to do this?\" while you're working on the port, and it will craft a reasonably-legible comment about that thing without further thought from you, that will make things easier for the person (possibly future-you) looking at the codebase for improvements to make. Meanwhile, you keep on working on the port that has byte-for-byte identical output.reply",

      "One of the biggest point of rewriting is you know better by then so you create something better.This is a HUUUGE reason code written in rust tended to be so much better than the original (which was probably written in c++).Human expertise is the single most important factor and is more important than language.Copy pasting from one language to another is way worse than complete rewrite  with actual idiomatic and useful code.Best option after proper rewrite is binding. And copy-paste with LLM comes way below these options imo.If you look at real world, basically all value is created by boring and hated languages.

We previously explored Swift, but the C++ interop never quite got there, and platform support outside the Apple ecosystem was limited. Rust is a different story. The ecosystem is far more mature for systems programming, and many of our contributors already know the language. Going forward, we are rewriting parts of Ladybird in Rust.When we originally evaluated Rust back in 2024, we rejected it because it\u2019s not great at C++ style OOP. The web platform object model inherits a lot of 1990s OOP flavor, with garbage collection, deep inheritance hierarchies, and so on. Rust\u2019s ownership model is not a natural fit for that.But after another year of treading water, it\u2019s time to make the pragmatic choice. Rust has the ecosystem and the safety guarantees we need. Both Firefox and Chromium have already begun introducing Rust into their codebases, and we think it"

      "So many, where to begin.1. People don't design schemas to be sharded, although many gravitate towards a common key, e.g. user_id or country_id or tenant_it or customer_id. Once that happens, sharding becomes easier.2. Postgres provides a lot of guarantees that are tricky to maintain when sharded: atomic changes, referential integrity, check constraints, unique indexes (and constraints), to name a few. Those have to be built separately by a sharding layer (like PgDog) and have trade-offs, usually around performance. It's a lot more expensive to check a globally enforced constraint than a local one (network hops aren't free).3. Online migrations from unsharded to sharded can be tricky: you have to redistribute terabytes of data while the DB continues to serve writes. You can't lose a single row - Postgres is used as a store of record and this can be a serious issue with business impact.We're taking increasingly bigger bites at this apple. We started with basic query routing and are now doing query rewrites as well. We didn't handle data movements previously and now have almost fully automatic resharding. It takes time, elbow grease and most importantly, willing and courageous early adopters to whom we owe a huge debt of gratitude.reply"

      "I think the confusion is because strictly speaking $f(x) = O(g(x))$ is an abuse of notation. $O(g(n)), \\Theta(g(n))$ and friends are sets. We can't say that a function equals a set, or that a function \"is less\" than another function, but notoriously mathematics runs on javascript, so we try to do something instead of giving a type error.Here \"is less\" is interpreted as \"eventually less for all values\" and \"plus a set\" is interpreted as \"plus any function of that set\".I never liked this notation for asymptotics and I always preferred the $f(x) \\in O(g(x))$ style, but it's just notation in the end.reply",
      "The reason it's preferred to use \"=\" instead of \"\\in\" is because the way that Landau notation is generally used in practice is as a kind of ellipsis or placeholder. For example, the Taylor expansion e^x = 1 + x + O(x^2). I could just as well write e^x = 1 + x + ..., but the former conveys more meaning about what is hidden behind the ellipsis. It's an abuse of notation, but in the contexts that it's used, it's not clear what additional clarity using \"\\in\" would bring over \"=\". Maybe also that big O is mainly used as a notation to facilitate doing calculations, less describing what family a function belongs to. Here are Knuth's thoughts, which I agree with: https://micromath.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/donald-knuth-calc...reply",
      "To me it seems similar to the + C on an antiderivative (or more generally, quotient objects). Technically, you are dealing with an equivalence class of functions, so a set. But it's usually counterproductive to think of it that way (and when you study this stuff properly, one of the first things you do is prove that you (usually) don't need to, and can instead use an arbitrary representative as a stand-in for the set), so you write F(x)+C.reply",
      "I think the Landau notation is a bit more finicky with the details. When it's really a quotient (like modular arithmetic) I'm with you, but here $O()$ morally means \"at most this\" and often you have to use the \"direction of the inequality\" to prove complexity bounds, so I'm more comfortable with the set notation. But again, it's just notation, I could use either.reply",
      "Huh, never thought about the potential connection between the set-containment operation and Stokes like that.reply",
      "It's actually a linear (more generally, abstract) algebra thing. (All, Differentiable, Smooth, or all sorts of other sets of) functions form a vector space. The derivative is a linear operator (generalized matrix). If you have a linear equation Ax=b, then if you can find some solution X, the general solution set is X+kerA, where kerA (the kernel or nullspace) is the set of all v where Av=0. What's the kernel of the derivative operator (i.e. what has 0 derivative)? Constant functions. So the general solution is whatever particular antiderivative you find plus any constant function.You can do this sort of \"particular solution plus kernel\" analysis on any linear operator, which gives one strategy for solving linear differential equations. e.g. (aD^2+bD+cI) is a linear operator (weighted sums and compositions of linear operators are linear), so you can potentially do that analysis to solve problems like af''+bf'+cf=g. In that context you say the general solution is to add a homogeneous solution (af''+bf'+cf=0) to a particular solution (my intro differential equations class covered this but didn't have linear algebra as a prereq so naturally at the time it was just magic, like everything else presented in intro diffeq).reply",
      "Indeed, the connection to Stokes here is via the fact that both operators (abstracted derivative and antiderivative) are linear operators.reply",
      "it basically works outside of linear algebra also. For instance the function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 has as its 'kernel' the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1.reply",

Maybe emphasize that somehow, and/or support Backspace too for backnav?- Enter on Domains menu item does not work- don't mention clicking if mouse is not supported. \"Select\" would be more appropriate- packets screen is truncated vertically and horizontally. Probably should be scrollable- \"weird stuff\" options are numbered 1-5, but pressing those keys has no effect. There's lots of little polish fixes like this.---And then things I wonder about as a novice user:- Is it possible to see domain names instead of IP addresses while e.g. looking at packets?- What does it mean to f stream?- How do I inspect packets? Especially compressed or encrypted data? This is more a knowledge gap, like \"what am I supposed to look for\", \"what could be in a packet\", and I guess involves reverse engineering sometimes, but it's also a tooling question.reply",
      "Thanks a lot for trying. My experience with packet inspection is similar and that's what resulted in me trying to build a simpler plain language UI companion.\u2022 Back navigation: good call.

If you can share your OS/terminal + whether you installed from release vs cargo install, I'll try to reproduce and fix in the next release.\u2022 \"Clicking\" wording: agreed \u2014 mouse isn't supported right now. I'll change Ul copy to say Select (and keep \"Enter = drill down\").\u2022 Packets screen truncation: yep, needs scrolling/paging. On the list views I already do r/; l'll add page scroll and horizontal handling where it makes sense.\u2022 Numbered weird options: great idea - I'll map 1..9 to jump-select and Enter (or open directly).\u2022 Domain names in packets: yes, I want that. I already collect DNS/SNI/HTTP host hints; next step is showing hostname labels alongside IPs when I have more confident mapping.\u2022 \"f stream\" definition: I'll clarify it as \"Follow stream (reassembled payload)\" and add a glossary/help entry.\u2022 Inspecting encrypted/compressed data: totally fair. The tool can't decrypt TLS without keys, but it can make it clearer what's happening (SNI/ ALPN, sizes, timing, resets/retransmits).

      "> The hardware is built around a stackable 10\u00d710cm compute module with two ARM Cortex-A55 SBCs \u2014 one for ROS 2 navigation/EKF localisation, one dedicated to vision/YOLO inference \u2014 connected via a single ethernet cable.I will preface this by saying that I have nothing against ARM per se, that my employer/team supported a good chunk of the work for making ROS 2 actually work on arm64, and that there is some good hardware out there.I really don't understand why startups and research projects keep using weird ARM SBCs for their robots. The best of these SBCs is still vastly shittier in terms of software support and stability than any random Chinese Intel ADL-N box. The only reasons to use (weird) ARM SBCs in robots are that either (1) you are using a Jetson for Jetson things (i.e. Nvidia libraries), or (2) you have a product which requires serious cost optimization to be produced at a large scale. Otherwise you are just committing yourselves and your users/customers to a future of terrible-to-nonexistent support and adding significantly to the amount of work you need to bring up the new system and port existing tools to it.reply",
      "If you can send me an open hardware Intel, or Jetson I'd happily use it.Part of the point of this for me is to see what's possible with open hardware (down to chip level at least)reply",
      "There are a variety of x86 products with Coreboot support, if what you are looking for is firmware openness. If what you are looking for is PCB design openness, the options are much fewer, but at that point you are probably optimizing for an overly niche objective.> Part of the point of this for me is to see what's possible with open hardware (down to chip level at least)I appreciate the idea, but this is essentially saying \"this project will prioritize a specific choice of one (core) piece of hardware to the detriment of everything else, users included\". Approximately none of your potential users are going to benefit from the \"openness\" of the SBC versus that of a more broadly-supported platform (I say \"openness\" because the reality of SBCs is that actually finding a usefully performant one that is completely blob-free is almost impossible). Open hardware means very little if it isn't running an upstream kernel and userland.reply",
      "The software does explicitly support Jetson for example, and I'm sure the stack would run on Intel if you want it to.The Mainline kernel for this particular board is _almost_ there 6.20 or so I expect. Armbian support is good.reply",
      "Framework? Maybe?reply",
      "Framweork have done the best they can within the confines of Intel licensing, still a long way from being able to fabricate it thoughhttps://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Laptop-13/tre...In a few years we'll all be using more open RISCV stuff of course.reply",
      "> The only reasons to use ARM SBCs in robots are...Obviously, anyone can have there own opinion on this.  \nI work in robotics, we are quite happy with our A53 and M4.  Though, we use a SOM, not a SBC, if you feel like splitting hairs.reply",
      "You probably aren't using some weird SOM, though. There is a bit of an unstated exception of \"unless said SBC/SOM has specific hardware that is necessary/particularly valuable for your product/project\". For example, if you need GMSL you are probably not going to be picking Intel, even though ADL-N and the bigger processors support MIPI, simply because no one else does and the documentation/support for it is basically nonexistent. Designs with closely-coupled A/M/R cores, or CPU/MCU/FPGA hybrids like Zynq would be others.But generally projects which are choosing some random SBC aren't using any of these features, and are just suffering the pain/imposing it on their users for no good reason.reply"

      "As someone who is roughly in the same age group as the author and who was running a BBS, has witnessed the rise of IP4 networks, HTTP, Mosaic etc. let me provide a counter-point.The democratization ends at your router. Unless you are willing to lay down your own wires - which for legal reasons you most likely won't be able to do, we will hopelessly be dependent on the ISP. (Radio on free frequencies is possible and there are valiant attempts, they will ultimately remain niche and have severe bandwidth limitations)For decades ISP have throttled upload speeds: they don't want you to run services over their lines. \nWhen DSL was around (I guess it still is) in Germany, there was a mandatory 24h disconnect. \nISP control what you can see and how fast you can see it. They should be subject to heavy regulation to ensure a free internet.The large networks, trans-atlantic, trans-pacific cables, all that stuff is beyond the control of individuals and even countries. If they don't like your HTTP(S) traffic, the rest of the world won't see it.So what you can own is your local network. Using hardware that is free of back-doors and remote control.\nThere's no guarantee for that. If you are being targeted even the Rasperry Pi you just ordered might be compromised.\nWe should demand from our legislators that hardware like this is free of back-doors.As to content creation: There are so so many tools available that allow non-technical users to write and publish. There's no crisis here other than picking the best tool for the job.In short: there's no hope of getting a world-wide, free, uncensored, unlimited IP4/6 network back. We never had it in the first place.reply",
      "There is hope. It's not only possible, but it is likely and is already underway. DNS can be replaced. IPv4/v6 can be replaced.
