      "I once published a method for finding the closest distance between an ellipse and a point on SO: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22959698/distance-from-g...I consider it the most beautiful piece of code I've ever written and perhaps my one minor contribution to human knowledge. It uses a method I invented, is just a few lines, and converges in very few iterations.People used to reach out to me all the time with uses they had found for it, it was cited in a PhD and apparently lives in some collision plugin for unity. Haven't heard from anyone in a long time.It's also my test question for LLMs, and I've yet to see my solution regurgitated. Instead they generate some variant of Newtons method, ChatGPT 5.2 gave me an LM implementation and acknowledged that Newtons method is unstable (it is, which is why I went down the rabbit hole in the first place.)Today I don't know where I would publish such a gem. It's not something I'd bother writing up in a paper, and SO was the obvious place were people who wanted an answer to this question would look. Now there is no central repository, instead everyone individually summons the ghosts of those passed in loneliness.reply",
      "The various admonitions to publish to a personal blog, while encouraging, don't really get at the 0xfaded's request which I'd summarize as follows:With no one asking questions these technical questions publicly, where, how and on what public platform will technical people find the problems that need solving so they can exercise their creativity for the benefit of all?reply",
      "Seriously where will we get this info anymore? I\u2019ve depended on it for decades. No matter how obscure, I could always find a community that was talking about something I needed solved. I feel like that\u2019s getting harder and harder every year. The balkanization of the Internet + garbage AI slop blogs overwhelming the clearly declining Google is a huge problem.reply",
      "You can write a paper, submit the arxiv, and you can also make a blog post. \nAt any rate, I agree - SO was (is?) a wonderful place for this kind of thing.I once had a professor mention that they knew me from SO because I posted a few underhanded tricks to prevent an EKF from \"going singular\" in production. That kind of community is going to be hard to replace, but SO isnt going anywhere, you can still ask a question and answer your own question for permanent, searchable archive.reply",
      "Please, start a blog! Hugo + GitHub hosting makes it laughably simple. (Or pick a different stack; that\u2019s just mine.)Even if you\u2019re worried it\u2019ll be sparse and crappy, isn\u2019t an Internet full of idiosyncratic personal blogs what we all want?If you want help or encouragement, reach out: zellyn@ most placesreply",
      "It's been a long time, but here is the writeup https://blog.chatfield.io/simple-method-for-distance-to-elli...reply",
      "You should write it up and submit it to some journal officially.  Doesn't matter if it mostly duplicates your own (technically unpublished) work.reply",
      "I too, around 2012 was too much active on so, in fact, it had that counter thing continuously xyz days  most of my one liners, or snippets for php are still the highest voted answers. Even now when sometimes I google something, and an answer comes up, I realize its me who asked the same question and answered it too.reply",
      "I have had this experience -- twice with the same answer. There is nothing so amusing in quite this way.reply",
      "Some comments:- This is a really remarkable graph. I just didn't realize how thoroughly it was over for SO. It stuns me as much as when Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica stopped selling print versions a mere 9 years after the publication of Wikipedia, but at an even faster timescale.- I disagree with most comments that the brusque moderation is the cause of SO's problems, though it certainly didn't help. SO has had poor moderation from the beginning. The fundamental value proposition of SO is getting an answer to a question; if you can the same answer faster, you don't need SO. I suspect that the gradual decline, beginning around 2016, is due to growth in a number of other sources of answers. Reddit is kind of a dark horse here, as I began seeing answers on Google to more modern technical questions link to a Reddit thread frequently along with SO from 2016 onwards. I also suspect Discord played a part, though this is harder to gauge; I certainly got a number of answers to questions for, e.g., Bun, by asking around in the Bun Discord, etc. The final nail in the coffin is of course LLMs, which can offer a SO-level answer to a decent percentage of questions instantly. (The fact that the LLM doesn't insult you is just the cherry on top.)- I know I'm beating a dead horse here, but what happens now? Despite stratification I mentioned above, SO was by far the leading source of high quality answers to technical questions. What do LLMs train off of now? I wonder if, 10 years from now, LLMs will still be answering questions that were answered in the halcyon 2014-2020 days of SO better than anything that came after? Or will we find new, better ways to find answers to technical questions?reply"

Could it generate the rest of each piece in a similar fashion?I only compared a handful of posts from their AI versions to their originals, but I quickly concluded the writing suffered from the same uncanny valley effect as many AI-generated images: It all looks fine enough at first glance, but pay attention just a little longer, and something feels off. The AI would veer off in a different direction or end up making the opposite argument. It sounded confident where I would have been doubtful and vice versa.

The IDE compiles Swift, generates a full Android project ready for Android Studio.This is the first public release. Both tooling and framework are open-source and MIT-licensed.reply",

I expect teams would always still end up with two codebases, with enough differences and workarounds to make it that you might as well just enjoy using Kotlin or Swift as you need to. Knowing two languages isn\u2019t all that bad. Most developers learn many languages during their careers and switch between them without a thought.

For example, John Graham-Cumming blogged while he was the CTO of Cloudflare, so I count his personal blog but not his posts to the Cloudflare company blog.For the third straight year, Simon Willison was the most popular blogger on Hacker News.At first, Simon\u2019s position at #1 feels obvious: he wrote about AI in a year when everyone\u2019s obsessed with AI. But there are tons of AI bloggers, and Simon is the only one who\u2019s popular on HN, so what sets Simon apart?First, Simon isn\u2019t selling you anything.

You can do this by aiming for the smallest, easiest, and simplest first step that simultaneously maximises progress towards the goal. e.g. \"I want to make a stand to hold my XYZ.\" Bad first step: Buy a 3D printer.

      "I've been following C3 for sometime now, and I really appreciate the discipline in the design philosophy here.Neither does it force a new memory model on you, nor does it try to be C++. The killer feature for me is the full ABI compatibility. The fact that I no longer have to write bindings and can just mix C3 files into my existing C build system reduces the friction to near zero.Kudos to the maintainer for sticking to the evolution, not revolution vision. If you are looking for a weekend language to learn that doesn't require resetting your brain but feels more modern than C99, I highly recommend giving this a shot. Great work by the team.reply",
      "But can I still write a library in C3 and export the symbols to use in bindings?The only thing stopping me from just going full C the rest of my career is cstrings and dangling pointers to raw memory that isn\u2019t cleaned up when the process ends.reply",

      "Dumb question about contracts: I was reading the docs (https://c3-lang.org/language-common/contracts/) and this jumped out\"Contracts are optional pre- and post-condition checks that the compiler may use for static analysis, runtime checks and optimization. Note that conforming C3 compilers are not obliged to use pre- and post-conditions at all.However, violating either pre- or post-conditions is unspecified behaviour, and a compiler may optimize code as if they are always true \u2013 even if a potential bug may cause them to be violated.In safe mode, pre- and post-conditions are checked using runtime asserts.\"So I'm probably missing something, but it reads to me like you're adding checks to your code, except there's no guarantee that they will run and whether it's at compile or runtime. And sometimes instead of catching a mistake, these checks will instead silently introduce undefined behaviour into your program. Isn't that kinda bad? How are you supposed to use this stuff reliably?(otherwise C3 seems really cool!)reply",
      "Contracts are a way to express invariants, \"This shall always be true\".There are three main things you could do with these invariants, the exact details of how to do them, and whether people should be allowed to specify which of these things to do, and if so whether they can pick only for a whole program, per-file, per-function, or whatever, is separate.1. Ignore the invariants. You wrote them down, a human can read them, but the machine doesn't care. You might just as well use comments or annotate the documentation, and indeed some people do.2. Check the invariants. If the invariant wasn't true then something went wrong and we might tell somebody about that.3. Assume these invariants are always true. Therefore the optimiser may use them to emit machine code which is smaller or faster but only works if these invariants were correct.So for example maybe a language lets you say only that the whole program is checked, or, that the whole program can be assumed true, or, maybe the language lets you pick, function A's contract about pointer validity we're going to check at runtime, but function B's contract that you must pick an odd number, we will use assumption, we did tell you about that odd number requirement, have the optimiser emit that slightly faster machine code which doesn't work for N=0 -- because zero isn't an odd number assumption means it's now fine to use that code.reply"

In fact, one of my silly little games became moderately popular because someone found it in my RSS feed and shared it on HN. [1]From the referer (sic) data in my web server logs (which is not completely reliable but still offers some insight), the three largest sources of traffic to my website are:1. RSS feeds - People using RSS aggregator services as well as local RSS reader tools.2. Newsletters - I was surprised to discover just how many tech newsletters there are on the Web and how active their user bases are. Once in a while, a newsletter picks up one of my silly or quirky posts, which then brings a large number of visits from its followers.3. Search engines - Traffic from Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing and similar search engines.

      "Definitely interesting, I don't see an obvious comment on hardware requirements, do you know what those are?I've played around with OSRM, and Nominatim, etc, but had to do some trickery to run on a raspberry pi.(For anyone interested in running some of these kind of things on a pi, I talk about it generally here, I need to post an update with more info at some point.\nhttp://blog.onaclovtech.com/2025/02/general-purpose-to-speci...)reply",
      "I do not have published benchmarks yet (I want to collect a few real region packs first and then write this up properly).One goal of Corviont is to avoid the on-device pain you hit with OSRM/Nominatim: the region pack is built once elsewhere, and the edge box mostly just serves prebuilt artifacts (PMTiles tiles, Valhalla routing tiles, and a SQLite geocoder index based on Nominatim).In practice, requirements scale with region size and traffic. For larger regions the main constraint is usually SSD storage plus enough RAM headroom for routing/cache. I also picked Valhalla partly because it generally has a smaller RAM footprint than OSRM at serving time (OSRM is extremely fast but tends to be more memory-hungry).reply",
      "I like how you packed only the necessities - tiles for maps, routing, and geocoding index in in sqlite. I checked the monaco deployment and missed lookup with street number, as someone else also pointed out.Why not create a \"builder\" repo, where people could generate their own local datasets by a bounding box?reply",
      "Yeah, house-number lookup is not there yet. The demo geocoder does place/street-level search + reverse, but house numbers need a richer address index - it's on the roadmap.Re: a bbox \"builder\" repo - it's an interesting idea. I could see it going two ways: (a) you want to run a bbox builder yourself, or (b) you want a simple way to specify a bbox so the dataset pack can be produced for you.I started with the \"ship a known-good pack\" approach because the build pipeline is the messy part, and I want deployed boxes to stay simple/reproducible.For your use case, which did you mean - run the build locally, or \"draw/paste a bbox and get back a ready-to-run pack\"? And would bbox be OK, or do you prefer admin boundaries (country/state/city)?reply",
      "I love it, thanks!If I may have a feature request, I\u2019d like to have only some of the features turned on - in my case it would be just the reverse geocoder (so I could skip the map and routing data download and storage).Right now I have my own reverse geocoder for https://weathergraph.app which downloads OSM dumps and builds in-memory KD tree for lookups. Surprisingly, the whole world can fit in 3-4 GB of RAM, and service starts in 90 seconds on a cheap VPS, no database needed, but of course, having a battle tested solution that just works (and someone else maintains it) would help.reply",
      "Thank you! And yes, Corviont is intentionally a stack of separable services behind one gateway - so \"geocoder-only\" is exactly the kind of config I want to support (skip PMTiles + Valhalla and ship only the SQLite index + reverse API).Re: Weathergraph - thanks for the details. Since you already run whole-world reverse geocoding on a single server, that's a bit different from Corviont's current regional/fleet packaging (where you ship only the area you need to each edge/on-prem deployment). A \"world geocoder-only\" pack could still make sense - but it's a different distribution/update story than my default.For your use case, do you want reverse results at the city/region/country level - or do you also need street/house number detail? That choice mostly determines how heavy a world geocoder-only pack needs to be.reply",
      "This is super cool. I\u2019ve been kicking around an idea for ages regarding tile-based routing that I think would be excellent for offline routing. You could leverage the quadtree aspect of tiling to encapsulate faster, direct routes (ie highways) and as you go to deeper zoom levels you\u2019d unlock small roads - even down to pathways. This keeps your in-memory graph small while traversing large distances (which would just be highways anyways) and once you eliminated most of the distance your remaining graph traversal on local roads would be smallreply",
      "You might enjoy reading the papers \"Highway Hierarchies Hasten Exact Shortest Path Queries\" [1] and \"Exact Routing in Large Road Networks using Contraction Hierarchies\" [2] if you're interested in hierarchical approaches to shortest path routing.The algorithms do divide the map up into chunks that are themselves divided up and so on, but not on the strict geographical basis a quadtree uses. You might not want to divide Manhattan in two for routing purposes, even if the 74th longitude line runs straight through it.[1] https://turing.iem.thm.de/routeplanning/hwy/esaHwyHierarchie...\n[2] https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000028701/14297392...reply",
      "That\u2019s a really interesting framing - you\u2019re basically describing hierarchical routing / \"zoom-level\" graphs: do the long leg on a coarse network (highways), then refine locally as you get closer to origin/destination.FWIW, Valhalla already does a version of this: it partitions the routing graph into hierarchical tiles and runs with multiple hierarchy levels (highway / arterial / local) specifically to keep search + in-memory working set smaller on long routes: https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla/tiles/The \"quadtree tile unlock\" mental model is a nice way to think about it though - if you have a favorite paper / implementation that leans harder into the tiling aspect, I\u2019d love a pointer. I\u2019m currently focused on packaging + offline data consistency, but routing performance on constrained edge boxes is definitely a core constraint I care about.reply",

      "This is thematically amazing when you consider what the song is about \u2014 the roboticization of the abducted band. (Music video:)https://youtu.be/gAjR4_CbPpQIn this song, which is also chapter four of the movie Interstella 5000 movie (spoilers from here!), the knocked-out singers are scanned, parameterized, brainwashed, uploaded into The Matrix, and then used in the following songs of the movie-album to robotically mass produce music.It makes perfect sense that the BPM is 123.45 because that\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you get when a manager  (who\u2019s shown at the end!) just enters some numbers on the keyboard into the bpm field. They don\u2019t keysmash the numpad; they just hit 123456789 until the field is full!So not only does the song itself convey what some boss thinks is music, robotically beating at 123.45 bpm, but it is itself about being endlessly-rotating brainwashed-boring cogs in a pop music production industrial machine. I\u2019m pretty sure the movie scene cuts and animations are timed specifically to the beats of the song, but knowing that they\u2019re timed to a machine-specific bpm that a human would never select at random with a metronome?Absolute genius.I had no idea. Thanks for posting this.EDIT: At 123.4567bpm, I think the track has precisely 0.2345 seconds of silence before the first 'beat' of the song and actually has 456 beats total, which is either numerological nonsense or pure genius by Daft Punk.

      "Kinda ish. Healthy resting heartbeat is around 60bpm and comfortable exertion heart rate - like doing an indefinitely sustainable run, the kind of thing we evolved to do to run down prey - around double that. The most broadly popular styles of dance music tend to float around 120bpm. It just feels natural to humans. At a guess, some combination of biomechanics (muscle twitch speed, pendulum effect of limb sizes against their articulating joints), heart beat, what most people can manage in terms of sustained exercise (as mentioned above), and attention span linked to multiples of musical phrases.Specifically about keeping tempo, human drummers don't really. They will move around a central tempo, slowing in verses and increasing tempo in choruses and as the song progresses.
