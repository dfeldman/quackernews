ECAM builds rapidly at the atomic level from a water-based feedstock containing dissolved metal ions. The electrochemical approach allows for micron-scale feature resolution, complex internal features, high-purity materials, and rapid scalability to support mass manufacturing. We are  working to broaden the market for metal additive manufacturing by providing advanced manufacturing services that displace traditional manufacturing.\n\n\nTechnology Benefits"

I now got it to a place where I can count on seeing fresh and interesting content a couple of times a day, and the interface conveniently lets me keep what I plan to read and discard the rest."
