      "I would kill for this for when I\u2019m buying fresh produce at the shops. Right now I just raw dog the produce into my basket as putting 4 apples into a plastic bag to ease the weighing and transport home seems like a selfish thing to do to the environment, but something that starts to break down soon after that sounds great.reply",
      "Why don\u2019t you bring plastic bags from home? They are very much reusable, you don\u2019t have to throw them out. They are also quite easy to fold into small shapes and keep on you, or your car, or whatever. I have plastic bags which have endured for literal years. I also decided early on that if I forget to bring a bag, I either do without or have to go back to get one. You start remembering really fast after a few times of forcing yourself to go back.Another thing you can do is just take a cardboard box from some product in the store. This may depend on country, but where I live the shops leave products on their transport boxes on the shelves. Walking around the store I can usually find one empty box, or maybe one almost empty that I can move the products from into another box for the same product next to it. Then I just take the box and use it to transport my groceries. Stores just throw those boxes out anyway, so they don\u2019t care if you take them (I have asked). At this point it\u2019s a bit of a game for me, to guarantee I always find a box. I have a personal rule never do anything that would make the lives of the workers harder in the process.reply",

      "> it can be composted in municipal facilities according to the bagNote that \"according to the bag\" is very different from \"according to your municipality\"; my understanding is that most places actually can't handle them, and they might need to divert your compost to the landfill if it has too much of those plastic bags. They can be composed under certain conditions, but whether the facility your municipality uses has those is unclear.See also \"flushable\" wipes that must not be flushed down the toilet.reply",

They decompose well/without \"microplastics\" but only under correct conditions.Home composts aren't usually meeting these, their temperature isn't going high enough for full decomposition and you can have traces of polymers left behind. I throw them in the trash for compostable waste because thankfully my collectivity collects these to generate biogas and my guess is they do end up in much larger/managed composts where they can fully decompose.reply",

      "Much to the chagrin of my mother, I made it a point about a decade ago to standardize old family recipes on \"from scratch\" versions. As part of the process, I also did some research on old recipes and fixed some of the corruption of these recipes that occurred during the copying and recitation, bolstering them with culinary techniques that were in use at the time. I also captured things that drift over time, such as crude protein and carbohydrate measurements and grind sizes in flour. I provided standardized weights and measurements, in MKS units, preferring mass, when possible, over volume.She's upset that the recipes are different, but when it comes to recipes from the thirties and later based on using a box of this or a can of that, these recipes are resistant to shrinkflation. The downside is that these recipes miss out on the advanced chemistry that went into making these boxed mixes so great to begin with. But, in my opinion, that's a small price to pay for reproducibility.Some recipes, like cakes and cookies, will need to be adjusted once a generation. For these recipes, I include notes about how to tell when certain ingredients are \"off\" so that these can be re-calibrated as ingredients change in the future. Ingredients change. Some are no longer available. Others are derived from newer varieties or hybrids that have different flavor profiles. For instance, bananas taste differently than they did sixty years ago. That old and dusty banana pudding recipe meant to reproduce that amazing pudding that your great-grandmother used to make won't taste the same unless you adjust the amount of isoamyl acetate; modern varieties have less of this compound than the old Gros Michel varieties did. You can occasionally find Gros Michel bananas if you want to taste the difference, but they are no longer a viable cash crop due to their susceptibility to Panama disease.reply",
      "I\u2019ve also digitized some recipes and had to deal with \u201c1 can\u201d or \u201c1 bar\u201d without size included. Some things aren\u2019t sold like that anymore or their size has fluctuated. In the example about it was for a candy bar pound cake and \u201c1 can of Hershey\u2019s syrup\u201d isn\u2019t a thing anymore that I can tell and even if it was, I had no clue the size. Same with \u201c1 Hershey\u2019s bar\u201d, uhh, no clue what 1 standard bar was then. Thankfully my mom was able to fill in the gaps but let this be a lesson, if you have family recipes you love, get it written down with actual units, you\u2019ll thank yourself later.Next on my list is converting everything to mass where possible. It\u2019s so much easier to measure with a kitchen scale than it is to wonder \u201cdid I pack the X in too tight or too loose into this cup?\u201d.reply",
      "She's upset that the recipes are differentIf she's like my mother, she probably thinks of these recipes as a connection to her parents and grandparents. The importance is not in the finished dish, but in the history of this specific artifact, including: the hand writing, the original index cards, the references to the bowls she remembers as a little girl. I understand this. When I see my grandmother's recipes, hand-written in broken English, it makes me smile, because I can't not read it in my grandmother's voice. Ok, these aren't cakes and cookies, so there's no need to be precise, so I do the recipe updates in my head anyway.When updating the recipe, consider this. If you're laying it out on paper, at least keep a reference to the original recipe, a photo, etc. I have a professional cookbook like this. It has excerpts from journals from the 18th or 19th century with the original recipe, and also recontexualizes them for today's ingredients, tools and techniques. You get both the history and the dish.reply",

      "By far, my priority for energy policy, in the US where I live, is to lower the cost of energy.After reading Claim 11, starting on page 29, where the authors state that:>unsubsidized solar energy is now generally cheaper than fossil fuels; and> solar energy compares favorably in terms of levelized cost (total lifetime energy production / total lifetime cost)The authors build this argument over three pages, including several charts, citing a Lazard paper that prices solar at $60/Mwh vs gas combined cycle at $70/MWh. But only in the last paragraph do they concede that when you include the cost of intermittency (firming), solar is only cheaper than gas peaking plant cost ($168/MWh).As someone who lives in New York City and is drowning in inflated energy bills, lacking any engineering explanation why my residential electricity $/MWh is triple that of Beijing, I am sick and tired of phony academic papers such as this that begin with a conclusion and work backward to fabricate extremely misleading arguments.I don\u2019t care how my energy is generated. I strongly prefer it comes from sources that pollute less. But that preference is miles behind the priority for cheaper energy.Bullshit research like this, written by attorneys, including arguments like claim 11 which tries to hide the fact that solar only produces energy during daylight, annd does not account for storage/firming costs are not helping move our national energy dialog forward.reply",
      "So you're saying we can't use solar because at some point, a small percentage of the time (i.e., peaking demand), it's more expensive than an alternative?Did you miss that overall it's still cheaper?There's nothing stopping us from using solar and nuclear as a baseline and firming/peaking with the cheapest fossil fuel. And given the cost reduction in batteries that's been going on, I doubt fossil fuel peaking will still be the cheapest in the next few years.reply",

      "The ship has very much sailed now with ballot SC63, and this is the result, but I still don't think CRLs are remotely a perfect solution (nor do I think OCSP was unfixable). You run into so many problems with the size of them, the updates not propagating immediately etc. It's just an ugly solution to the problem, that you then have to introduce further hacks (Bloom filters) atop of it all to make the whole mess work. I'm glad that Mozilla have done lots of work in this area with CRLite, but it does all feel like a bodge.The advantages of OCSP were that you got a real-time understanding of the status of a certificate and you had no need to download large CRLs which become stale very quickly. If you set security.ocsp.require in the browser appropriately then you didn't have any risk of the browser failing open, either. I did that in the browser I was daily-driving for years and can count on one hand the number of times I ran into OCSP responder outages.The privacy concerns could have been solved through adoption of Must-Staple, and you could then operate the OCSP responders purely for web-servers and folks doing research.And let's not pretend users aren't already sending all the hostnames they are visiting to their selected DNS server. Why is that somehow okay, but OCSP not?reply",
      "The problem with requiring OCSP stapling is that it's not practically enforceable without breakage.The underlying dynamics of any change to the Web ecosystem is that it has to be incrementally deployable, in the sense that when element A changes it doesn't experience breakage with the existing ecosystem. At present, approximately no Web servers do OCSP stapling, so any browser which requires it will just not work. In the past, when browsers want to make changes like this, they have had to give years of warning and then they can only actually make the change once nearly the entire  ecosystem has switched and so you have minimal breakage. This is a huge effort an only worth doing when you have a real problem.As a reference point, it took something like 7 years to disable SHA-1 in browsers [0], and that was an easier problem because (1) CAs were already transitioning (2) it didn't require any change to the servers, unlike OCSP stapling which requires them to regularly fetch OCSP responses [1] and (3) there was a clear security reason to make the change. By contrast, with Firefox's introduction of CRLite, all the major browsers now have some central revocation system, which works today as opposed to years from now and doesn't require any change to the servers.[0] https://security.googleblog.com/2014/09/gradually-sunsetting...\n[1] As an aside it's not clear that OCSP stapling is better than short-lived certs.reply",

It's a hard problem to solve.> As an aside it's not clear that OCSP stapling is better than short-lived certs.I agree this should be the end goal, really.reply",

Mostly companies which have no reason to exist except serving math equations for rent.How many companies now run TLDs? Yeah, .com is centralized, but between ccTLDs, new TLDs, etc., tons. And domain registrars and web hosts which provide DNS services? Thousands. And importantly, hosting companies and DNS providers are trivially easy to change between.The idea Apple or Google can unilaterally decide what the baseline requirements should be needs to be understood as an existential threat to the Internet.And again, every single requirement CAs implement is irrelevant if someone can log into your web host. The entire thing is an emperor has no clothes thing.reply",
      "Incoherent. Browser vendors exert control by dint of controlling the browsers themselves, and are in the picture regardless of the trust system used for TLS. The question is, which is more centralized: the current WebPKI, which you say is also completely dependent on the DNS but involves more companies, or the DNS itself, which is axiomatically fewer companies?I always love when people bring the ccTLDs into these discussions, as if Google could leave .COM when .COM's utterly unaccountable ownership manipulates the DNS to intercept Google Mail.reply"

All large train stations feature some kind of shops, restaurants, etc... just like airports do, however Japan is on another level.

      "My wife and I are complete opposites. One of us processes data instantaneously, connecting it to dozens of other topics at the flip of a switch, and integrating broad knowledge. This makes for a great member of, say, a tiger team.The other thinks slowly, often has no initial opinion, and rarely speaks up, but when they do, the input is flawless and monumental. R&D is their fort\u00e9.Neither one is better than the other. The quick thinker handles in-the-moment action well, but is so wrapped up in the \u201cnow\u201d that it\u2019s difficult for them to get too deep on a topic. The slow thinker meditates on ideas for a while, carefully chooses (almost always the correct) path, and steadies the course. Prick and pull at this one for a quick thought, and it comes out flatter than you could imagine.Until we know what actual intelligence is, trying to act like one form is objectively better than another is just silly.I think lots of the graybeard devs are deep thinkers, not fast thinkers. I think fast thinkers were pulled towards the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d-style companies.reply",
      "Maybe a nonsequitur but in grad school I was in a study group which naturally split into two. In one group (mine) we'd read a problem and immediately charge in, sometimes have to backtrack, and meander around until the answer revealed itself. In the other they would plan everything out, and figure out what they needed to do, and from that the answer would reveal itself and they would write it all down.The interesting part is neither group really finished the problem sets faster than the other. Individual problems my group could, if we knew or guessed the right path immediately, be faster. But over the span of a 10 question p-set it would mostly come out in the wash and both groups would finish in roughly the same amount of time.I often think back on that when reflecting on how I still work that way years later.reply",

      "I also thought about this a lot. Some things about slow thinking are great. I truly believe that it helped me thrive as a software developer.But social interactions are awkward. I can't really come up with things to say easily and lots of times I can't respond in ways to keep the conversation going. Only after the fact I get lots of ideas of what I could have said. I'm truly impressed about others who can just come up with interesting or funny things to say on the spot.I'm a tad older, so I stopped caring about it and just accepted my slow thinking. But I'm sure that I also missed out on a lot of opportunities regarding friendships or work. I still think, that others perceive me as awkward or just not fun and it's hard to just ignore that.Funnily my wife is completely opposite to me and we have the greatest time.reply",

This is also how comedians prep their sets.The key is that things you say are new to the audience, but not to you. It can be the same metaphor you\u2019ve fine-tuned over dozens of interactions.

As someone who tends to be pretty slow to learn how to navigate new social situations, it was eye-opening when I recognized this was something I could do. What's amusing to me at this point is that I'm still not sure he fully realizes that this is something he does sometimes, because he'll still sometimes try to whip out one of the stories when talking to me and then genuinely be surprised when I remind him of some very minor detail about it that he forgot to mention this time he told it.reply",

      "I have been using SVGs for charts on my blog for a couple of months[0] now. Using SVGs satisfied me, but in all honesty, I don't think anyone else cares. For completeness the benefits are below:* The charts are never blurry* The text in the chart is selectable and searchable* The file size could be small compared to PNGs* The charts can use a font set by a stylesheet* The charts can have a builtin dark mode (not demonstrated on my blog)Additionally as the OP shown, the text in SVG is indexed by google, but comes up in the image sections [1].The downside was hours of fiddling with system fonts and webfonts and font settings in matplotlib. Also the sizing of the text in the chart and how it is displayed in your page is tightly coupled and requires some forethought.[0] https://aleyan.com/blog/2025-llm-assistant-census[1] https://www.google.com/search?q=%22slabiciunea+lui+Nicu+fore...reply",

      "Another thing to watch out for with SVGs is how they appear in RSS readers or browser reader views. If you're using external SVG files then it should be fine. If you've optimized them by embedding into the HTML, then you need to be careful. If they rely on CSS rules in the page's CSS then it's not going to work well. For my website I try to make the SVGs self-sufficient by setting the viewBox, width, and height attributes, using a web safe font, and only relying on internal styles. You can still get some measure of light/dark mode support by setting fill or stroke to currentColor.reply",

      "To complete the test, the website needs an HTML page that is mostly SVG. I think that might stand a chance of getting into the main search results rather than just the image search.Also of interest for me would be whether SVG description markup gets picked up in the index.To complete the search of possibilities, having the SVG generated by Javascript on page load would be of interest, for example, with some JSON object of data that then gets parsed to plot some SVG images.Your SVG graphs are very neat and nobody caring is a feature not a bug. If they were blurry PNGs then people might notice but nobody notices 'perfection', just defects.I noticed you were using 'NASA numbers' in your SVGs. Six decimal places for each point on a path is a level of precision that you can cut down with SVGOMG or using the export features from Inkscape. I like to go for integers when possible in SVG.The thing with SVG is that the levels of optimisation go on forever. For example, I would set the viewbox coordinates so that (0, 0) is where the graph starts. Nobody would ever notice or care about that, but it would be something I would have to do.reply",

I just looked at my network panel, and it seems the font files are loaded once per svg on initial load and then are cached.What is the motivation for viewbox coordinates being at (0,0)? I have been thinking about setting chart gutters so that the graph is left aligned with the text, but this seems like an orthogonal issue.reply",

      "Two important notes:1) Semihosting calls are extremely slow. They halt the processor until the debug probe polls the target, notices that it's stopped at a semihosting breakpoint, handles that, and resumes it. This can take tens to hundreds of milliseconds per call.2) You technically need to initialize the semihosting file descriptors with an open() call before using them. Many debuggers will allow you to use the descriptors without initialization, but not all will.reply",
