      "Reposting the comment I made when Fitbit acquired the hollowed-out shell of Pebble, which still applies today:I liked Pebble as a company because they knew how to make just the right engineering compromises to make their product work. The smartwatch everyone wants has a battery that lasts for weeks, a high contrast always-on color screen visible in daylight and total darkness, no bezel, and a round case only a few mm thick. That perfect watch is impossible to build, but Pebble found compromises that worked. They chose different compromises than those of Apple and Google, and IMHO better ones. The Pebble Time Round is a tiny little triumph of smart engineering compared with any other product on the market, including the Apple Watch.In particular it's incredible what the Pebble firmware team was able to accomplish. They built a bespoke OS that's extremely reliable (certainly more reliable than Android Wear), with an app SDK and store, plus a well thought out user interface with a striking visual design and even fun little animated flourishes, despite running in a fraction of the power budget of Apple or Android smartwatches. The Pebble has 256 kilobytes of RAM! How many companies could have done all that in 256 KB?\n \nreply",
      "I bought a watch in 2003 or so and it cost about \u00a3120.I have never worried about powering it - the face is a solar power trickle charger.  I can barely generate enough vitamin D for myself but my watch can power itself from the sun here!My watch's time is accurate to within my perception.  I run a little fleet of stratum 1 NTP devices and I set my watch roughly bi-annually, whether it needs it or not!  The day of week and day of month indicators have gone a big shag.  I think a tooth might have been sheared off but I simply ignore them.My eyes are a bit 50 something on top of short sighted and astigmatism, yet I can still read the time at any time of the day or night.I get that I can't read my email on it, nor can it take my pulse but I'm not too sure I'm missing anything.\n \nreply",

What is the Pebble Watch's value proposition in 2025?\n \nreply",
      "I gave up trying new smartwatches after three or four bad ones. I haven't tried the recent Garmins. But looking at the current products, they look like giant bricks compared to the PTR, which I believe still wears the crown of thinnest smartwatch ever made (and not by a little bit either).

      "Awesome! The first Pebble absolutely fascinated me by having a hackable, C-running watch on my wrist.I vividly remember spending days fine tuning the heuristics of a simple step detection algorithm in the first watchface where I thought \u201cseeing your daily step count next to time sure is awesome\u201d. And later, tens of thousands of people thought so as well - this was one of the signs what the health-tracking wrist device is about to become.It was incredible that even the first model allowed you to run a 30 samples per second accelerometer sampling and classifying the movement, 24/7, and still lasted days. No other watch offers a similar level of hackability.And as the time progressed, Pebble became the first platform to get Weathergraph - my graphical weather watchface.Weathergraph was then ported to Garmin (as Pebble shut down), and then to Apple Watch widget (as it became a capable platform with the introduction of standalone watch-apps in watchOS 6), and then to iOS app & widget, where it now lets me live a life of indie developer, after a serie of corporate design/PM/dev jobs.Thank you for that, Eric & Pebble team.I still keep the developer edition Pebble with my name printed on the back (great touch!) in my shelf and heart, and will always remember Jon Barlow, one of the best and most helpful developer advocates I ever encountered.And kudos to the whole dev team. The watch and companion app was rock stable, always staying connected, the calendar always being in sync, watch apps installed quickly and reliably - the things that 10x larger companies struggled with for years were nailed here almost from day one.Godspeed!PS: What a mishap to shut the company down shortly after a release of Pebble 2. It nailed the experience of a lightweight watch, with the most contrasty BW reflective screen I have seen, and buttery smooth animations (while Garmin still renders menus in like 8-10 fps on their MIP screens 10 years later). So small and lightweight, I\u2019d love everyone to try it on, and compare with 2024 smartwatches.\n \nreply",
      "I love the animation when you click \"No\" on \"Do you want a new Pebble?\". So extra.\n \nreply",
      "Gotta be honest I feel like Garmin is the perfect balance of pebble vs apple watch\n \nreply",
      "My Pebble Time Steel finally bit the dust so I turned to a Garmin Instinct. I can't stand it. The button placement is totally random and legitimately painful to use. The Garmin software focuses on fitness activities to the exclusion of everything else.I recoil at having been tempted by the more expensive Garmin watches.

      "People passing cynical comments at Google need to understand that at a big co like Google, something like this doesn't 'just happen'. It probably happened because some passionate L6/L7 engineer wanted to do it and pushed through the bureaucracy to get approvals for it, probably largely on their own time (by which I mean that this was at best a side-project for them and at worst a distraction that was losing them favor with their bosses). At every point in the process, they probably had to justify what they were doing to their leads, to lawyers, to privacy reviewers, who had no real stake in it and so had nothing to lose by saying No. They almost certainly won't receive any career progress out of this and would risk a setback if something slips through the cracks (such as some unredacted proprietary information).They did it because they felt it was the right thing to do.

      "With some filtering on the output to knock down harmonics and aliasing noise, and as long as the power output is low enough, this could actually be legal in the US. IANAL, etc, but this is my understanding:It's actually ridiculously tricky to measure transmitter power output in the terms that the FCC regs are written in, but the rule of thumb is that, given the receiver sensitivity of a typical radio, if you lose the signal when you're more than 200 feet from the transmitter, you're probably in the clear.This means a perfectly legal power level would be more than adequate to cover your house, office, hackerspace, or whatever.https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/low-power-radio-general-info...\n \nreply",
      "If by \"ridiculously tricky\" you mean \"requires specialized equipment and domain knowledge\".  Like say, skiing.With a cheapish Rigol spectrum analyzer and homebrew receive antennas and DIY wooden/pvc tripods you could probably do 3m open-air measurements to within 3dB of what you would measure in an anechoic chamber at a test laboratory if you were very careful.  I can 100% assure you that is possible with a commercial dipole kit and horn antenna, neither of which is that expensive if you're getting paid.  This in in the FM band so you could use dipoles and a low-end analyzer to the tenth harmonic.\n \nreply",
      "You can absolutely hook an antenna to a spec-an, but how do you calibrate the result? I can get a power measurement of mV or dBm at the instrument input, but that's not how the regs are written.They're written as field strength in free space (microvolts per meter), which as I understand it, either requires a calibrated field probe, or a calibrated antenna. I'm sure there's a way to perform such calibrations from first principles, but that's where I'm invoking \"tricky\". If you've got a trick to it, please share.In practice, Part 15.23 is pretty generous about home-built equipment, and I think since the \"200 foot\" thing came from the FCC's own mouth, if you can show that you walked the perimeter with a portable radio and confirmed that you're good, that probably shows good faith on the power issue....Absolutely yes a spectrum analyzer is helpful to make sure your harmonic filtering is working. I would put that forth as \"good engineering practice\" under 15.5, and it's far more than any hobbyist could be reasonably expected to do even just a few years ago; this equipment has gotten mindbogglingly affordable and accessible.\n \nreply",

IANAL, but I do hang out with a lot of hammies. You can't help but absorb a lot of technical stuff with them around.Like for example, https://www.fcc.gov/enforcement/areas/jammersIt need not saturate the bands, you technically are in violation the moment a non-licensed entity has caused interference to a licensed entity.Willful is a pretty low bar since general intent can be derived from any related negligent acts. Its pretty safe to say transmitting on these bands without a license is illegal, and yes its a fairly big deal.Most of the public radio spectrum has been monitored, and archived for later retrieval if circumstances dictate since the 60s. There are services that aggregate this data and make realtime info available globally from satellite systems. Trilateration of signals is fairly trivial in most cases.You may not get caught if you always stay below the noise floor, but you can't really have any real use of the spectrum in doing so, and algorithmic scanning of structured signals is always improving.It is really negligent to make it seem like these things are legal, when they aren't, and the author should get in trouble for that.A simple disclaimer isn't going to cut it when then primary purpose is effectively breaking the law in many civilized nations.\n \nreply"

But for some reason I figured this would be funnier.What do I mean by flooding the FM broadcast band? Well, in Canada and the US (and maybe other places too), the FM broadcast band spans 88 MHz - 108 MHz. You can't broadcast wherever, though. Stations will only appear on odd-numbered frequencies, like 88.1 MHz, 94.5 MHz, 107.3 MHz, etc. There's a technical reason for this - every FM broadcast takes up about 150 KHz of bandwidth, and spacing the broadcasts like this allows for an extra 50 KHz of wiggle room.This also works out to 100 different frequencies that we need to populate (with 100 dif"

      "I always think it's a shame that these features end up getting built into ecosystem-specific build tools. Why do we need separate build systems for every language? It seems entirely possible to have build system that can do all this stuff for every language at once.From my experience at Google I _know_ this is possible in a Megamonorepo. I have briefly fiddled with Bazel and it seems there's quite a barrier to entry, I dunno if that's just lack of experience but it didn't quite seem ready for small projects.Maybe Nix is the solution but that has barrier to entry more at the human level - it just seems like a Way of Life that you have to dive all the way into.Nonetheless, maybe I should try diving into one or both of those tools at some point.\n \nreply",
      "I think the problem is basically because the build system has to be implemented using some ecosystem, and no other ecosystem wants to depend on that one.If your \"one build system to rule them all\" was built in, say, Ruby, the Python ecosystem won't want to use it. No Python evangelist wants to tell users that step 1 of getting up and running with Python is \"Install Ruby\".So you tend to get a lot of wheel reinvention across ecosystems.I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. Yes, it's a lot of redundant work. But it's also an opportunity to shed historical baggage and learn from previous mistakes. Compare, for example, how beloved Rust's cargo ecosystem is compared the ongoing mess that is package management in Python.A fresh start can be valuable, and not having a monoculture can be helpful for rapid evolution.\n \nreply",
      "> Why do we need separate build systems for every language?Because being cross-language makes them inherit all of the complexity of the worst languages they support.The infinite flexibility required to accommodate everyone keeps costing you at every step.You need to learn a tool that is more powerful than your language requires, and pay the cost of more abstraction layers than you need.Then you have to work with snowflake projects that are all different in arbitrary ways, and more complex than necessary, just because they could, and the everything-agnostic tool didn't impose any conventions or constraints.The vague do-it-all build systems make everything more complicated than necessary. Their \"simple\" components are either a mere execution primitive that make handling different platforms/versions/configurations your problem, or are macros/magic/plugins that are a fractal of a build system written inside a build system, with more custom complexity underneath.OTOH a language-specific build system knows exactly what that language needs, and doesn't need to support more. It can include specific solutions and workarounds for its target environments, out of the box, because it knows what it's building and what platforms it supports. It can use conventions and defaults of its language to do most things without configuration, instead of using a build script that needs to exist (that sucks already), needs to be written, understood, debugged, and gets tweaked endlessly.A single-language build tool can support just one standard project structure and have all projects and dependencies follow it. That makes it easier to work on other projects, and easier to write tooling that works with all of them. All because focused build system doesn't accommodate all the custom legacy projects of all languages.You don't realize how much of a skill-and-effort black hole build scripts are is until you use a language where a build command just builds it.\n \nreply",
      "(I worked on source control at FB for many years.)The main argument for not overly genericizing things is that you can deliver a better user experience through domain-specific code.For Bazel and buck2 specifically, they require a total commitment to it, which implies ongoing maintenance work. I also think the fact that they don't have open governance is a hindrance. Google's and Meta's internal monorepos make certain tradeoffs that don't quite work in a more distributed model.Bazel is also in Java I believe, which is a bit unfortunate due to process startup times. On my machine, `time bazelisk --help` takes over 0.75 seconds to run, compared to `time go --help` which is 0.003 seconds and `time cargo --help` which is 0.02 seconds.

From a greenfield perspective a lot of work to try and catch up to Bazel's cross-language support and community. I think we can eventually get there, but it will be a long slog\n \nreply",
      "I've had exactly the same thought, after hitting walls repeatedly with limitations in single-language ecosystems. And likewise, I've had the same concerns around the complexity that comes with Bazel/Buck/Nix.It's been such a frustration for me that I started writing my own as a side project a year or two ago, based on a using a standardized filesystem structure for packages instead of a manifest or configuration language. By leaning into the filesystem heavily, you can avoid a lot of language lock-in and complexity that comes with other tools. And with fingerprint-based addressing for packages and files, it's quite fast. Incremental rebuild checks for my projects with hundreds of packages take only 200-300ms on my low-end laptop with an Intel N200 and mid-tier SSD.It's an early stage project and the documentation needs some work, but if you're interested:\nhttps://github.com/somesocks/dryad\nhttps://somesocks.github.io/dryad/One other alternative I know of that's multi-language is Pants(https://www.pantsbuild.org/), which has support for packages in several languages, and an \"ad-hoc\" mode which lets you build packages with a custom tool if it isn't officially supported.

Major issues show up with Bazel once you start having to write rules, tool chains, or if your workspace file talks to the Internet.I think you can fix these issues by using a package manager around Bazel. Conda is my preferred choice because it is in the top tier for adoption, cross platform support, and supported more locked down use cases like going through mirrors, not having root, not controlling file paths, etc. What Bazel gets from this is a generic solution for package management with better version solving for build rules, source dependencies and binary dependencies. By sourcing binary deps from conda forge, you get a midpoint between deep investment into Bazel and binaries with unknown provenance which allows you to incrementally move to source as appropriate.Additional notes: some requirements limit utility and approach being partial support of a platform. If you require root on Linux, wsl on Windows, have frequent compilation breakage on darwin, or neglect Windows file paths, your cross platform support is partial in my book.Use of Java for Bazel and Python for conda might be regrettable, but not bad enough to warrant moving down the list of adoption and in my experience there is vastly more Bazel out there than Buck or other competitors. Similarly, you want to see some adoption from Haskell, Rust, Julia, Golang, Python, C++, etc.JavaScript is thorny. You really don't want to have to deal with multiple versions of the same library with compiled languages, but you have to with JavaScript. I haven't seen too much demand for JavaScript bindings to C++ wrappers around a Rust core that uses C core libraries, but I do see that for Python bindings.\n \nreply",
      "> You really don't want to have to deal with multiple versions of the same library with compiled languages, but you have to with JavaScript.Rust handles this fine by unifying up to semver compatibility -- diamond dependency hell is an artifact of the lack of namespacing in many older languages.\n \nreply"

      "This interview with DeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng, also co-founder of the hedge fund backing DeepSeek, might shed some light on the question: https://www.chinatalk.media/p/deepseek-ceo-interview-with-ch...Some relevant excerpts:\u201cBecause we believe the most important thing now is to participate in the global innovation wave. For many years, Chinese companies are used to others doing technological innovation, while we focused on application monetization \u2014 but this isn\u2019t inevitable. In this wave, our starting point is not to take advantage of the opportunity to make a quick profit, but rather to reach the technical frontier and drive the development of the entire ecosystem.\u201d\u201cWe believe that as the economy develops, China should gradually become a contributor instead of freeriding. In the past 30+ years of the IT wave, we basically didn\u2019t participate in real technological innovation. We\u2019re used to Moore\u2019s Law falling out of the sky, lying at home waiting 18 months for better hardware and software to emerge. That\u2019s how the Scaling Law is being treated.\u201cBut in fact, this is something that has been created through the tireless efforts of generations of Western-led tech communities. It\u2019s just because we weren\u2019t previously involved in this process that we\u2019ve ignored its existence.\u201d\u201cWe do not have financing plans in the short term. Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.\u201d\u201cIn the face of disruptive technologies, moats created by closed source are temporary. Even OpenAI\u2019s closed source approach can\u2019t prevent others from catching up. So we anchor our value in our team \u2014 our colleagues grow through this process, accumulate know-how, and form an organization and culture capable of innovation. That\u2019s our moat.\u201cOpen source, publishing papers, in fact, do not cost us anything. For technical talent, having others follow your innovation gives a great sense of accomplishment. In fact, open source is more of a cultural behavior than a commercial one, and contributing to it earns us respect. There is also a cultural attraction for a company to do this.\u201d\n \nreply",

      "There's a fascinating story about ego in science buried here.William Henry Preece was Engineer-In-Chief at the British Post Office in the late 19th Century (basically heading their telegraphy efforts) and controversially stuck to Thomson's model, or the \"KR Law\" as it was called back then, relying on poor quality experimental results to direct the organization.Oliver Heaviside publicly criticized Preece, who in turn blocked publication of Heaviside's writing to preserve his own reputation (according to Wikipedia). When Preece retired in 1899 and received a knighthood, Heaviside wrote in the preface of Volume II of \"Electromagnetic Theory\":\"It is to be hoped and expected that the late important removals in the British Telegraph Department will lead to much improvement in the quality of official science.\"Writing by hand on his own copy, Heaviside suggested that the preface (and thus the book's publication) were \"held back\" so as to \"allow W H Preece to make sure of his knighthood\".https://outsideecho.com/DGT-BIO_files/PDFs/DGT13.pdfSo! On the one hand, we have an esteemed engineer who ran the country's telegraphs and refused to admit he made a mistake, became a knight and faded somewhat from history; on the other hand, we have a self-taught physicist who made massive contributions to our understanding and analysis of electromagnetism, lived in \"relative poverty\" for fifty years while doing so, didn't shy away from calling out bad science, and he gets the analogue of heaven named after him in the musical \"CATS\".\n \nreply",

So it just guesses and adjusts, which you don't want as it gives you exactly the ringing etc Heaviside identified. The video is a nice complement, as it perfectly visualizes the issues at play.It's a pretty wild bit of understanding to have, even in simple situations like flipping on a light switch.\n \nreply",
      "That is a great visualisation, yes!It's probably more helpful to not use the idea of 'guessing' though - the transition from off to on is a signal with a certain frequency content and that signal is reacting to the capacitance and inductance etc. of the wires and propagating through them basically the only way it can. Once the signal has propagated through and the ringing has all been absorbed it settles on the DC condition.\n \nreply",
      "That video is good for the water like wave explanation that is a very useful lens.  If you want a more in-depth explanation, particularly how the field is in the dielectric and the wires/traces are simply the wave guide, this long presentation by Rick Hartley will help move to the next level.https://www.youtube.com/live/ySuUZEjARPYThe dramatic shift in behavior above the audio frequency range is where the water wave lens starts to fall down IMHO.I was looking at my brothers memory card from a Cray 1a the other day and that video popped in my head. They had the timing traces snaking through several flat-pack chips legs.  No wonder they had to move from parity to Hamming code even with exclusively using differential twisted pairs between modules.\n \nreply",
      "That one\u2018s gold too, but for me it was the other way round - needed Hartley to fully grasp Alpha Phoenix.Understanding waves feels a bit like the bell curve meme for me: you start with the mental water model, and eventually end up with it again.Or Feynman: you hear him helpfully talk about bouncy rubber balls, then learn a bunch of stuff over the next decade, and randomly listen to the same lecture again, and suddenly all sorts of \u201eaaaah, that\u2019s what he meant\u201c lightbulbs go off.\n \nreply",
      "I should also clarify something above, Oliver Heaviside did discover the energy flows through the dielectric, most explanations like that video use other lenses to communicate the very real need to consider voltage and current.The original link side stepped that as to be honest it is to complicated for the intended use case.All models are wrong, some are useful, and the water wave model is very useful for very real needs.I personally wasted a lot of time confusing the map for the territory, but yes everyones path will be different. I confused the \"electron flow\" and water wave model as being absolute ground truth for way longer than I would like to admit.\n \nreply",

Although hampered by the loss of his two legs, Bader was a remarkable pilot and, once captured by the German, a persistent escapee.The start of the Second World War spelt opportunity for Douglas Bader, who had been medically discharged from the RAF following a plane crash in late 1931.Bader lost both legs when his Bristol Bulldog crashed and, despite demonstrating his ability to continue flying and his competency on prosthetics, he was medically discharged against his will.Having successfully petitioned the RAF to return to service and passed his re-training, Bader was assigned to No. 12 Group and flew with No. 222 Squadron at RAF Duxford. He fought over Dunkirk in the Battle "

      "I wouldn't be so quick to attribute the embellished biographies to AI.  That's certainly a possibility, but it's also just as possible that these are humans going off of verbal/oral histories that morphed in the ongoing game of Telephone.  Plenty of humans get things mixed up, after all.Still, it's worth being vigilant about this sort of thing, AI or no - and LLMs are certainly increasing in the quality and quantity of bullshit they can produce.  People give Wikipedia a lot of flack for being \"editable by everyone\", but the emphasis on providing actual citations for claims is an important one - to the point that I'll readily trust an \"amateur\"/\"hobbyist\" work that cites its sources over a \"professional\" work that doesn't.\n \nreply",
      "I'm not very anti-LLM/AI, but this is one of the scarier parts, to me at least.Data that is obscure, not easily fact-checked, and (outside of a \nhandful of people) there's no motivation to fact check it.Incorrect data will sit there, mostly viewed by other bots,\nincorporated into the next model. The issue is just going to snowball.Good luck to any future historians that want to look back at\nthis time period.\n \nreply",
      "Such consequences might be undesired, but hardly unanticipated or surprising. Not to the smart folks who came up with LLMs.(A lot of what we're having around us now has been anticipated by sci-fi, but earlier  sci-fi largely failed to predict the internet, so we have fewer predictions about such stuff. Lem's \"Futurological Congress\" could be seen as a weird anticipation of a deeply faked world.)\n \nreply",

      "That\u2019s a fun writeup.I\u2019ve come to a similar conclusion - for now at least it\u2019s best applied at a fairly granular level. Make me a red brick wall there rather than \u201ehey architect make me a house\u201c.I do think OP tried a bit too much new stuff in one go though. USB plus zig is quite a bit more ambitious than the traditional hello world in a new lang\n \nreply",
      "Counterexample: Ive been able to complete more side projects in the last month leveraging llms than i have ever in my life. One of which I believe to have potential as a viable product, and another which involved complicated rust `no_std` and linker setup  for compiling rust code onto bare metal RISCV from scratch.I think the key to being successful here is to realize that you're still at the wheel as an engineer. The llm is there to rapidly synthesize the universe of information.You still need to 1) have solid fundamentals in order to  have an intuition against that synthesis, and 2) be experienced enough to translate that synthesis into actionable outcomes.If youre lacking in either, youre at the same whims of copypasta that have always existed.\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019ve found LLMs to basically be a more fluent but also more lossy way of interfacing with stack overflow and tutorials.If a topic is well represented in those places, then you will get your answer quicker and it can be to some extent shaped to your use case.If the topic is not well represented there, then you will get circular nonsense.You can say \u201cobviously, that\u2019s the training data\u201d, and that\u2019s true, and I do find it obvious personally, but the reaction to LLMs as some kind of second coming does not align with this reality.\n \nreply",
      "I find that LLMs are almost comically bad at projects that have a hardware component like RaspberryPi or Pico, or Ardunio.I think that its because often the libraries you use are niche or have a a few similar versions, the LLM really commonly hallucinated solutions and would continually suggest that library X did have that capability. I think because often in hardware projects you often hit a point where you can't do something or you need to modify a library, but the LLM tries to be \"helpful\" and it makes up a solution.\n \nreply",
      "I find LLMs to be decent unblockers. I only turn to them form time to time though, unless Im in a playful mode and try poking out various ideas. As a coder I also ask for snippets when Im lazy. I tried growing a slightly larger solution a few times and it failed in dumb ways. It was clear it doesn\u2019t really comprehend we do, it\u2019s not aware it\u2019s moving in circles and so on. All these things will probably see a lot incremental of improvents and as a tool will definitely stay but fundamentally LLMs can\u2019t really think, at least the way we do and expecting that is also foolish.\n \nreply",
      "Claude is like having my own college professor. I've learned more in the past month with Claude then I learned in the past year. I can ask questions repeatedly and get clarification as fine as a need it. Granted, Claude has limits, but its a game-changer.> I think the key to being successful here is to realize that you're still at the wheel as an engineer. The llm is there to rapidly synthesize the universe of information.Bingo. OP is like someone who is complaining about the tools, when they should be working on their talent. I have a LOT of hobbies (circuits, woodworking, surfing, playing live music, cycling, photography) and there will always be people who buy the best gear and complain that the gear sucks. (NOTE: I\"m not implying claude is \"the best gear\", but it's a big big help.)I think the only problem with LLMs is synthesis of new knowledge is severely limited. They are great at explaining things others have explained, but suck hard at inventing new things. At least that's my experience with Claude: it's terrible as a \"greenfield\" dev.\n \nreply",
      "I would add though, that they can be very good at combining known concepts. Which can create a non-trivial set of \"new knowledge\".\n \nreply",
