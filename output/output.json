It's particularly easy to start using if you're already familiar with the jq.If you use things like `array_to_json(array_agg(row_to_json(....)))` in your psql commands to output some rows to JSON, then sq's `--json` or `--jsonl` is quite a bit easier IMHO.

It's free and has an absolutely fantastic collection of ancient and sacred manuscripts. I was lucky enough to live across the street from it for several years and it remains one of my favourite museums in the world.\n \nreply",
      "Chester Beatty is a gem. I went into it not expecting much from \"museum of books\". But it's also in a way a museum of world's religions, which are tightly connected to writing and books. As an atheist who has low opinion on value of religion because of all the deaths they were and still are responsible for, it reminded me of their positive role in history. When you see all those ancient religious books you begin to question whether we would have writing at all without them? Who would go through a painstaking process of duplicating books before Gutenberg if not men devoting their lives to God? Thus carrying light of civilization and creating basis and tools for science to progress later. I know this is not some great revelation, but I felt enlightened a bit after leaving Chester Beatty.\n \nreply",

      "There arent any alternatives for major catastrophes that can top amplitude modulated radio.if you are in a car fleeing for your life from a wildfire, major storm, or war, AM radio is available sometimes hundreds of miles from your location to provide timely instruction and lifesaving updates. if you need electricity for a radio, your car has fuel and can provide a radio signal to you for quite some time.AM radio can be transmitted with a roll of wire and a relatively simple transciever from an FOB or refugee camp. digital radio requires codecs, licenses, and specialty equipment. Satellite radio may, or may not be available as the ground stations that power it require even more advanced transcievers and software to operate and could take months to repair if attacked or destroyed. Cellular towers require special beamforming antenna that can take months to rebuild or procure in an emergency and rely on an advanced system of transcievers and software to provide a signal.its not Dolby quality, but if you need clean water and shelter it will guide you. Arguably you could mandate a VHF receiver in every car for FM based NOAA/EAS alerts, but AM is still cheaper.\n \nreply",
      "While that\u2019s all true, why is being in a car a special case? If I\u2019m at home without power, I can\u2019t access online information sources any more than I could if I were driving somewhere without cell data coverage. Should building codes require my house to have a radio installed? No one is legislating that tents have built in radios, but if I\u2019m camping I\u2019m in even more need of emergency information than if I\u2019m already in a car and driving. Someone might rightfully tell me that it\u2019s my responsibility to take a radio with me while I\u2019m camping. Why does Toyota have to provide me with a radio while driving?I ham a ham extra license. I like radio and see its value.

Moreso because they already have the engineering expertise for doing so.It also forces at least one AM radio into the hands of >90% American households, and since for most disasters there's some kind of an evacuation you'll likely be in your car rather than your home.Could we draw a line in the sand somewhere else (e.g., building codes)? Sure. It'll be a higher cost solution that grandfathers in most homes as not having an AM radio though. Could we mandate disaster bags? It'll probably devolve into a cottage industry of the cheapest thing that's maybe legal with low compliance of households even buying something to that standard, but sure, we can do that too. A \"greedy\" (as in greedy algorithms) utilitarian perspective might be valuable here though. Instead of bikeshedding, does this bill help make people safer at an appropriate cost? If so, pointing to other lines in the sand is reasonable insofar as we want to make the law better, but not to refute the law in the first place. If not, we ought to be able to point to those reasons instead of other lines in the sand.\n \nreply",

I had failed to grok the part of the article where LoRa is now supported by the sx128x (as opposed to the sx126x) on 2.4GHz.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383692369_WiLo_Long...> In this article, we introduce a new algorithmic framework called WiLo, designed to enable directional communication from Wi-Fi to LoRa, which employs signal emulation techniques to enable off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware to produce a valid 2.4 GHz LoRa waveform.So, critically, and as far as I can tell this isn't in the summary article, this is purely unidirectional; and so, this isn't about being able to build a network that upgrades the range of WiFi with some tradeoffs: this is about being able to send data from existing WiFi hardware to existing LoRa hardware using a relatively minimal set of changes (though I still don't appreciate how this would practically be done to the existing hardware, and they apparently only simulated this with software-defined radio).> The core innovation of WiLo lies in the signal emulation technique used to generate a valid 2.4 GHz LoRa waveform. Through sophisticated signal processing algorithms, WiLo transforms the standard Wi-Fi signals into LoRa-like wave-forms, while ensuring compliance with the LoRa modulation specifications. This enables the LoRa hardware to decode WiFi signals without requiring any modifications to the hardware itself. The emulation of LoRa waveforms is achieved by carefully manipulating the parameters of the Wi-Fi signals, such as the modulation index, spreading factor, and BW, to closely match the characteristics of LoRa modulation.> We would like to emphasize that WiLo is directly supported among commodity devices, and the USRP-B210 devices are used only for evaluation purposes to measure low-level PHY information, which is inaccessible by commodity devices. For example, a commodity Wi-Fi card such as the Atheros AR2425 can replace USRP-B210 devices as the sender.\n \nreply",

      "We just recently discovered, that during childbrith, vaginal microbiota is transferred to the child and this transfer is quite beneficial for the development of the immune system of the child. It's called vaginal microbiota transfer (VMT). It's so beneficial that babies being born via c-section are now artificially covered in their mother's vaginal microbiota.Now imagine the thousands of factors that happen during pregnancy that probably influence the neurodevelopment of a human and which artifical womb doesn't take into account. Simple things such as: hearing and feeling the heartbeat of the mother, feeling the environment, heat, cold, being carried through life and so on.\n \nreply",

But other ant species cooperate with fungi\u2014in some cases strains of fungus that are also found growing in their environment.Genetic studies have shown that these symbiotic relationships are highly specific\u2014a given ant species will often cooperate with just a single strain of fungus.
