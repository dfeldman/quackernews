      "Well I started with pip because it's what I was told to use. But it was slow and had footguns. And then I started using virtualenv, but that only solved part of the problem. So I switched to conda, which sometimes worked but wrecked my shell profile and often leads to things mysteriously using the wrong version of a package. So someone told me to use pipenv, which was great until it was abandoned and picked up by someone who routinely broke the latest published version. So someone told me to use poetry, but it became unusably slow. So I switched back to pip with the built-in venv, but now I have the and problems I had before, with fewer features. So I switched to uv, because it actually worked.

      "How?reply",
      "CNAMEs. I do this for everything. Example:1. Your main domain is important.example.com with provider A. No DNS API token for security.2. Your throwaway domain in a dedicated account with DNS API is example.net with provider B and a DNS API token in your ACME client3. You create\n_acme-challenge.important.example.com not as TXT via API but permanent as CNAME to\n_acme-challenge.example.net or\n_acme-challenge.important.example.com.example.net4. Your ACME client writes the challenge responses for important.example.com into a TXT at the unimportant _acme-challenge.example.net and has only API access to provider B. If this gets hacked and example.net lost you change the CNAMES and use a new domain whatever.tld as CNAME target.acme.sh supports this (see https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/DNS-alias-mo... this also works for wildcards as described there), most ACME clients do.I also wrote an acme.sh Ansible role supporting this: https://github.com/foundata/ansible-collection-acmesh/tree/m....

All of my acme.sh instances talk to it to publish TXT records, and accepts queries from the internet for those TXT records.There's a NS record so *.acme-dns.example.com delegates requests to it, so each of my hosts that need a cert have a public CNAME like _acme-challenge.www.example.com CNAME asdfasf.acme-dns.example.com which points back to the acme-dns server.When setting up a new hostname/certificate, a REST request is sent to acme-dns to register a new username/password/subdomain which is fed to acme.sh. Then every time acme.sh needs to issue/renew the certificate it sends the TXT info to the internal acme-dns server, which in turn makes it available to the world.reply",
      "Usually you just CNAME it.You can cname _acme-challenge.foo.com to foo.bar.com.Now, if when you do the DNS challenge, you make a TXT at foo.bar.com with the challenge response, through CNAME redirection, the TXT record is picked up as if it were directly at _acme-challenge.foo.com. You can now issue wildcard certs for anything for foo.com.I have it on my backlog to build an automated solution to this later this year to handle this for hundreds of individual domains and then put the resulting certificates in AWS secrets manager.I'm going to also see if I can make some sort of ACME proxy, so internal clients authenticate to me, but they cant control dns, so I make the requests on their behalf.

Some of the most skilled low level optimization people I know work on cryptography.

In all the recent new crypto standards, a big decision in the whittling down of the finalists was performance.If someone is telling you that we need a new, faster standard for cryptography, and the selling point is \u201cfaster,\u201d you\u2019d better wonder why that wasn\u2019t the standard already in use.

      "I saw a talk by someone from Google about their experiences using Rust in the Android team. Two points stuck out: they migrated many projects from Python, so performance can't have been that much of a concern, and in their surveys the features people liked most were basics like pattern matching and ADTs. My conclusion is that for a lot of tasks the benefit from Rust came from ML cicra 1990, not lifetimes etc. I feel if OCaml had got its act together around about 2010 with multicore and a few other annoyances[1] it could have been Rust. Unfortunately it fell into the gap between what academia could justify working on and what industry was willing to do.[1]: Practically speaking, the 31-bit Ints are annoying if you're trying to do any bit bashing, but aesthetically the double semicolons are an abomination and irk me far more.reply",
      "I'd say that Google strives to have a reasonably short list of languages approved for production-touching code. Rust can replace / complement C++, while OCaml cannot (it could replace Go instead... fat chance!). So I suspect that the team picked Rust because it was the only blessed language with ADTs, not because they won't like something with faster compile times.No way OCaml could have stolen the Rust's thunder: we have a number of very decent and performant GC-based languages, from Go to Haskell; we only had one bare-metal-worthy expressive language in 2010, C++, and it was pretty terrible (still is, but before C++11 and C++17 it was even more terrible).reply",

I know the biggest recipient of Rust trainings was the Android platform team at first, which I think also used a lot of C++.Kotlin is definitely available at Google, but when talking about sym types et al it's not nearly as nice to use as Rust / OCaml.reply",
      "Yes. It can also be compiled to native. I just think it was held back too much by the java/jvm backwards compatibility but then again that's probably also the justification for its existence.I definitely find it (and jetpack compose) make developing android apps a much better experience than it used to be.What I like a lot about Kotlin are its well written documentation and the trailing lambdas feature. That is definitely directly OCaml inspired (though I also recently saw it in a newer language, the \"use\" feature in Gleam). But in Kotlin it looks nicer imo. Allows declarative code to look pretty much like json which makes it more beginner friendly than the use syntax.But Kotlin doesn't really significantly stand out among Java, C#, Swift, Go, etc. And so it is kind of doomed to be a somewhat domain specific language imo.reply",

You are probably familiar with English.  There are rather a lot more languages here.  Irish, Scottish, Welsh - these are the thriving Brythonic languages (and they probably have some sub-types).  Cornish formally died out in the sixties (the last two sisters that spoke it natively, passed away) but it has been revived by some locals and given that living people who could communicate with relos with first hand experience, I think we can count that a language that is largely saved.

Permitted use of artificial intelligence.(a) As used in this Section, \"permitted use of artificial intelligence\" means the use of artificial intelligence tools or systems by a licensed professional to assist in providing administrative support or supplementary support in therapy or psychotherapy services where the licensed professional maintains full responsibility for all interactions, outputs, and data use associated with the system and satisfies the requirements of subsection (b).(b) No licensed professional shall be permitted to use artificial intelligence to assist in providing supplementary support in therapy or psychotherapy where the client's therapeutic session is recorded or transcribed unless:(1) the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative is informed in writing of the following:(A) that artificial intelligence will be used; and(B) the specific purpose of the artificial intelligence tool or system that will be used; and(2) the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative provides consent to the use of artificial intelligence.Source: Illinois HB1806https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus/FullText?GAID=18...reply",

      "This is a legitimate problem in datacenters. They're getting to the point where a single 40(ish)OU/RU rack can pull a megawatt in some hyperdense cases. The talk of GPU/AI datacenters consuming inordinate amounts of energy isn't just because the DC's are yuge, (although some are), but because the power draw per rack unit space is going through the roof as well.On the consumer side of things where the CPU's are branded Ryzen or Core instead of Epyc or Xeon, a significant chunk of that power consumption is from the boosting behavior they implement to pseudo-artificially[0] inflate their performance numbers. You can save huge (easily 10%, often closer to 30%, but really depends on exact build/generation) on energy by doing a very mild undervolt and limiting boosting behavior on these cpus. Intel 11th through 14th gen CPU's are especially guilty of this, as are most Threadripper CPU's. you can often trade single digit or even negligible performance losses (depends on what you're using it for and how much you undervolt/underclock/restrict boosting) for double digit reductions in power usage. This phenomenon is also true for GPU's when compared across the enterprise/consumer divide, but not quite to the significant extent in most cases.Point being, yeah, it's a problem in datacenters, but honestly there's a lot of headroom still even if you only have your common american 15A@120VAC outlets available before you need to call your electrician and upgrade your panel and/or install 240VAC outlets or what have you.0: I say pseudo-artificial because the performance advantages are real, but unless you're doing some intensive/extreme cooling, aren't sustainable or indicative of nominal performance, just a brief bit of extra headroom before your cooling solution heatsoaks and the CPU/GPU's throttle themselves back down.

So why are artists obsessed with pen plotters?I'll be upfront, I'm going to list all of the reasons that I love pen plotters in this article. That's not to say that they're superior, though. Like any tool, they have their place amongst many different printing technologies and come with their own benefits and drawbacks.Pen plotters are somewhat like 3D printers. They move in X/Y space and typically have a pen lift mechanism.

Coding has becoming a very prevalent hobby now, and access to hobbyist boards like Arduinos and Raspberry Pis has become much more democratized.reply"

      "The study is based on having LLMs decide to amplify one of the top ten posts on their timeline or share a news headline. LLMs aren\u2019t people, and the authors have not convinced me that they will behave like people in this context.The behavioral options are restricted to posting news headlines, reposting news headlines, or being passive. There\u2019s no option to create original content, and no interventions centered on discouraging reposting. Facebook has experimented[0] with limits to reposting and found such limits discouraged the spread of divisive content and misinformation.I mostly use social media to share pictures of birds[1]. This contributes to some of the problems the source article[2] discusses. It causes fragmentation; people who don\u2019t like bird photos won\u2019t follow me. It leads to disparity of influence; I think I have more followers than the average Mastodon account. I sometimes even amplify conflict[3].[0] https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/internal-research-from...[1] https://social.goodanser.com/@zaktakespictures/[2] https://arxiv.org/html/2508.03385v1#S3[3] https://social.goodanser.com/@zaktakespictures/1139481946021...reply",
      "Social media as a vessel for diverse discussion is a tall order. It\u2019s too public, too tied to context, and ultimately a no-win game. No matter how carefully you present yourself, you\u2019ll end up being the \u201cbad guy\u201d to someone. The moment a discussion touches even lightly on controversy, healthy dialogue becomes nearly impossible.Think of it this way: you\u2019re hosting a party, and an uninvited stranger kicks the door open, then starts criticizing how you make your bed. That\u2019s about what it feels like to try to \u201cfix\u201d social media.reply",
      "Whitelisting solves the problem for me. I curate every tweet I see with a browser extension. Strangers can't kick down the door. I only see content from my direct follows. It dramatically reduces the stress. Maybe a little like horse blinkers.reply",
      "I still think old school linear forums are the best format for online discussion.  They\u2019re not perfect by any means, but I think they still beat all the alternatives I\u2019ve tried.reply",
      "The old school forums also centered around a single topic or interest, which I think helped keep things focused and more civil. Part of the problem with social media is that it wants to be everything for everyone.reply",
      "A lot of talk goes into how Facebook or other social media use algorithms to encourage engagement, that often includes outrage type content, fake news, rabbit holes and so on.But here's the thing ... people CHOOSE to engage with that, and users even produce that content for social media platforms for free.It's hard to escape that part.I remember trying Bluesky and while I liked it better than Twitter, for me it was disappointing that it was just Twitter, but different.  Outlandish short posts, same lame jokes / pithy appeals to our emotions, and so on. People on there want to behave the same way they wanted to on Twitter.reply",
      "> But here's the thing ... people CHOOSE to engageKinda, but they also don't really realise that they have much more control over the feed than they expect (in certain areas)For the reel/tiktok/foryou-instagram feeds, it shows you subjects that you engage with. It will a/b other subjects that similar people engage with. Thats all its doing. continual a/b to see if you like what ever flavour of bullshit is popular.Most people don't realise that you can banish posts from your feeds by doing a long press \"I don't like this\" equivalent. It takes a few times for the machine to work out if its an account, groups of accounts of theme that you don't like, and it'll stop showing it to you. (threads for example took a very long time to stop showing me fucking sports.)Why don't more people know this? because it hurts short term metrics for what ever bollocks the devs are working on. so its not that well advertised. just think how unsuccessful the experiments in the facebook app would have been if you were able to block the \"other posts we think you might like\" experiments. How sad Zuckerberg would be that his assertion was actually bollocks?reply",
      "There's definitely a mass of people who can't/won't/don't get past passive/least-effort relationships with things on screens. These would be the type that in the TV days would simply leave the TV on a specific channel all day and just watch whatever was on, and probably haven't changed their car radio dial from the station they set it to when they bought the car. In modern times they probably have their cable TV they still pay for on a 24 hour news channel and simply have that going all day.To be fair, in times far past, you really didn't have much choice in TV or radio channels, and I suspect it's this demographic that tend to just scroll down Facebook and take what it gives without much thought other than pressing Like on stuff.reply",
      "Yup. Knowing the exact percentage of those people would be hurtful to my soul I think, but I suspect they drive a meaningful percentage of business. Like that time when Netflix displayed shows on, because some people couldn't be bothered to actually choose something to watch ?reply",
      "Transparency would prove or disprove this. Release the algorithm and let us decide for ourselves. In my experience, Instagram made an algorithm change 3-4 years ago. It used to be that my feed was exactly my interests. Then overnight my feed changed. It became a mix of 1. interracial relationship success stories 2. scantily clad women clickbait, 3. east asian \"craft project\" clickbait, and just general clickbait. It felt as if \"here's what other people like you are clicking on\" became part of the algorithm.reply"

    "first_paragraph": "\n      \"The [structural] mechanism producing these problematic outcomes is really robust and hard to resolve.\"\n    It's no secret that much of social media has become profoundly dysfunctional. Rather than bringing us together into one utopian public square and fostering a healthy exchange of ideas, these platforms too often create filter bubbles or echo chambers. A small number of high-profile users garner the lion's share of attention and influence, and the algorithms designed to maximize engagement end up merely amplifying outrage and conflict, ensuring the dominance of the loudest and most extreme users\u2014thereby increasing polarization even more.Numerous platform-level intervention strategies have been proposed to combat these issues, but according to a preprint posted to the physics arXiv, none of them are likely to be effective. And it's not the fault of much-hated algorithms, non-chronological feeds, or our human proclivity for seeking out negativity. Rather, the dynamics that giv"

Importantly, this is not about protecting against an attacker that can make arbitrary requests2 (as an attacker doesn\u2019t know the user\u2019s cookies), but about working with browsers to identify authenticated requests initiated from untrusted sources.Unlike Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which is about sharing responses across origins, CSRF is about accepting state-changing requests, even if the attacker will not see the response.
