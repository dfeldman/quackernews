      "Seems to be cool, but, one of thing that most annoys me on studying machine learning is that I may dive as deep as it is possible in theory, but I can't see how it connects to the practice, i. e. how it makes me choose the correct number of neurons in a layer, how many layers, the activation functions, if I should use a neural network or other techniques, and so on...If someone have something explaining that I'll be grateful\n \nreply",
      "Maybe this will help:https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook\n \nreply",
      "Most things can't be learned via pure theory or pure practice. Almost nothing related to work in the modern day can.In ML not everything can be derived from theory. If it could, we'd not have been so surprised by the performance of really really large language models. At the same time, if you can't reason about the math involved, you are going to have a difficult time figuring why something isn't working or what options you have - could be around architecture or loss functions or choice of activation function or optimizer or hyperparameters or training time/resources or a dozen other things.\n \nreply",
      "Beginner here. A takeaway I got from the Andrew Ng's Coursera course (specifically for neural networks) is that adding more neurons and layers than the \"minimum needed\" is usually okay (that is, no risk of overfitting when considering reasonable regularization terms.) Sadly, there is no rule for that minimum, so you must do trial and error; on the other side, carelessly extending the network will be inefficient and eventually slow.\nFor the activation functions, the output layer's is mostly determined by the problem being tackled, and for the inner layers you usually start with ReLU and then try some of the common variants using some heuristics (again related to the current problem.)\nOf course you should consider other successful models for similar problems as your starting point.\n \nreply",
      "I think you're just more interested in the practical side of ML which is totally fine!I'm a bit skeptical of how much math and theory the average MLE actually needs. Obviously they do need some, but how much? I'm not sure.But on the other hand, the theoreticians often need much more math. Something like the SVM could only have been invented by a math genius like Vapnik.\n \nreply",
      "> how it makes me choose the correct number of neurons in a layer, how many layers, the activation functionSeeing massive ablation studies on each one of those in just about every ML paper should be fairly indicative that nobody knows shit about fuck when it comes to that. Just people trying things out randomly and seeing what works, copying ideas from each other resulting in some vague guidelines. It's the worst field if you want things to be logical and explainable. It's mostly labelling datasets, paying for compute and hoping for the best.\n \nreply",
      "> nobody knows shit about fuck when it comes to thatThis is why I've abandoned neural networks as a computational substrate for genetic programming experiments.Tape-based UTMs may be extremely rigid in how they execute instruction streams, but at least you can eventually understand and describe everything that contributes to their behavior.Changing the fan-out from 12 to 15 in a NN is like ancient voodoo ritual compared to realizing a program tape is probably not long enough based upon rough entropy measures.\n \nreply",
      "> all of the aboveNFL says something about it being a wash for arbitrary data. All results are going to be tuned to assumptions we have about our data in particular (not too many discontinuities, sufficiently well sampled, ...).> neurons in a layer, how many layers, ...Scaling laws are, currently, empirically derived. From those you can pick your goals (e.g., at most $X and maximize accuracy) and work backward to one or more optimal sets of parameters. Except in very restricted domains or with other strong assumptions I haven't seen anything giving you more than that.> activation functionsAll of the above about how it can't matter for arbitrary data and how parameters need to be empirically derived apply. However: An important inductive bias a lot of practitioners use is that every weight in the model should be roughly equally important. There are other ways you choose activation functions, especially in specialized domains, but when designing a deep network one of the most important things you can do is control the magnitude of information at each level of backpropagation. If your activation function (and surrounding infrastructure) approximately handles that problem then it's probably good enough.> neural network or other techniquesFor almost every problem you're better off using something other than a neural network (like catboost). I don't have any good intuition for why that's the case. Test them both. That's what the validation dataset is for.> how it connects to the practiceFor this article in particular, it doesn't connect to a ton of what I personally do. I'm sure it resonates with someone. As soon as pytorch or jax or whatever isn't good enough though and you have to go implement stuff from scratch, you need a deep dive in the theory you're implementing. To a lesser degree, if you're interfacing with big frameworks nontrivially or working around their limitations, you still need a deep understanding of the things you're implementing.Imagine, e.g., that you want all the modern ML tools in a world where dynamic allocation, virtual functions, and all that garbage aren't tractable. You can resoundedly beat every human heuristic for phantom touchpad events in your mouse driver with a tiny neural network, but you can't use pytorch to do it without turning your laptop into a space heater.Embedded devices aren't the only scenario where you might have to venture off the beaten path. Much like the age-old argument of importing a data structure vs writing your own, as soon as you have requirements beyond what the library author provides it's often worth it to do the whole thing on your own, and it takes a firm theoretical foundation to do so swiftly and correctly.> how it connects to practiceThat's a criticism I have of a lot of educational materials. Connecting the dots is important in writing (competing with all the advantages of brevity).Pick on the Model-Based Learning section as an example. We're asked, to start, to MLE a gaussian. (M)aximum (L)ikelihood (E)stimation is an extremely important concept, and a lot of ML practitioners throw it to the side.Imagine, e.g., a 2-stage process where for each price bracket you have a model reporting the likelihood of conversion and then a second stage where you synthesize those predictions into an optimal strategy. Common failure modes include (a) mishandling variance, (b) assuming that MLE on each of the models allows you to combine the mean/mode/... results into an MLE composite action, (c) really an extension of [b], but if you have the wrong loss function for your model(s) then they aren't meaningfully combinable, ....Something that should be obvious (predict conversion rates, combine those rates to determine what you should do) has tons of pitfalls if you don't holistically reason about the composite process. That's perhaps a failure in the primitives we use to construct those composite processes, but in today's day and age it's still something you have to consider.How does the book connect? I dunno. It looks more like a \"kata\" (keep your fundamental skills sharp) than anything else. An explicit connection to some real-world problem might make it more tractable.\n \nreply",
      "Funny how mathematicians always try to sneak their linear algebra and matrix theory into ML.  If you didn't know any better, you'd think academicians had invented LLMs and are the experts to be consulted with.If anything academicians and theoreticians held ML back and forced generations of grad students doing symbolic proofs, like in this example, just because computational techniques were too lowbrow for them.\n \nreply",

      "This is very cool. I still think MS RDP is the best remote desktop client and protocol. The performance is just insanely good, and the client is easily available on 95% of computers. The multi-monitor support is also awesome. The only downside is that it's Microsoft...\n \nreply",
      "If you think RDP performance is good, you should try Sunshine+Moonlight. I regularly stream at 4k 120hz from my gaming PC to my laptop and it's basically indistinguishable from running locally. I've even run it over Tailscale from a thousand miles away (though at 1080p60) and it was still markedly better than RDP.Caveats - You really want a Windows host for fully accelerated on-GPU hardware video encoding, the server setup is _slightly_ more involved than RDP which is usually preinstalled, and Sunshine+Linux+NVidia requires an annoying driver patch. But overall it's _amazing_.\n \nreply",
      "I'd still pick RDP for remote managing any day, its server and client are so much better integrated (clipboard, peripherals, etc.) for this task than Sunshine/Moonlight. It also avoids the whole issue of setting up a virtual display output[1] as is required by Sunshine. I use both for different tasks.On a related note, as of recent versions, Sunshine and Moonlight stable releases support 4:4:4 chroma subsampling and bitrates up to 500Mbit/s with HEVC, which results in almost indistinguishable image quality compared to native output[2]. Bitrates that high are unusual in normal content, but at least Apple's Media Engine (on M-series Macs) appears to be capable of decoding it.[1] Here is a pretty good solution that piggybacks off of Parsec's driver, which is fully signed, though its EDID lacks HDR support. The project also includes a C header file for custom implementations: https://github.com/nomi-san/parsec-vdd[2] Note: I found that I had to enable 10-bit color streaming (which is available when using Parsec's driver) to get rid of some gradient banding that isn't present in native 8-bit. I suspect it's some encoder and/or color space issue.\n \nreply",
      "TBH, After trying both I'd still pick RDP (I used xRDP server on linux) for anything text/GUI related. RDP(not VNC or VNC larpin as RDP) doesn't make image compression artifacts when the connection gets bad it's just add some lag keeping the text crisp.Sunshine/Moonlight on the other hand reduce image quality keeping the latency low, which is really good when streaming games for example.\n \nreply",

      "I use Sunshine and Moonlight when I'm out away from my Windows laptop in my home office and back near the router in the front room over my Macbook air, it's great when you can get directly on the LAN with it. But then, RDP is also better over the LAN, and casual disconnection is easier.But if I want to do graphics-intensive work on the headless tower, I'll use Sunshine and Moonlight.\n \nreply",
      "> I regularly stream at 4k 120hz from my gaming PC to my laptop and it's basically indistinguishable from running locallySunshine+Moonshine is great but lets not exaggerate. On controller it feels fine, on mouse it is still a noticeable difference from local play. I'd compare it to turning on classic v-sync (so not fast sync).\n \nreply",
      "There are a few disadvantages, in sunshine/moonlight such as you still have monitor output, so you are stuck to the resolutions supported by your monitor and someone can see what you are doing. Of course there are workarounds like dummy monitors.I do not have clipboard sharing working (I\u2019m not sure if it is even supported) and there is a bug where some specific keys (including \\) do not work on some keyboard layouts (Japanese for example), although there is already a pull request that supposedly fix that.Still it is an amazing solution. The snappiness of having full 3D acceleration is amazing, and as another plus it works in the home edition of Windows.\n \nreply",
      "> in sunshine/moonlight such as you still have monitor outputApollo[1] fixes this problem really neatly - there's a \"Virtual Desktop\" option that adds a virtual desktop, and you can disable all the local monitors while in this session so that a local person doesn't see your desktop while you're remoted into it (just remember to lock after you end your session!).I believe it also preserves monitor layouts when starting/ending sessions.I used Sunshine and had a bunch of hacks in the startup/teardown scripts to get the same behavior but it was really brittle.

To me it just proves that they don't understand the very basic of how encryption works.Especially these days in Europe, it seems completely insane: it is already a problem that most companies use US services, given that the US have become hostile to Europe.

Organized crime is on the rise since 2004? Maybe a bit before.Politicians \"reformed\" the police, removed our \"proximity police\" which were basically social workers with physical and weapon training, who also were a great point of contact for future informants as it built a lot of trust in some cities (mostly western and northern France: it didn't work as well in the south and in Paris, but it worked truly great were i lived and their removal killed a lot of initiatives. My bet is that the failure in Marseille and Paris killed the initiative which worked great in small to medium cities).And then circa 2008 they added another police reform that basically pushed police towards targeting petty criminals. Petty criminals turned to organized crime \"en masse\", and nowaday you have basically 3 crime families who run most of the crime in France. They reached Paris around 2011-2014, divided it cleanly around 2017 (i've heard multiple people talking about a missile launcher sighted in the 93 around 2015-2016 when i lived there, in at least 2 different location) and now politicians act surprised.\n \nreply",

They will ask you to boot it up\u2026 when you\u2019ll not be able to do that, they\u2019ll will not listen to your story and will just keep the computer.\n\n  [3] The solution you propose will just make you look like a dangerous bad guy to the border guards.

      "> Of course they are considered problematic in Rust.\n> And leaks are hard to code by accident in Rust.\n> ...I enjoyed this gem and its descendants from the comments. What I see instead, commonly, even in big rust projects, is that it's easy to accidentally define something with a longer lifetime than you intend. Some of that happens accidentally (not recognizing the implications of an extra reference here and there when the language frees things based on static detections of being unused). Much more of it happens because the compiler fights against interesting data structures -- e.g., the pattern of allocating a vec as pseudo-RAM, using indices as pseudo-pointers, and never freeing anything till the container itself is unused.There's nothing wrong with those techniques per se, but the language tends to paint you into a bit of a corner if you're not very good and very careful, so leaks are a fact of life in basically every major Rust project I've seen not written by somebody like BurntSushi, even when that same sort of project would not have a leak in a GC language.\n \nreply",

      "Because of the nature of the data (resettlements for dam construction) two thirds of the data is from China. But interestingly according to Figure 7 [1] the discrepancy exists even in countries with normally very meticulous record keeping, like Sweden and Germany. I find this surprising.The root cause analysis also falls short for those cases: Germany's bureaucracy might be underfunded but fundamentally requires every resident to register at their place of residence. There is also no large-scale conflict or violence in Germany, no regions are really remote or hard to reach, all rural areas are electrified (important for satellite-based night-time light counting by GRUMP and WorldPop). The only satisfying root causes left are about satellite counting methods being too coarse or badly tuned to accurately count rural area, or rural living patterns possibly not fitting the assumptions of these models.

Bingo's letting her rabbit go did not mean a complete separation but an expansion (as a few additional rabbits came to help later) similar to a parent allowing a child to grow up and leave while affirming that the child is loved.Bluey also has some similarity to Calvin and Hobbes in that some fantastic elements are not explained.

      "One thing that I learned from going to IC to manager:there is a LOT of activity at the manager level that you never see and therefore don't often think about when you are an IC.Case in point: trying to retain good people.Good people often times end up wanting to leave for a variety of reasons ranging from ludicrous to 100% legitimate. They often announce they are leaving to their direct manager and maybe one other person (E.g. head of another team they work with etc).Given that they are good and worth keeping, this triggers escalations, meetings with the employee and between managers, senior managers and HR. In the best case, this leads to a successful retention.However, the only people that know any of this happened are the employee and the manager tier. The other employees have zero idea any of this occurred unless someone shares/mentions it. I point this out b/c multiple times as an IC, I thought \"no one will care if I leave b/c I never see managers actively trying to keep people\".The point of this story is twofold:\n- managers do a lot of \"unseen\" work\n- it's worth researching this kind of thing if you are about to move from IC to manager.\n \nreply",
      "I agree about the hidden work, but you describe it in a reactionary manner.A huge amount of management effort goes into being proactive so you don't even need to get to the point in the conversation where they voice wanting to leave. Or when they do, you've seen it coming, have plans in place and they move on with your blessing.* Creating a culture where employees (and managers) feel valued and have autonomy.* Ensuring employees are clear about where they are headed, giving them something to work towards.* Proactively identifying and unblocking issues before they become crises, often across functions.* Identifying areas of frustrations for teams and individuals.That's just a small number of the things you'll be doing, and whilst scope varies massively by company size (though until you get to the large corp environment most of this is still covered up to the VP / CTO level), you'll be juggling it all alongside technical input, cross functional leadership responsibilities (VP may well be in the SLT if the company isn't huge), horizon scanning, constant process refinement.. The pillars of people, process and technology all need to be constantly considered..Having done this repeatedly from IC all the way through Head, Director and VP level (and up to CTO), I can say that being a proactive problem solver is always required of a good manager / Director / VP.Edit: Having read the actual article ;)IC paths map this quite well too..Tech Lead maps to manager, Staff maps to Director, Principal to VP\n \nreply",
      "You can only be so proactive.  At a ginormous company, the pace of change is glacial.  You can push really hard and get buy-in from leaders with hundreds of people under them and still get blocked trying to improve things about the office/culture that are simply beyond one's control - even with VP buy-in.  Big companies need to federate out more if they want this type of proactive management - or just accept it and maybe that makes sense too.\n \nreply",
      "If you are a manager, would you accept that from a subordinate who failed to do their job successfully?The nature of work is that it's not a cleanroom lab or a business school case study; lots of difficult and unfair obstacles exist, and your job is to overcome them. To me, that defines 'job' like the sea defines 'sailor'. You're very lucky when that isn't the case.Realistically, there is some judgment involved and matters of degree, and there are limitations, but the best people find a way using the resources they have.\n \nreply",
      "Indeed, don't ignore obvious issues like team morale, career paths for ICs, but there's a certain zen to the balance between proactive and reactive. Don't do too much proactive work if there isn't incremental return on it. Don't burn yourself out or set yourself up for deep disappointment.Mid-pandemic I saw another manager go from enthusiastic to despondent overnight when his upcoming hiring headcount was cut to zero and his lovingly cultivated recruiting pipeline was basically worthless. He left shortly after, unsurprisingly. It was painful to watch and taught me a lesson in contingent value in management. I don't mean to say I know better though, he was definitely a better manager than me lol.\n \nreply",

      "This is very true and I learned this quickly when moving to a management role. As an IC, when someone is out for some life event, it might mean more work for you to pick up the slack. As a manager, everyone on your team's problems become your problems.Cancer/long-term illness, death in the family, miscarriages, etc all weigh heavily on my mind when something happens to one of my direct reports.Not asking for pity, but being a manager has a heavy emotional toll if you have even the slightest bit of empathy that I don't think most ICs appreciate fully.\n \nreply"

Entire sponsored videos for stuff like gambling.Of course, it is hard to argue that the oft. underpaid content producers are really the ones making ethical concessions when they exist under a system that... underfunds them... but nevertheless it is undeniable that there are ethical concessions, and these concessions are made because they increase revenue.The really really sad part is that you really only see big creators throwing doing this stuff despite already having more than enough, and they always get away with it, whereas if a small creator were to pull this their audience would eat them alive.\n \nreply",
      "> Onlyfans creators creating pseudo-relationships.Twitch, as well. I've stopped watching streamer after streamer when it became clear they were only responding to people throwing money at them constantly.I've watched people spend $50-100 a night with a streamer. It's insane. Well over $10k a year.The same people probably write a $100 check to the local food pantry.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah it\u2019s hard for me to watch. I feel sorry for the people so attention deprived that they need to throw dozens of dollars at a streamer who makes 10000 a night for any sort of acknowledgment\n \nreply",
      "Have you considered self-hosting a payment page? I'm asking because I've been building Open Payment Host[1] a self-hosted FOSS payments host supporting multiple payment gateways; still very much a WIP but I hope soon it will be viable enough for someone like you.P.S. Please ignore the AI autocomplete feature, I included it as part of Google hackathon to raise funds for the project; I'll be removing it in the upcoming release.[1] https://github.com/abishekmuthian/open-payment-host\n \nreply",
      "What does your app do differently than something like coindrop[0] which is essentially a linktree page linking to all donation platforms for a creator[0] https://coindrop.to/\n \nreply",
      "Open Payment Host seems to connect to credit card gateways (Stripe/Square) whereas coindrop seems to link to P2P style payment methods where you are sending funds to an \"address\".\n \nreply",
      "I follow a lot of very small youtube creators. I can often convince them to start a liberapay just for me to donate. They get 100% of the cut* (Patreon takes 12-16%) and I am supporting both the creator and Liberapay's popularityThe main downside is lack of integrations with the tiered perks Patreon offers. Most of the creators I follow don't really rely too heavily on the feature but I can see it becoming a larger hassle if a creator has to manage two platforms* less fees\n \nreply",
      "Just out of interest because it sounds a little too good to be true, but it the content creators keep 100% of the donations, how are LibrePay funding the operation itself ?Edit : My lazy self actually went and read up on it :> Liberapay does not take a cut of payments, the service is funded by the donations to its own account. However there are payment processing fees.This is a great example of dogfooding.\n \nreply",
      "Yup, liberapay is funded by donations on liberapayhttps://liberapay.com/Liberapay/They're the second largest recipient\n \nreply"
