      "It\u2019s ancient history now but in 2012, the team behind the Paper drawing app for iPad shared interesting details about their color mixing: https://www.fastcompany.com/3002676/magical-tech-behind-pape...In short, they first implemented realistic pigment mixing behavior. But in user testing it turned out non-painters are not good at getting the color they want by mixing; you usually end up with brown. So they had to make an unrealistic mixing algorithm that felt more intuitive.\n \nreply",
      "That's very interesting!My first thought, looking at the webpage: \"Huh, that's neat. I didn't know that painting software didn't even attempt to do color mixing beyond naive interpolation, though I guess it figures; the physics behind all the light stuff must be fairly gnarly, and there's a lot of information lost in RGB that probably can't be just reconstructed.\"Scrolling down a bit: \"Huh, there's some snippets for using it as a library. Wait, it does operations in RGB? What's going on here?\"Finally, clicking the paper link, I found the interesting bit: \"We  achieve this by establishing a latent color space, where RGB colors are represented as mixtures of primary pigments together with additive residuals. The latents can be manipulated with linear operations, leading to expected, plausible results.\"That's very clever, and seems like a great use for modern machine learning techniques outside the fashionable realm of language models. It uses perceptual color spaces internally too, and physics based priors. All around very technically impressive and beautiful piece of work.It rhymes with an idea that's been floating in my head for a bit - would generative image models, or image encoder models, work better if rather than rgb, we fed them with wavelength data, or at least a perceptually uniform color space? Seems it'd be closer to truth than arbitrarily using the wavelengths our cone cells happen to respond to (and roughly, at that).\n \nreply",

      "This would be an awesome build your own 8bit computer project - I would buy it to do together with my kids. Super cool\n \nreply",
      "I like this project!  The PCB looks clean, and has a lean, but complete set of components.160x200 video is a mistake however.  Those pixels are twice as wide as they are tall, in NTSC signaling to be perfectly fair.  And to be a bit more fair, using that resolution can mean eliminating color \"dot crawl\" common to devices outputting a composite color video signal, which this little computer appears to do.Now I have written quite a bit of video related code for the Propeller 1 chip featured in this project.  It is possible to compromise and double the video resolution to 320x200 and still maintain that crisp look seen in the product photos.The secret is to avoid the color signal interlacing, and or output s-video, which is separated Luma and chroma signals similar to the C64 output signal.  Additionally, one can get these little S-video to composite adapters that work pretty well on a non s-video capable display, though the Propeller can offer either video signal just for the asking, and the same video circuit is used for both.With NTSC, anything over 160 pixels in the active video area, which is the signal inside the borders seen in the product photos on the project page, tends to leave fringing between high contrast pixels.  Contrast being say, red and blue, which are far apart on the color wheel.  This is caused by the low resolution of the NTSC color signal itself being superimposed onto the monochrome Luma signal in the composite, single RCA jack output case.What I did for my video drivers, which can be found on the Parallax site with usually an MIT license, was to simply not interlace the color signal.  The spec calls for the color timing to be such that every other scan line is out of phase relative to the prior scan line.  This allows for 320 pixel color resolution with the cost being the fringing at high contrast pixel transitions.If the driver simply does not do that, the result is a bit less sharp color, but also no shimmering in the text.  That works pretty well with composite on most displays.And when S-video is used, doing the interlace simply improves on the non interlaced color, making it sharper.A propeller chip video generation is almost entirely software driven, which means one can do just about anything with the output signal.  It is really a fun device.In my opinion, a 40x25 text display with 7 bits per character, rather than the 4 bits seen on the CODY, would be a whole lot easier to read.The good news is anyone can do that due to how the Propeller is a  software driven video device.All that said, the project author may have intended a specific look and feel, and if that is the case, the project looks like a home run!\n \nreply"

Work's not as much of an 'engine' as those are, but it's definitely turned out a big focus is on how customers can build their own stuff (both in the frontend and the data side) and integration.

But if it had not have been him, it would have been someone else, who likely would have been more or less as successful.Personally, I think that Bezos' relentless focus on customer service was the biggest factor in amzn's early success, combined with his near-insane quality standards for the people he was willing to hire.\n \nreply",

Is that wrong?  It makes it sound like the particular way Bezos was lucky was by happening to be smart, smarter than the rest of us who were paying attention to what was going on.

It's just not the general case for consumer stuff.I think Cloud computing as a successful business comes from the same process as suggested though. It's hard to build the platform as a business by itself.Amazon's cloud is an offshoot of their internal elastic computing needs. Google's cloud sort of is too. Microsoft's cloud is an offshoot of their enterprise software business, same with Oracle's. IBM has been renting computers to businesses since like forever, but they used to make calculators and typewriters. I've never understood what Salesforce does, but I dunno, now it does it in the cloud rather than customer hosted?There's some maybe purer cloud businesses, but mostly they started with a simpler hosting model and expanded into cloudy offerings.If steam was always meant to be an all the games store, it certainly didn't start that way.

The Maastricht treaty (signed February 1992, effective November 1993) established the European Union (EU), and renamed the \"European Economic Community\" (EEC) to the \"European Community\" (EC). Alongside the EEC-now-EC, there was also the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC, dissolved in 2002) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom, still exists), and the three linked Communities were known as the \"European Communities\", which was another expansion of \"EC\". And the EC formed one of the pillars of the European Union, until the Lisbon treaty (signed December 2007, effective December 2009) merged the European Community into the EU and it ceased to independently exist, although Euratom continues as essentially a subsidiary body of the EU.

All of that work to try to make this feature plausibly private is cool engineering work, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with implementing a feature like this, but it should absolutely be opt-in.Trust in software will continue to erode until software stops treating end users and their data and resources (e.g. network connections) as the vendor's own playground. Local on-device data shouldn't be leaking out of radio interfaces unexpectedly, period. There should be a user intent tied to any feature where local data is sent out to the network.So why didn't Apple just simply ask for user permission to enable this feature?

These days a great SDK, not a great API, is a hallmark, and maybe even a necessity, of a world class development experience.I'm of the opposite mind. A simple API that I can just call with Fetch is far better than having to learn most SDKs. Stripe's Node.js SDK is fairly clean/without headaches, but I look at stuff like the AWS JS SDK and want to gouge my eyes out.At least with an HTTP API, there's some modicum of standardization. SDKs are and will always be the wild west. The only exception with this that I see frequently is authentication. Some are simple Authorization headers w/ a Bearer <Token>, others (like PayPal the last time I implemented it) require an undocumented base64 encoding of the token.\n \nreply",

It's just there, and because you don't know who needs what, you can never remove it or migrate away.By requiring the caller to tell you what it wants, you gain an upper hand. You can throttle callers that request everything, and it gives you an elegant and graceful way to migrate the systems under the hood without impacting the SLA for all callers. You also learn which callers are using which data and can have independent conversations, migrations, and recommendations for them.Each sub-entity type being requested probably has a whole host of other systems maintaining that data, and so you're likely dealing with active-active writes across service boundaries, cache replication and invalidation, service calls, and a lot of other complexity that the caller will never see. You don't want the entire universe of this in every request.It's a nightmare to have everything in the line of every request for simply legacy reasons. If you have to return lots of sub-entities for everyone all the time, you're more likely to have outages when subsystems fail, thundering herd problems when trying to recover because more systems are involved, and longer engineering timelines due to added complexity of keeping everything spinning together.By making the caller tell you what they need, you quantitatively know which systems are the biggest risk and impact for migrations. This moves the world into a more maintainable state with better downstream ownership. Every request semantically matches what the caller actually wants, and it hits the directly responsible teams.Stripe might also be dealing with a lot of legacy migrations internally, so this might have also been motivated as they move to a better internal state of the world. Each sub-entity type might be getting new ownership.Grab bag APIs are hell for the teams that maintain them. And though the callers don't know it, they're bad for them too.\n \nreply",

      "When Bluesky announced they were taking on large amounts of capital to handle the growth that's when I knew their days were numbered. Capital requires returns, and a lot of the degradation of the user experience in the past few years is due to catering to investors and advertisers (who are the actual customers).Decentralization as is promised is one way to mitigate this, but there's no economic incentive to go through with it. Investors will encourage Bluesky to kick that can down the road until people forgot they ever promised it in the first place.That said, we will have a good amount of time with Bluesky as a more positive site before these changes kick in. But my hunch is that it'll be shorter than previous cycles. The rate of profit has fallen and investors don't have as much grace for companies that grow without revenue as they did 10-15 years ago.Of all the sites that emerged out of the internet renaissance starting in the late 90's, it seems the only one that has hung on and still provides a good value, despite all it's issues, is Wikipedia. And that has to be because it's a non-profit powered by volunteer labor with no need to optimize revenue or make a profit.I often dream of recreating the classic web using a very low cost subscription model (since cheap is better than free, because free is never truly free) and apps that are bootstrapped or crowdfunded instead of vc funded. Decentralization in that circumstance is much more achievable and way less of a threat, although it still comes with a ton of technical and political considerations.\n \nreply",
