Jeff Dean, my intern host and one of the\nauthors of gsearch, suggested that it would be cool to build a web interface\nthat, in effect, let you run gsearch over the world's public source code.\nI thought that sounded fun, so that's what I did that summer.\nDue primarily to an excess of optimism in our original schedule,\nthe launch slipped to October, but on October 5, 2006 we did\nlaunch (by then I was back at school but still a part-time intern)."
