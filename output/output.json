      "Not that we would literally do this with Voyager, but it makes me wonder at the potential utility of a string of probes, one sent every couple of [insert correct time interval, decades, centuries?], to effectively create a communication relay stretching out into deep space somewhere.My understanding with the Voyagers 1 and 2 is (a) they will run out of power before they would ever get far enough to benefit from a relay and (b) they benefited from gravity slingshots due to planetary alignments that happen only once every 175 years.So building on the Voyager probes is a no-go. But probes sent toward Alpha Centauri that relay signals? Toward the center of the Milky Way? Toward Andromeda? Yes it would take time scales far beyond human lifetimes to build out anything useful, and even at the \"closest\" scales it's a multi year round trip for information but I think Voyager, among other things, was meant to test our imaginations, our sense of possible and one thing they seem to naturally imply is the possibility of long distance probe relays.Edit: As others rightly note, the probes would have to communicate with lasers, not with the 1970s radio engineering that powered Voyagers 1 and 2.reply",
      "What you are describing has been proposed before, for example within context of projects like Breakthrough Starshot. In that the case the idea is to launch thousands of probes, each weighing only a few grams or less, and accelerating them to an appreciable fraction of the speed of light using solar sails and (powerful) earth-based lasers. The probes could reach alpha centauri within 20-30 years. There seems to be some debate though about whether cross-links between probes to enable relaying signals is ever practical from a power and mass perspective vs a single very large receiver on earth.reply",
      "Indeed. I think the main reason to send thousands of probes is increasing the odds that they will survive the trip and also be in the right position to gather usable data to transmit back.Also once you have created the infrastructure of hundreds or thousands of very powerful lasers to accelerate the tiny probes to incredibel speeds, sending many probes instead of a few doesn't add much to the cost anyway.reply",
      "I bet you that this hasn't been proposed, though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfClJxdQ6XsI found that video very interesting! Especially the second half about apparent superliminal speedreply",
      "If I don't recall wrongly, Breakthrough Starshot was not a means for commnunicaiton relay as he describes.reply",
      "It wasn't intended for a communications relay, but it was intended to have 2-way communication. I went down a rabbit hole reading ArXiv papers about it. Despite their tiny size, the probes could phone home with a smaller laser - according to the papers I read, spinning the photons a certain way would differentiate them from other photons, and we apparently have the equipment to detect and pick up those photons. The point of the communication would be for them to send back data and close-up images of the Alpha C system. Likewise, they could receive commands from earth by having dozens of probes effectively act as an interferometry array.reply",
      "No one likes to think this but it\u2019s very possible voyager is the farthest humanity will go. In fact realistically speaking it is the far more likeliest possibility.reply",
      "Provided we don't wipe ourselves out, there's no technical reason why we can't go interstellar. It's just way harder and more energy intensive than most people imagine, so I doubt it's happening any time in the next few hundred years.But we already understand the physics and feasibility of \"slow\" (single-digit fractions of c) interstellar propulsion systems. Nuclear pulse propulsion and fission fragment rockets require no new physics or exotic engineering leaps and could propel a probe to the stars, if one was so inclined. Fusion rockets would do a bit better, although we'd have to crack the fusion problem first. These sorts of things are well out of today's technology, but it's not unforeseeable in a few centuries. You could likewise imagine a generation ship a few centuries after that powered by similar technology.The prerequisite for interstellar exploration is a substantial exploitation of our solar system's resources: terraform Mars, strip mine the asteroid belt, build giant space habitats like O'Neill cylinders. But if we ever get to that point - and I think it's reasonable to think we will, given enough time - an interstellar mission becomes the logical next step.Will we ever get to the point where traveling between the stars is commonplace? No, I doubt it. But we may get to the point where once-in-a-century colonization missions are possible, and if that starts, there's no limit to humanity colonizing the Milky Way given a few million years.reply",

By November 15, 2026, it will be 16.1 billion miles (25.9 billion km) away, meaning a radio signal will take a full 24 hours\u2014a full light-day\u2014to reach it. For context, a light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion km), so one light-day is just a tiny fraction of that.Launched in 1977 to explore Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012, becoming the most distant human-made object ever. Traveling at around 11 miles per second (17.7 km/s), it adds roughly 3.5 astronomical units (the distance from Earth to the Sun) each year.

      "I disagree with the framing in 2.1 a lot.  > Models look god-tier on paper:\n  >  they pass exams\n  >  solve benchmark coding tasks\n  >  reach crazy scores on reasoning evals\n\nModels don't look \"god-tier\" from benchmarks. Surely an 80% is not godlike. I would really like more human comparisons for these benchmarks to get a good idea of what an 80% means though.I would not say that any model shows a \"crazy\" score on ARC-AGI.I broadly have seen incremental improvements in benchmarks since 2020, mostly at a level I would believe to be below average human reasoning, but above average human knowledge. No one would call GPT-3 godlike and it is quite similar to modern models in benchmarks; it is not a difference of like 1% vs 90%. I think most people would consider gpt-3 to be closer to opus 4.5 than opus 4.5 is to a human.reply",

They also know it will be extremely difficult to raise more capital if their pitch is \"we need to go back to research, which might return nothing at all.\"Ilya did also acknowledge that these houses will still generate gobs of revenue, despite being at a dead end, so I'm not sure what the criticism is, exactly.Everyone knows another breakthrough is required for agi to arrive; sama explicitly said this.

For some people that means post scarcity, for others it means a world dominating AGI that achieves escape velocity against the current gridlock of geopolitics, for still others it means ejecting the pesky labour class and replacing all labour needs with AI and robots. Varied needs, but all perceived as urgent and inescapable by their vested interests.reply",

As Dwarkesh also said, we reach to a safe and eventually perfect system by deploying it in public and iterating over it until optimal convergence dictated by users in a free market. Hence, I trust that Google, OpenAI or Anthropic will reach there, not SSI.reply",

It's a pity that people don't use it enough (ABUSE it!). I use it as a TUI / CLI tool to orchestrate tasks and workflows.> Fun fact: I found Gemini CLI pretty good at judging/critiquing code generated by other tools LoLRecently I even hook it up with homebrew via MCP (other Linux package managers as well?), and a local LLM powered Knowledge/Context Manager (Nowledge Mem), you can get really creative abusing Gemini CLI, unleash the Gemini power.I've also seen people use Gemini CLI in SubAgents for MCP Processing (it did work and avoided polluting the main context), can't help laughing when I first read this -> https://x.com/goon_nguyen/status/1987720058504982561reply",

Apple clearly hasn't completely dropped AWDL for AirDrop, because you can still AirDrop from iOS 26 to earlier devices.Note that the Ars Technica article never directly makes the claim that Apple supports Airdrop over Wi-Fi Aware. The title is two independent statements - \"The EU made Apple adopt new Wi-Fi standards, and now Android can support AirDrop\" - that's true.> Google doesn\u2019t mention it in either Quick Share post, but if you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s suddenly possible for Quick Share to work with AirDrop, it can almost certainly be credited to European Union regulations imposed under the Digital Markets Act (DMA).Again, they're just theorising.

Make upgrading dependencies a conscious choice, and perhaps have a policy of at most upgrading every X days.reply",
      "As someotherguyy already mentioned, this is a default feature in pnpm.And as far as cat-and-mouse-games go in other package managers, I'd say that pinning dependencies and disabling postinstall scripts is a much better option. Sure, not a foolproof one either, but as good as it gets.edit: misspelled someotherguyy's user namereply",
      "I recently learned that this is (for all intents and purposes) a feature in npm as well, specifically the `--before` flag to `npm install`: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install#before. That was harder than it should've been to figure out; it really needs better marketing.Related to that is the proposal for `stabilityDays`, which seems way more practical: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/8570#issuecomment-33004136.... So rather than merely saying \"I only want package versions more than N days old\", you'd be adding the requirement that \"...and also they should have gone at least N days without a subsequent patch release\". e.g. if mylib@6.0.0 is released, only to be quickly followed by 6.0.1 and 6.0.2, you ideally wouldn't want to risk ever installing the probably-broken 6.0.0 or 6.0.1 based on luck of the draw; the better behavior would be to stick with the last 5.x release until 6.0.2 has aged past the threshold.reply",
      "Why is the community persisting with such poor solutions?reply",
      "What would be a better solution? Do other package managers reliably restrict access to the host system beyond the scope of the project folder?Many quirks come from abilities that were once deemed useful, such as compiling code in other languages after package install.Sure, today, I can disable install scripts if I want but it doesn't change much when I eventually run code from the package anyway.But even restricting access to the file system to the project's root folder would leave many doors open, with or without foreign languages: Node is designed as a general purpose JS runtime, including server-side and build-time usage.The utility of node.js was initially to provide a JS API that, unlike the web platform, is not sandboxed. And npm is the default package manager.This not only allows server-side usage, but also is essential to many early dev scenarios. Back in the days, it might have been SCSS builds using node-gyp (wouldn't recommend). Today it's things like Golang TypeScript or SSGs.So, long story short: as many people before me already said, it's an ecosystem/cultural problem.One thing against npm in this regard was/is its broken lock-file handling until I think version 12 or 16. That led to unintended transitive dependency version changes, breaking any reproducibility.Same for compiling foreign languages.These problems are solved today / not different from other package managers and -registries, as far as I know.The culture of taking breaking changes and dependency bloat lightly has not changed as much, I think, although it's improved.This most important point seems to be related to 3 reasons IMO:- junior developers without experience in library development reaching large audiences- specs, languages, runtime, and the package managers itself going through disruptions and evolutions- rapidly releasing breaking majors, often caused by the above factorsThe combination of these plus the role of the project lead/team who actually decides about the dependencies.There are probably also many projects with unclear roles and many people who can push manifest changes, coupled with habitual access to CI/CD pipelines.reply",

      "Congrats on the interesting project! I was curious to know more about the scientific payload: how did you measure the fluorescence? Did you apply excitation light continuously? Or did you rely on ambient light and correct for it when measuring fluorescence? Did you have a control on earth to compensate for any biological related effects? UV and even blue light can stress or even kill cells, or bleach the fluorescence proteins. How do you expect altitude to influence fluorescence? It would be great to look at some data (could not find it on the blog, or github). Acrylic blocks a substancial portion of the UV light!Edit: Definetely agree with other comment that the whole experience is more important than these details.reply",
      "Thank you for the kind words!\nThe fluorescence was originally meant to be measured with an AS7273 spectrometer (unfortunately bought a different one, still worked fine though), and measuring ~680 nm. Certainly not a great setup but it worked fine. Light was ambient through acrylic, and I found out far too late that UV blocking effects. Despite that, I feel like the data is still somewhat valid, maybe. I did do some testing with it back on earth, though I can't remember how it correlated.The data I have is here: https://github.com/radeeyate/StratoSpore/blob/main/software/... - just be warned that the altitude data still isn't the exact same as it was while in the air (GPS not working so I had to take it from someone else).reply",
      "++++Cool points for that name alone!reply",
      "It's great that opportunities like this exist. Doing a project like this at all is such valuable experience. You must have learned a ton and can take that with you for all future projects. The only real quibble is the experimental setup is not really scientifically valid. UV light on its own kills algae, so you're going to detect a monotonic effect roughly equivalent to the altitude increase assuming a reasonably constant rate of altitude increase just from the cumulative exposure. That's not the same thing as detecting a change purely because of altitude.Who cares, though? Scientists train for many years to learn the details of experimental methods in their specific domain. The engineering and hacking experience on its own is what really matters here.reply",
      "the 1080p ->> 18x10 pixel compression just to yeet images over LoRA is honestly more impressive than the algae partreply",
      "It's amusing but I'm not sure I understand the point. Wouldn't it be better to use that bandwidth for more sensor data?reply",
      "Image data and telemetry were sent in different messages, so it wasn't too much of a bottleneck. The images were about ~100 bytes while the telemetry was roughly 40.reply",
      "This is so interesting. I have nothing to add, other than congratulations, and good luck on your next project.reply"
