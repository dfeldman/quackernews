      "This is the strongest statement in the post:> They have threatened to remove us from their systems if we maintain these safeguards; they have also threatened to designate us a \u201csupply chain risk\u201d\u2014a label reserved for US adversaries, never before applied to an American company\u2014and to invoke the Defense Production Act to force the safeguards\u2019 removal. These latter two threats are inherently contradictory: one labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.This contradictory messaging puts to rest any doubt that this is a strong arm by the governemnt to allow any use. I really like Anthropic's approach here, which is to in turn state that they're happy to help the Governemnt move off of Anthropic. It's a messaging ploy for sure, but it puts the ball in the current administration's court.reply",
      "More like the government is treating this like the near term weapon it actually is and, unlike the Manhattan project, the government seems to have little to no control.reply",
      "Note that they always attempt to exert control they don\u2019t have. They\u2019re always bluffing, and they keep losing. Respond accordingly.reply",
      "Paper tigersreply",
      "The government should be entitled to any lawful use of a product they purchase, not uses dictated solely by the provider.  It's up to courts to decide what lawful  use is, it's not up to these companies to dictate.reply",
      "Terms of Service would like to have a word....Not like limiting uses of products is anything new",
      "Providers are free who they choose to do business with, or not do business with. Are you arguing that the government should be able to compel a provider to allow their use when it\u2019s well documented the government does not respect nor adhere to the rule of law? I think you misunderstand commerce and contract law.reply",
      "Those aren't contradictory at all. If I need a particular type of bolt for my fighter jet but I can only get it from a dodgy Chinese company, then that bolt is a supply chain risk (because they could introduce deliberate defects or simply stop producing it) and also clearly important to national security. In fact, it's a supply chain risk because is important to national security.reply",
      "No, in your example, if the dodgy Chinese company is a supply chain risk due to sabotage, why would they invoke an act to force production of the bolts from the same company for use for national defense preparedness, which would be clearly a national security risk?reply",
      "\"Supply chain risk\" is a specific designation that forbids companies that work with the DOD from working with that company. It would not be applied in your scenario.reply"

      "We'll see how much the AI aspect is true by whether they're thinning out teams equally, or just axing whole initiatives. My impression of Block was that it was mostly a one-trick pony (okay, two if you include CashApp) with a bunch of side initiatives that never seemed to pan out, so I'm expecting it to be more of the latter, with this being more of an admission that they're now in \"maintenance mode\".Either way, I think this is how it's gonna be. Regardless of whether AI significantly increases productivity (40%? come on), layoffs will be preemptory. Executives will see the lack of productivity boost as being due to lack of pressure, and imagine engineers are just using the AI to make their own lives easier rather than to work more efficiently. You can't really double output velocity because your users will see it as too much churn, so the only choice is to lay off half the workforce and double the workload for those who stay. \"Necessity is the mother of invention.\" They'll overlook the fact that the work AI tools provide only encompasses 10% of your job even if they're 100% efficient.reply",
      "I'm convinced that these \"AI Layoffs\" are these companies trying to save face from the absurd overhiring that they did in 2022 and 2023 because apparently they thought that these no-interest loans/free money would just last forever.No one really \"knows\" how to grow businesses so the easiest way to spend a lot of money quickly is hiring lots of people, whether or not they are \"necessary\". Then this free money dries up, interest rates go back up, and now they're stuck with all these employees that they didn't actually need.Some companies like Google and Microsoft just accepted that assholes like me will call their CEOs incompetent and fired lots of people in 2023, but I think other CEOs were kind of embarrassed and held off.  Now they can use AI as a scapegoat and people won't act like they were idiots for hiring twice as many people as they needed.Also, I got declined by Block a year ago.  Glad I was now.reply",
      "Regardless of the reasoning I think it is worth keeping in mind that the times when companies are letting talented experienced people go is also a great time to start the next new big thing.  Talent that might have been unobtanium during a hiring frenzy could now be the building blocks of a new venture.  A lot of these companies were started or really built themselves up during a tech slow down.reply",
      "it's all just saying stuff the shareholders want to hear.  when the shareholders want to hear \"we're staffing up aggressively\" the companies hire.  when the shareholders want to hear \"we're moving workloads to AI\" the companies fire.it's not using AI as a scapegoat.  they're doing this because they're quite literally being rewarded for it.  they could care less what the employees who are getting fired think, as long as the investors are happy.reply",
      "> I'm convinced that these \"AI Layoffs\" are these companies trying to save face from the absurd overhiring that they did in 2022 and 2023 because apparently they thought that these no-interest loans/free money would just last forever.Partially.The first nail in the coffin was the change in assumptions around output. Before 2023, there was an assumption that more bodies means more output. After the massive X/Twitter layoffs (60-70% headcount culled) with X/Twitter still standing, this assumption was clearly proven false.The second nail was the change in operational metrics. Before 2023, ARR growth was a good enough metric to target. After 2023, FCF positivity became the name of the game. Especially because us investors are demanding this because most funds are reaching the 10 year mark where we need to make our LPs whole, so a path to exit (be it IPO, M&A, or a continuation fund) needs to be communicated.And finally, COVID proved to a large number of companies and industries that 100% WFH and Async for white collar roles does work. But wait, if I can hire Joe in Cary to work async, why can't I hire Jan in Karlin, Prague or Jagmeet in Koramangla, Bangalore? This means I can also enhance FCF positivity while not impacting delivery.Add to that some very, very, very bad hires (most bootcamp grads just can't cut it) at absurdly high salaries and that's why you're seeing the culling that is occurring today.That said, AI tools are powerful, and if you are working on rightsizing an organization, using Claude or Enterprise GPT in workflows helps one person do multiple jobs at once. We now expect PMs to also work as junior program managers, designers, product marketers, customer success managers, and sales engineers and we now expect SWEs to also work as junior program managers, designers, docs writers, and architects. Now I can lay off 10-20% of my GTM, Designers, SWEs, Program Managers, and Docs Writers and still get good enough output.---IMO, if you want to survive in the tech industry in this world, doing the following will probably help maintain your longevity:1. Move to a Tier 1 tech hub like the Bay and NYC. If you get laid off, you will probably find another job in a couple of weeks due to the density of employers.2. Start coming into the office 2-3 days a week. It's harder to layoff someone you have had beers or coffee with. Worst case, they can refer you to their friends companies if you get laid off3. Upskill technically. Learn the fundamentals of AI/ML and MLOPs. Agents are basically a semi-nondeterministic SaaS. Understanding how AI/ML works and understanding their benefits and pitfalls make you a much more valuable hire.4. Upskill professionally. We're not hiring code monkeys for $200K-400K TC. We want Engineers who can communicate business problems into technical requirements. This means also understanding the industry your company is in, how to manage up to leadership, and what are the revenue drivers and cost centers of your employer. Learn how to make a business case for technical issues. If you cannot communicate why refactoring your codebase from Python to Golang would positively impact topline metrics, no one will prioritize it.5. Live lean and save for a rainy day.The reality is the current set of layoffs and work stresses were the norm in the tech industry until 2015-22. We live in a competitive world and complaining on HN does nothing to help your material condition.reply",
      "> After the massive X/Twitter layoffs (60-70% headcount culled) with X/Twitter still standing, this assumption was clearly proven false.Twitter at the same time removed features to have fewer things to support. And didn't implement anything new (or really fix much) for ages. It's not the same service that was standing afterwards. And the \"still standing\" ignores the part where they started serving empty timelines, repeated messages from broken paging, broke 2fa for days, messed up whole continent access, etc. etc. They survived (and still had fewer problems than I expected), but it wasn't smooth at all - hardly a success too.reply",
      "The search functionality has been mostly broken (in several, overlapping ways) for several years nowreply",
      "Most of those were minor, temporary problems that didn't have much impact on casual end users. The app mostly continued working and so to other CEOs this was proof that tech companies could run much leaner. Sure there was some chaos but the basic concept wasn't entirely wrong. And it had long been an open secret in the industry that the majority of Twitter employees were worthless, only there to collect fat salaries and get free massages without doing any productive work.reply",
      "The Twitter layoffs being used as proof of _anything_ is misguided no matter what you're trying to say.If success is losing half their revenue, reverting to revenue numbers from a decade ago, I gotta know what failure looks like. You might argue that the revenue losses aren't correlated to their headcount changes and probably make a good argument, but I mean... It's not a great onereply",
      "Really? Revenue loss was pretty directly tied to Elon replying and supporting some \"jews vs whites\" type posts in Nov 2023.That caused Apple, Coke, and many other large clients to stop advertising.reply"

      "As far as I can tell, all of these attacks require the attacker to already be associated to a victim's network.  Most of these attacks seem similar to ones expected on shared wifi (airports, cafes) that have been known about for a while.  The novel attacks seem to exploit weaknesses in particular router implementations that didn't actually segregate traffic between guest and normal networks.I'm curious if I missed something because that doesn't sound like it allows the worst kind of attacks, e.g. drive-by with no ability to associate to APs without cracking keys.reply",
      "The attacker doesn't need to be connected to the victim's network, only to the same hardware, the hardware's loss of isolation is the unexpected problem.Their University example is pertinent. The victim is an Eduroam user, and the attacker never has any Eduroam credentials, but the same WiFi hardware is serving both eduroam and the local guest provision which will be pretty bare bones, so the attacker uses the means described to start getting packets meant for that Eduroam user.If you only have a single appropriately authenticated WiFi network then the loss of isolation doesn't matter, in the same way that a Sandbox escape in your web browser doesn't matter if you only visit a single trusted web site...reply",
      "I should reinforce this point by saying that it's the default position for \"guest\" networks to be using the same hardware as \"secure\" office wifi and such.reply",
      "I'd further reinforce this by pointing out that this is what the specific term, guest network, means - it's the common name used by router manufacturers to describe an optional feature of serving secondary network from the same hardware, intended for the specific, common use case of serving transient and/or less trusted users.This is in contrast to more genetic, descriptive terms like \"additional network\", \"separate network for guests\", etc.reply",
      "Yeah, that commercial-grade hardware didn't actually isolate at the PHY-MAC layer is a bit surprising.  How would they have working VLANs at the AP?reply",
      "802.11 is kinda poorly designed in this regard, but they do isolate to some degree. I need to read the paper, some claims here have a very strong \"misunderstood or wrong or specific vendor problem\" smell.reply",
      "What about XFinity, which by default shares the wifi you pay for with strangers to create access points around the city?reply",
      "It sounds like this attack would work in that scenario provided the attacker is able to connect to the guest access point.I haven\u2019t paid attention to one in a while but I seem to remember the need to authenticate with the guest network using Xfinity credentials. This at least makes it so attribution might be possible.reply",
      "It looks like both clients must be on the same VLAN for the attack to work. They could be connected on different BSSIDs or even different SSIDs, but they still must be on the same VLAN.reply",
      "If the vulnerability is between layers 1 and 2, wouldn\u2019t that imply that VLAN tagging at layer 2 might not be effective in segregating the traffic?reply"

      "I've got to be honest: my complete skepticism that the maker movement is somehow past tense makes it extremely difficult for me to take this tenuous comparison to LLM coding particularly seriously.The author talks about lowered barriers to prototyping as though they represent a failure state; that's absurd, and it has absolutely nothing to do with whether most people have membership-based maker spaces nearby.Meanwhile, we're in a golden era of tool access. It's now possible for people to buy affordable CNCs, laser cutters and UV printers. I have a freaking pick and place in my home.Also, you can have custom PCBs shipped to you in a week for about $10.Having LLMs available at the same time as all of these tools are rapidly evolving means that anyone with an idea can prototype just about anything. In my worldview, anyone not excited about this either has no original ideas or a cynical agenda.I'd say more but I have to get back to work on my maker projects.reply",
      "> It's now possible for people to buy affordable CNCs, laser cutters and UV printers.Do a lot of people do it?\nMaybe the answer is a tentative yes, given news like the recent case about guns and 3D printing.reply",
      "There are plenty of companies iterating on and selling these products so I assume yes, people are buying them.reply",
      "I disagree with your framing cynicism as an \"agenda\". For the record, I agree that the maker movement hasn't actually ended, and most of your points are correct; however, the idea of LLMs teaching Electronics worries me about as much as people using LLMs to learn Chemistry.A little while ago I had to dissuade someone from learning Chemistry via an LLM, because the advice that they had been given by the LLM would have very literally either blown up the glassware, throwing molten chemicals all over their clothing, or killed them when they tried to taste whatever they were trying to synthesize. There was no consideration of safety protocol, PPE, proper glassware, or correctly dealing with chemical reactions, and nary a mention of a fucking fume hood. NileRed and a few other chemistry youtubers have utterly woeful approaches to laboratory safety (NileRed specifically I have a chip on my shoulder about \u2014 I've seen him practice bad lab work on a number of occasions and violate many of the common safety practices from e.g. Vogel's), but even then they do still take precautions! Let it not be forgotten that safety practices are born through bloodshed. Now we have a whole new wave of people who are excited to learn, and that's great, but one stray hallucination will kill them. I'm sure that the LLM will be more than happy to write an \"Oh I'm sorry, it's my bad that I forgot to tell you to double glove when handling organic mercury!\" but by then it is too late.The idea of someone learning, say, House DIY from an LLM and then sawing through the joists or rewiring their electronics is utterly terrifying to me, quite frankly. Likewise, the idea of someone following an LLM's instructions and then blowing themselves up in a shower of capacitors or chemical glassware is also utterly terrifying to me.Yes, you could do all these things before. But at least the most commonly available learning materials to you were trustworthy and written by experts!reply",
      "> The central promise\u2014that distributed digital fabrication would bring manufacturing back to America, that every city would have micro-factories, that 3D printing would decentralize production\u2014simply didn\u2019t materialize.I never heard that. It didn\u2019t seem like 3D-printing ever showed sings of displacing existing ways of manufacturing at scale, did it? Units per hour and dollars per unit was never its strength. It was always going to be small things (and if anything big grew out of it, those would naturally transition to the more efficient manufacturing at scale).Vibe coding, on the other hand, is competing against hand coding, and for many use cases is considerably more efficient. It\u2019s clearly replacing a lot of hand coding.BTW, I think a lot of people were/are greatly overestimating the value of coding to business success. It\u2019s fungible from a macro perspective, so isn\u2019t a moat by itself. There\u2019s certainly a cost, but hardly the only one if you\u2019re trying to be the next big startup (for that, the high cost of coding was useful \u2014 something to deter potential competitors; you\u2019ll have to make up the difference in some other way now).Also, software is something that already scaled really well in the way businesses need it to \u2014 code written once, whether by human or LLM, can be executed billions of times for almost nothing. Companies will be happy to have a way to press down the budget of a cost center, but the delta won\u2019t make or break that many businesses.As always, the people selling pick-axes during the gold rush will probably do the best.reply",
      "> BTW, I think a lot of people were/are greatly overestimating the value of coding to business success.Fully agree - We already saw dev prices drop significantly when offshore dev shops spun up. I've had great, and also horrible experiences working with devs that could produce lines of code at a fraction of the price of any senior type dev.The higher paid engineers i've worked with are always worth their salary/hourly rate because of the way they approach problems and the solutions they come up with.Agents are great at building out features, i'm not so sure about complex software that grows over time. Unless you know the right questions to ask, the agent misses alot. 80/20 doesn't work for systems that need 100% reliability.reply",
      "I think it's really dependent on the software. And frankly, with the current rate of development, I feel like this continues to shift.No, a non-engineer can't just spin up the next great app. Even with the newest models and a great prompting/testing system, I don't think you can just spit out high quality, maintainable, reliable code. But as a generalist - I'm absolutely able to ship software and tools that solve our business problems.Right now, my company identified an expensive software platform that was set to cost us around $250k/year. People in the industry are raving about it.I've spent 1-2 weeks recreating the core functionality (with a significantly enhanced integration into our CRM and internal analytics) in both a web app and mobile application. And it's gone far smoother than I expected. It's not done - and maybe we'll run into some blocker. But this would have taken me 6 months, at least, to build half as well.I was an AI skeptic for most of last year. It provided value, sure, but it felt like we were plateauing. Slowing down.I'd hoped we might be slowing down to some sort of invisible ceiling. I was faster than ever - but it very much required a level of experience that felt reasonable and fair.It feels different now.I'd say ~70% of my Claude Opus results just work. I tweak the UI and refactor when possible. And it runs into issues I have to solve occasionally. But otherwise? If I'm specific, if I have it brainstorm, then plan, and then implement - then it usually just works.reply",
      "> No, a non-engineer can't just spin up the next great app. Even with the newest models and a great prompting/testing system, I don't think you can just spit out high quality, maintainable, reliable codeI think most engineers vastly overestimate how important high quality, maintainable, reliable code is to product success. Yes, you need an experienced engineer to steer Claude into making good high-quality code. But your customer doesn't see your code, they don't see how many servers you need or how often an on-call engineer is woken up. They just see how well the app meets their needsI predict we will see a lot of domain experts without engineering background spin up incredibly successful apps. Just like the Tea app many of them will crash and burn from poor engineering. But there will also be enough people who've grown wise to this and after reaching some success with their app spend the resources to have others mitigate all the unknown-to-them issuesreply",
      "> The higher paid engineers i've worked with are always worth their salary/hourly rate because of the way they approach problems and the solutions they come up with.I'm honestly just happy at the moment, because our two junior admins/platform engineers have made some really good points to me in preparation for their annual reviews.One now completed his own bigger terraform project, with the great praise of \"That looks super easy to maintain and use\" from the other more experienced engineers. He figured: \"It's weird, you actually end up thinking and poking at a problem for a week or two, and then it actually folds into a very small amount of code. And sure, Copilot helped a bit with some boilerplate, but that was only after figuring out how to structure and hold it\".The other is working on getting a grip on running the big temperamental beast called PostgreSQL. She was recently a bit frustrated. \"How can it be so hard to configure a simple number! It's so easy to set it in ansible and roll it out, but to find the right value, you gotta search the entire universe from top to bottom and then the answer is <maybe>. AAaah I gotta yell at a team\". She's on a good way to become a great DBA.> Agents are great at building out features, i'm not so sure about complex software that grows over time. Unless you know the right questions to ask, the agent misses alot. 80/20 doesn't work for systems that need 100% reliability.Or if it's very structured and testable. For example, we're seeing great value in rebuilding a Grafana instance from manually managed to scripted dashboards. After a bit of scaffolding, some style instructions and a few example systems, you can just chuck it a description and a few queries, it just goes to successful work and just needs a little tweaking afterwards.Similar, we're now converting a few remnants of our old config management to the new one using AI agents. Setup a good test suite first, then throw old code and examples of how the new config management does it into the context and modern models do that well. At that point, just rebuilding the system once is better than year-long deprecation plans with undecided stakeholders as mobile as a pet ferret that doesn't want to.It's really not the code holding the platform together, it's the team and the experiences and behaviors of people.reply",

This part is about checking how Insyde fixed the vulnerability and if it's possible to bypass their fixes.It is always interesting to see how a vulnerability with a massive supply chain impact gets fixed by different OEMs, and how fast they could distribute the fix across their fleets.There been 10 days since the embargo end, and so far the only OEM who successfully delivered BIOS updates with fixes for Hydroph0bia is Dell.Lenovo confirmed they are vulnerable, but will deliver the fixes not earlier than 2025-07-30 (later for some models).Framework confirmed they are vulnerable, but provided no time estimates.All other affected vendors (Acer, Fujitsu, HP, etc.) haven't published anything relevant yet, neither a security advisory, nor fixed BIOS updates.Let's do some more reverse engineering and see how Insyde fixed th"

      "I find it easier to understand in terms of the Unix syscall API. `2>&1` literally translates as `dup2(1, 2)`, and indeed that's exactly how it works. In the classic unix shells that's all that happens; in more modern shells there may be some additional internal bookkeeping to remember state. Understanding it as dup2 means it's easier to understand how successive redirections work, though you also have to know that redirection operators are executed left-to-right, and traditionally each operator was executed immediately as it was parsed, left-to-right. The pipe operator works similarly, though it's a combination of fork and dup'ing, with the command being forked off from the shell as a child before processing the remainder of the line.Though, understanding it this way makes the direction of the angled bracket a little odd; at least for me it's more natural to understand dup2(2, 1) as 2<1, as in make fd 2 a duplicate of fd 1, but in terms of abstract I/O semantics that would be misleading.reply",
      "Another fun consequence of this is that you can initialize otherwise-unset file descriptors this way:    $ cat foo.sh\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n    >&1 echo \"will print on stdout\"\n    >&2 echo \"will print on stderr\"\n    >&3 echo \"will print on fd 3\"\n\n    $ ./foo.sh 3>&1 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null\n    will print on fd 3\n\nIt's a trick you can use if you've got a super chatty script or set of scripts, you want to silence or slurp up all of their output, but you still want to allow some mechanism for printing directly to the terminal.The danger is that if you don't open it before running the script, you'll get an error:    $ ./foo.sh\n    will print on stdout\n    will print on stderr\n    ./foo.sh: line 5: 3: Bad file descriptorreply",

I wanted my build scripts to be able to only show the output from the build system if building failed (and there might have been multiple build system invocations leading to that failure). I also wanted the second level to be able to log progress messages that were shown to the user immediately on stdout.    Level 1: create fd=3, capture fd 1/2 (done in one place at the top-level)\n    Level 2: log progress messages to fd=3 so the user knows what's happening\n    Level 3: original build system, will log to fd 1/2, but will be captured\n\nIt was janky and it's not a project I have a need for anymore, but it was technically a real world use case.reply",

I've actually been a longtime Gecko/Firefox user myself, so this one stings a bit.The short answer: Firefox doesn't support the File System Access API (https://caniuse.com/?search=File+System+Access+API).We made a deliberate decision to go client-first. Video editing happens entirely in your browser without us uploading your entire footage on our end. No bandwidth costs for you, no storing your raw video on our servers. The File System Access API is what makes that possible, and unfortunately Firefox just doesn't have it yet.It's not a forever thing though. For cloud-based projects where files live on our end anyway, Firefox support is very much on the roadmap. But for the local-first editing flow, our hands are a bit tied until Mozilla ships it.Hope that makes sense, and fingers crossed Firefox adds support soon!reply",

Even doing something as simple as a sortable-and-filterable table requires thousands of lines of JS when it should've just been a few extra attributes on an HTML6 <table> by now.Back in the day with PHP things were much more understandable, it's somehow gotten objectively worse. And now, most desktop apps are their own contained browser. Somehow worse than Windows 98 .hta apps, too; where at least the system browser served a local app up, now we have ten copies of Electron running, bringing my relatively new Macbook to a crawl.

      "The Australian examples are very odd - the pictures of our general purpose outlets are normal (figures 1 and 3 when you click on Australia), but most of the rest is unusual and either fairly or very rare.For example the plug shown on the main page is very non-typical - it's a re-wireable one which you very rarely see (because it's generally only if a plug has been damaged and had to be replaced) - almost all the plugs normal people will ever use in Australia will actually be fully moulded.Secondly it's right-angle, which is not incredibly rare but not the default - normally you'd only see that on some power-boards (what the US I think calls 'power strips') or some extension cables. Appliances usually have straight plugs, the right angle one you do see on them sometimes but not as much (maybe 5-10%).When you click in to the Australia page, the back side of the plug is also shown as piggy-back which is also quite rare (usually only on extension cords - such as in figure 10, that one is fairly normal).Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 and 9 are also things you'll almost never see (it does say in the case of figure 9 that a rewirable piggy-back as shown is now disallowed by our wiring standards).Some of the example pictures would be better to be changed to something more normal, and the detailed page could probably be broken up into typical, specialist and rare/obsolete sections because it's confusing having it all together.reply",
      "It's an interesting point of view, conversely, as an Australian of some decades, they all look fairly normal to me and a subset of a greater spectrum I'm also familiar with.Right angle plugs may well be less common (in your experience) but they're essential for, say, getting power from the wall to a breakout strip (for TV + games consoles, NAS, media box, etc. corners) when the wall plug is behind a low cabinet / cupboard.In any case it's a museum, a catalog, intended to show a range of things that do exist, even if a good number may not encounter them frequently.reply",
      "Yeah I'm not saying they are unheard of - for example I've done a lot of stuff in AV and almost every single extension cord you use in that world will be a piggy-back right angle (always moulded though because they have to be test-and-tagged so a reputable certifier won't pass them).Just that not having any pictures of the plug that you see on 90% of cords in normal use is an odd choice.reply",
      "They used to be more common in the pre power board age (piggy backs, and screw terminal - they were very common back in the day), I can't see a date anywhere on the page. 5-8 are more specialist.reply",
      "I was thinking about this and came to conclusion that the only correct type is UK style socket because it has fuse.In our houses, there are circuit breakers. They don't protect you or devices, they can only protect wires in the wall, those who installed the wires knew how much current they can take and installed appropriate circuit breakers.When you plug the plug in the wall socket, the circuit breaker has no idea what you plugged in so it cannot protect it, so there has to be a fuse in the plug, like in the UK plug. Whoever chose the wires for this device choose appropriate fuse.There is one more case possible, the wire is not permanently attached to the device but via another socket, for example C14 socket like in PC. In that case manufacturer of the PC should know what kind of currents it is capable of handling and should put fuse inside it.Now everything is protected (at least for over-current, if you touch live and neutral with two hands, 30mA through heart is enough to kill you but that's something that cannot be avoided, not even GFCI can do it).reply",
      "I think it's overrated, plenty of equipment has some kind of protection internally anyway.My country has never had a fuse in the plug and we generally have a very safe electrical system (much stricter earthing rules than the US for example). Adding an extra fuse doesn't really seem to add much, it really doesn't seem to be any kind of significant risk.reply",
      "Fuses are very imprecise devices. A 10A fuse won't really protect you from an overload of 20A. It could take an hour to blow or not blow at all. Both the 10A and 20A fuse will protect you from 1000A short circuits.reply",

      "Almost always when I'm in a country that does not have European (CEE) plugs and sockets, I feel uncomfortable. All CEE combinations have very solid touch protection. It's almost impossible to touch a metal pin of a plug when it's so close to the socket that it might have contact.\nWhen I the see the \"flat\" style sockets plus the full-metal pins I wonder if it's just a bad feeling or if way more people gets accidentally electrocuted with that kind of plugs/socket than with our CEE types.reply",
      "Despite being fairly careless when handling them, I've managed a fair few decades without once shocking myself.With that being said, I would be delighted with CEE, BS or almost anything other than NEMA anything.The 120v plugs aren't the worst thing since they usually have some good gripping points, and the 50 amp plugs usually have a handle on the back, but the 30 amp plugs typically have no finger indentation at all for gripping and I feel like my fingers are going to slip over and around every time I pull one out.reply"

      "I miss the whole Palm ecosystem.I have noted many times that I had a slab phone with full screen color icon grid general purpose os with internet and countless 3rd party apps for every conceivable purpose,... 7 full years before the iphone. 8 years before the iphone had 3rd party apps.And it wasn't Android it was a Samsung SPH-i300 running PalmOS.It was great that there was not really much of an app store, you got apps individually more or less like desktop os apps. There might have been app stores that collected apps but I don't remember ever using any.I had apps for everything the same as today. Even though the screen was only like 160x240 and the internet was 14.4k, I had browser & email of course, but also ssh, irc, I even had a vnc client! Audible.com player, countless random things like a netmask calculator, resistor color code app, a few different generic db apps where you design your own fields and input/display screens etc. 3rd party phone dialer that integrated the contacts db. I must be forgetting a hundred other things.The OS wasn't open source but at least the apps could be, so pretty much like windows & mac.All in all I'd prefer Android where the entire system is open, except Google has somehow managed to make the real world life with Android less open than PalmOS was, even though PalmOS wasn't open source and I think even the development system wasn't free either.I think the \"somehow\" is the extremely integrated app store. Previously, if there were any app stores, they didn't really matter. It didn't hurt you not to be in them because hardly any users were either. But today it's basically just a technicality to say that you don't have to be in the official app store, and not even theoretically/technically true in many cases.reply",
      "> I think even the development system wasn't free either.Metrowerks CodeWarrior was the original development system for PalmOS and was indeed not free (in either sense).However a bunch of enthusiasts cobbled together some free development tools: the main parts were adapting the GCC and binutils m68k targets to PalmOS's constrained PIC runtime environment (it was constrained even by m68k standards); a tool to convert the resulting COFF or ELF executable to PalmOS's .prc database format; and a text-based resource compiler for generating UI elements using its own home-grown description language to express what CodeWarrior users were using a graphical UI editor to make.That mostly still exists as it was back in the PalmOS days at <https://prc-tools.sourceforge.net>.

      "Agreed, independent of where the terminology came from, I think if you're trying to promote healthier engagement both for yourself and others using this extension, then not having such adversarial names it's probably a good idea. It should just end up being a sort of web of trust to help you decide what's worth engaging with \u2014 and sometimes perfectly valid people that you're not actually enemies with or anything just aren't worth your time engaging with because of fundamental axiological or positional differences.reply",
