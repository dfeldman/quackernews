    "first_paragraph": "In Catalyst, a WebAssembly implementation of the OpenSmalltalk virtual machine, there are three linguistic levels in play: Smalltalk, JavaScript (JS), and WebAssembly (WASM). Smalltalk is our primary language, JS is the coordinating language of the hosting environment (a web browser), and WASM is a high-performance runtime instruction set to which we can compile any other language. In a previous article, I wrote about automatic translation of JS to WASM, as a temporary way of translating the SqueakJS virtual machine to WASM. That benefits from a proven JS starting point for the relatively large codebase of the virtual machine. When translating individual Smalltalk compiled methods for \u201cjust-in-time\u201d optimization, however, it makes more sense to translate from Smalltalk to WASM directly."
