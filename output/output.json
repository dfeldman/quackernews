      "From: James Guthrie interview> Another piece that worked better than expected was the telephone operator. Roger was keen to illustrate the personal disconnect of being on the road. We were in L.A. at Producer\u2019s Workshop so I phoned my neighbour, Chris Fitzmorris in London. He had the keys to my flat and I asked him to go there and said that I would call him through an operator. \u201cNo matter how many times I call\u201d, I said, \u201cjust pick up the phone, say \u2018Hello\u2019, let the operator speak and then hang up\u201d. I placed a telephone in a soundproof area, got on to an extension phone and started recording to \u00bc\u201d tape. It took a couple of operators \u2013 the first 2 were a bit abrupt, but the 3rd was perfect. I told her that I wanted to make a collect call to Mrs. Floyd. \u201cWho\u2019s calling?\u201d she asked. \u201cMr. Floyd\u201d, I replied. Chris\u2019s timing was terrific, over and over he would hang up just at the right moment and she became genuinely concerned. \u201cIs there supposed to be someone there besides your wife?\u201d I was playing her along saying things like \u201cNo! I don\u2019t know who that is!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d and she would try the call again. Unwittingly, she was helping to tell the story. Afterwards I went through the \u00bc\u201d and edited my voice out, just leaving her and Chris. I sometimes wonder if she ever heard herself on the record.Source: https://www.brain-damage.co.uk/other-related-interviews/jame...\n \nreply",
      "> Initially, I was shocked at how slowly everything moved! I was used to working really quickly when producing and engineering albums. Suddenly it was like the brakes were on and often it was difficult to get the momentum going. Eventually, I adapted to the Floyd pace. One of the great things about working with this band is that you are allowed time to be creative, to pursue an idea even if it takes some time. The Floyd had a production deal to make their records and the record label never heard anything until it was done. The record was made purely and only by the people in the studio.The creative freedom without commercial intervention - this is very cool. I can almost hear it in The Wall - how grand and elongated the songs are.What a great interview. Thank you for linking\n \nreply",

IMO the problem here is that AMD still doesn't seem to think that GPGPU compute is a thing. They don't seem to understand the idea that someone might want to use their graphics cards to multiply matricies independently of a graphics pipeline. All the features CUDA supports are irrelevant compared to the fact that AMD can't handle GEMM performantly out of the box. In my experience it just can't do it, back in the day my attempts to multiply matrices would crash drivers.

      "An interesting experience I had was deciding to enter my novel into a contest, and discovering the contest had strict requirements on how long each chapter had to be. They could have set a total word count requirement but instead they wanted X chapters of Y-Z total words.It was interesting to re-edit my novel to fit this format because in some cases, it created this awful impetus to 'pad out' key moments or the flow of the plot in order to hit the Y mark, and in other cases I had 'too much' and might need to cut an interesting moment short or trivialize what someone was saying to fit it all into a 'chapter'.Where before, I had just written more or less how much I thought needed to be on the page, which meant I had some chapters that were 500 words long and some that were 2000 words long.In the end I think it improved the work in a few places just through the process of being edited again (for the 10th or 11th time - try writing a novel sometime, that part is fun, editing it all over and over is the hard part), but overall having new conventions enforced on it was just a lot of busywork, and the work breathed much better when allowed to be concise at the right moments and verbose at others.A good lesson for me in terms of 'not all constraints are useful ones', since I'm used to thinking of constraints as something that enables creativity and productivity.\n \nreply",

The next chapter is one paragraph from the protagonist of the series - an ubermensch-type fellow that is a journal log or something that goes \"Encountered light resistance at $ambush_site\". Pretty successful show don't tell there of the skill/strength disparity. The next chapter goes to a different POV. I enjoyed that clever trick with the chapter lengths.\n \nreply"

So first of all I would like to wish you a Merry Christmas! As the days melt into each other and us developers find some free time and venture into Advent of Code and similar shenanigans, I stumbled upon JBang which allows us to run Java (or Kotlin / Groovy) programs with one command. Officially JRuby is not supported, though I was intrigued.I was a Ruby developer a while back (these days it's mostly TypeScript, and if I get lucky some Kotlin) but being a Java developer from around 2002-2010, I always found JRuby to be an exciting technology. Simply put, it holds the promise of JVM performance and the productivity and pleasure of developing in Ruby (Kotlin is the only language that comes close to this). I will not go into the details of JRuby but I always wanted to use something like Javalin with JRuby. How"

      "I\u2019ve worked in the pharma industry for a long time, particularly focusing on clinical trials, and I couldn\u2019t agree more with the key points of this article. Clinical trials are still a key bottleneck, with patient recruitment being one of the biggest challenges.It\u2019s crucial to make clinical trials more accessible, understandable, and streamlined for the entire ecosystem (patients and HCPs).This is exactly the mission of PatLynk: https://patlynk.com. It provides efficient patient / trial matching leveraging different sources of data and making the process seamless, finally !\n \nreply",
      "I worked in this space for ~10 years and learned a lot.In 2011, the bootstrapped startup I was at built the first COTS trial site electronic document exchange portal.  Up until then, trial teams would use a mish mash of shipping paper, fax, FTP, E-mail, etc.Our product was a finalist for the Transcelerate Shared Investigator Portal (SIP) project to unify this process on one platform.I saw the internal workings of IT teams in many large pharmas and fought to modernize the internal workings of our own team.I say all this as preface.  The industry as a whole is highly political, incredibly conservative when it comes to tech, and has high barriers to innovation.I use this term \"political\" broadly to cover an array of issues I observed.  One of which is that there's a lot of jostling for influence because that's how consultants and vendors make money.  A lot of folks with influence are long-time industry veterans with domain expertise, but no technical prowess paired with it.  There are a lot of parallels to politics in that highly experienced individuals who carry weight in the industry will leave and form/join a consultancy (a la lobbying) and use that to extract rent.  It is then in their interest that processes remain cumbersome and unwieldy so they can come in with their expertise and \"streamline\" it.  Certainly, if there were technical standards and standard processes and open tools, lots of vendors and highly paid consultants would be out of a paycheck!In the end of the Transcelerate SIP selection process, Veeva submitted a non-existent product (at the time) that they never delivered to SIP and ultimately Cognizant (the consultancy running the selection) built their own because of course!  Millions of dollars in recurring revenue were on the line!Lots of good ideas have come and gone because the entrenched interests in this space extract rent from the friction.  One working group I was a part of was iterating a spec as a spreadsheet instead of a technical format like a standard API...One point I particularly disagree with the OP is CT.gov.  It is fine, IMO, because it is meant for industry and not laypersons.  It has an excellent API[0] and there are plenty of third parties that build consumer-facing apps for trial matching. For example, I built a really basic one using LLMs to match natural language criteria to clinical trials and emails you when a matching trial pops up in the change feed[1].  The CTTI working group also provides a Postgres dump of the change feed as a consolidated database[2] (I write about how to use it here: https://charliedigital.com/2021/05/24/the-best-worst-kept-se...).  The main problem with CT.gov right now is that it lacks a bit in data quality standards. There's a lot of variation in completeness of data dependent on country of origin and even between companies.The lack of technical standards in the industry really hurts innovation.  For example, clinical trial protocols should arguably be a standard technical template.  The FDA has done some work in this area[2], but industry has largely not adopted it.  You can find public protocols attached to some trials on CT.gov, but every company has a different structure.  Yet it is this document that underpins the design and execution of the trial (on top of being hard for trial sites to adapt between different sponsors).The source of change may ultimately originate from private equity.  The trial site side is seeing a consolidation with sites being acquired by PE because they realize they can extract rent[4].  One positive outcome is likely more standardization and technology solutions installed by PE to actually streamline ops in an attempt to take on more clinical trials.  Centralization and separation of many of the functions in a clinical trial in this type of structure may also yield improvements on the execution side.[0] https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api#extapi[1] https://zeeq.ai[2] https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/[3] https://osp.od.nih.gov/policies/clinical-research#tab1/[4] https://www.fiercebiotech.com/cro/private-equity-invests-tri...\n \nreply"

      "Yep - there's already a working group in the Keycloak community aligning with various standards. In our case, the Cybersecurity Fabric is the component that handles ownership, secure portability and revocation.\n \nreply",
      "> keys are split across a decentralized network [...] so no one ever holds the full key. [...] in a breach there\u2019s no unchecked authority exposed.so shamir secret sharing, which requires users to coordinate to unlock vaults and get tokens, and if one key gets compromised, the attacker still has to solve the coordination problem with a threshold of other key holders. that's within the realm of things we trust today.there are a few black boxes and flags in the description that would ordinarily get hammered pretty hard by security people who have to make decisions about this stuff, but more charitably:I'm guessing the fabric is probably a ledger that users subscribe to and that's how it becomes decentralized? imagining how this works, tidecloak adds its fabric as a party to each users (ephemeral?) SSS vault, where the fabric would usually be a centralized dependency, but if the number of SSS parties on the user vault is 3 or greater, your fabric key also requires coordination with another party to participate in unlocking the vault, so it can only participate optionally in an SSS vault decrypt- and probably just for something like a change/recovery operation?(I'm speculating a bit to draw out some concrete corrections, as the some of those term usages in the description would draw heavy flak in a technical sales or architecture meeting.)\n \nreply",
      "So many great points raised here! Allow me to try and cover as much as possible. In a way, you can say TideCloak uses the Fabric as a key vault for (1) each user's authority (2) its own central authority. This way, even when TideCloak is completely breached, neither its users or own authority and authorization can be compromised. For simplicity, let's call those \"authorities\" keys. Whenever use of those keys is required, TideCloak makes a request to the Fabric, and as a swarm, the Fabric manifest that request in a multi-party fashion (a few steps up from standard SSS) and replies with the required artefact (access token, ephemeral decryption keys, signed consent, etc) in such a way that the secret keys are never assembled or exposed. Tidecloak itself, therefore, holds no user credentials or root certificate, so a breach of the IAM or an administrator is far less consequential. That API request is, for all intents and purposes, the coordination you mentioned. The Fabric is a \"centralized dependency\" as much as DNS is, or the internet. Yes, without the Fabric, those vaults are inaccessible \u2013 but the Fabric is robustly highly-available and resilient. Regarding the potential flak you mentioned, if you meant from describing the technology in high level terms, noted! If you meant because the approach we\u2019re proposing introduces (and requires) a shift from today's paradigm, I think you\u2019re devastatingly spot on. We\u2019re expecting this concept to attract pushback, because it demands relinquishing centralized ownership of those authorities to some \"ineffable\" vault that no one can access. It's a big ask \u2013 but, it's also the only guarantee that if no one can access it, it can never be compromised. In my mind I\u2019d liken it to the objection \"on-demand hosted\" architecture attracted in the early 2000s, which later became the ubiquitous \"cloud\". We can't avoid the resistance to change other than by continuing to push forward with the help of the significant academic scrutiny we\u2019ve received to date, and the tailwind of a community interested in advancing it through participation.\n \nreply",
      "Thank you. The challenge here is how to trust it. I think leading with stating that this is a paradigm shift is key, and then it's important to show how it pivots from first principles. Right now, the description has what appear to be proprietary product terms (fabric, ineffable, etc) where ordinarily there would be some more familiar terms of art from cryptography.How much of this is net new, and are we asking people to suspend their disbelief?\n \nreply"

      "A friend of mine co-runs a semi-popular semi-niche news site (for now more than a decade), and complains that recently traffic rose with bots masquerading as humans.How would they know? Well, because Google, in its omniscience, started to downrank them for faking views with bots (which they do not do): it shows bot percentage in traffic stats, and it skyrocketed relative to non-bot traffic (which is now less than 50%) as they started to fall from the front page (feeding the vicious circle). Presumably, Google does not know or care it is a bot when it serves ads, but correlates it later with the metrics it has from other sites that use GA or ads.Or, perhaps, Google spots the same anomalies that my friend (an old school sysadmin who pays attention to logs) did, such as the increase of traffic along with never seen before popularity among iPhone users (who are so tech savvy that they apparently do not require CSS), or users from Dallas who famously love their QQBrowser. I\u2019m not going to list all telltale signs as the crowd here is too hype on LLMs (which is our going theory so far, it is very timely), but my friend hopes Google learns them quickly.These newcomers usually fake UA, use inconspicuous Western IPs (requests from Baidu/Tencent data center ranges do sign themselves as bots in UA), ignore robots.txt and load many pages very quickly.I would assume bot traffic increase would apply to feeds, since they are of as much use for LLM training purposes.My friend does not actually engage in stringent filtering like Rachel does, but I wonder how soon it becomes actually infeasible to operate a website with actual original content (which my friend co-writes) without either that or resorting to Cloudflare or the like for protection because of the domination of these creepy-crawlies.Edit: Google already downranked them, not threatened to downrank. Also, traffic rose but did not skyrocket, but relative amount of bot traffic skyrocketed. (Presumably without downranking the traffic would actually skyrocket.)\n \nreply",

Change the cost equation so that it costs them more than it costs you.You're thinking of it wrong, the seeds of the thinking error are here: \"I wonder how soon it becomes actually infeasible to operate a website with actual original content\".Bots want original content, no? So what's the problem with giving it to them? But that's the issue, isn't it? Clearly, contextually, what you should be saying is \"I wonder how soon it becomes actually infeasible to operate a website for actual organic users\" or something like that. But phrased that way, I'm not sure a CDN helps (I'm not sure they don't suffer false positives which interfere with organic traffic when they intermediate, more security theater because hangings and executions look good, look at the numbers of enemy dead).Take measures that any damn fool (or at least your desired audience) can recognize.Reading for comprehension, I think Rachel understands this.\n \nreply",

      "The idea is that bots are inflexible to deviations from accepted norms and can't actually \"see\" rendered browser content. So if your generic 404, 403 error pages return a 200 status instead, with invisible links to other non accessible pages.

It's basically how a lobster trap works if you want a visual metaphor.The important part here is to do this chaotically. The worst sites to scrape are buggy ones.

      "This is very cool! I\u2019ve wanted something like CodeMic for a long time.Back when I was at Twitter, we used Review Board for code reviews (this was in 2009, before GH was a thing for most companies). It was tough to thoughtfully review large branches, especially for parts of the codebase that I wasn\u2019t familiar with. I remember thinking, if I could somehow record the development process for a PR I was reviewing, it would be easier to understand what the submitter was trying to accomplish and how they went about doing so. I found myself more so reviewing code style instead of functionality, architecture, or design.I watched most of the intro video, but didn\u2019t go deeper on the site. Does CM integrate easily into the code review/PR process? I suppose I could just attach a link in any PR description?Great work!\n \nreply",
      "Thanks a lot! I have thought about it being useful for learning, for fun, as a new kind of documentation, or even for onboarding new hires but the use case for code review didn't occur to me. That's great. I can think of 3 ways to share sessions:- attach a link as you said- once the web player is ready, it could perhaps be integrated into the code review tool. It'll be like embedding a youtube video- the entire recorded session can be exported as a zip file and attached to the PR or shared privately\n \nreply",
      "The idea and arguments behind it impressive, but I'm stuggle to understand couple of things:- why is Doom gameplay is shown alongside recording of someone coding a player logic? Was it the developer recording the screen and narrating, explaining what he means with that line of code?- I see appeal to \"relive\" your own code (so you have a mental model of problem domain and the code base in your head). But how is it supposed to work for onboarding new developers? Even in the code examples in video, how does one understands the thinking - like, what are those magic constants (dist == 200), for example? Is there audio narration or what?Also, I believe that next year will be the true explosion of agentic code editors, so how is it gonna work here? Is it going to capture prompts in Cursor/Windsurf? Will it even be easy to follow what changes AI assistant made in bulk in multiple files. Since I switched to Windsurf, the speed and workflow is so dramatically different from that old-school person typing coding workflow.\n \nreply",
      "Yes the Doom gameplay was narrated. It was showing how the changes to the code affected the gameplay.The main idea is to create narrated guides through the code. It can be audio only or mixed with video and images.CodeMic basically records changes made to the code (as well as scroll, selections etc). It doesn't really care if the changes are made by the developer or the AI assistant. I think it would be the job of the narrator to explain why the files suddenly changed.I'm excited to see what kind of content developers will create on CodeMic but personally, my inspiration is 3Blue1Brown. That is to say, not so much live recording of a 3 hour long programming session but instead shorter, more polished and well planned content. I suppose time will tell which will be more popular.\n \nreply",

Also, I'm sure some prefer to write than talk so once that feature is in place, we can have any mix of audio, video, or markdown guides.\n \nreply",
