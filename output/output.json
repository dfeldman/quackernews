You could do basically everything that you could do in languages like C/C++, but in most cases, you could churn out code quicker. This even extended to DirectX/Direct3D! For Web pages? ASP Classic.The tl;dr is that I really wish that ease of development were prioritized along with everything else. One of the reasons I like Ruby is the elegance of the language and ease of using it.Note that I've been using it since the mid 2000s or so, but not exclusively (both it and VB6 defined my career, however).

This has many important properties that make music easier to read and reason about, such as allowing written music to specify \"all the E's, A's, and B's are flat\" once at the start of the piece instead of having to clutter the page with redundant sharps or flats everywhere.)reply",
      "The device is fantastic indeed!Regarding flats and sharps: one could ignore the Pythagorean stuff and go full well-tempered dodecaphonic, thinking purely in terms of semitones in the intervals. This toy sort of nudges towards this. It would be fun to add 12 small LEDs along the faders, and show the number of semitones with them, relative to the previous fader's position.On one hand, the fact that the same sound can be named A# and Bb may be puzzling for a kid (they could differ on a violin, I suppose); OTOH if the kid later learns formal music notation, this becomes helpful, so your comment holds.reply",
      "> On one hand, the fact that the same sound can be named A# and Bb may be puzzling for a kidI think that, given the toy is (currently) diatonic, and doesn't really have any ability to visualize the chromatic scale (like a piano keyboard does), using the formally correct note names is more intuitive. That way, only the accidentals change when you change modes (\"when I change it to C minor, the B becomes a Bb\"). This naturally teaches a simple and correct mental model: \"the slider chooses a letter and pushing the orange knob makes letters flat or sharp\".If you only ever use sharps instead of sticking to the correct notation, then the notes change inconsistently between different keys (\"changing from C major to C minor turns the B into an A#, but changing from C# major to C# minor changes the F into an E\"). This is incomprehensible unless you've already memorized the piano keyboard layout.The OP's choice of restricting to the diatonic scale seems sensible to me -- it helps the kid learn the vocabulary of Western music (if that's your goal!) and it benefits the parents as well by making it hard to create something that sounds bad.reply",

Unix v7 was portable enough and the PDP-11 architecturally similar enough to x86 that almost all the code works without change.  (Many of the changes from v6 to v7 were to make Unix more portable; it was already running on at least 4 different architectures by 1980.)I wonder if the obscurity is because the x86 v7 source was an archive inside an archive?  Seems a minor thing but not having it to browse online is likely to be an off-ramp for most.https://www.nordier.com/v7x86/v7x86-0.8a-all.tar.xz has releases/v7x86-0.8a.tar.bz2  (you'll want to use a -C prefix it explodes in the current directory).   Source is in usr/sys and usr/src like normal for v7 Unix.And yes, your modern Linux system's GNU tar is reading the ancient v7 tar format just fine.

Awful tests that were unmaintainable and next to useless (too much mocking, testing that the code \u201cworks the way it was written\u201d, etc.). Writing a useful test suite is one of the most important parts of a codebase and requires careful deliberate thought. Without deep understanding of business logic (which takes time and is often lost after the initial devs move on) you\u2019re not gonna get great tests.To be fair to AI, we hired a \u201cconsultant\u201d that also got us this same level of testing so it\u2019s not like there is a high bar out there.

      "> I find coding agents can produce very high quality tests if and only if you give them detailed guidance and good starting examples.I find this to be true for all AI coding, period.

If I am not sure how it should work and give more vague instructions, things don't work so well.reply",
      "Yeah, same. Usually I'll ask the agent for a few alternatives, to make sure I'm not missing something, but the solution I wanted tends to be the best one. I also get into a lot of me saying \"hm, why are you doing it that way?\" \"Oh yeah, that isn't actually going to work, sorry\".reply",

If this cannot be made succinct, or if there is ambiguity in the business case, the test case should not be generated.\"reply",
      "I've had reasonable success from doing something like this, though it is my current opinion that it's better to write the first few tests yourself to establish a clear pattern and approach.  However, if you don't care that much (which is common with side projects):Starting point:  small-ish codebase, no tests at all:    > I'd like to add a test suite to this project.  It should follow language best practices.  It should use standard tooling as much as possible.  It should focus on testing real code, not on mocking/stubbing, though mocking/stubbing is ok for things like third party services and parts of the code base that can't reasonably run in a test environment.  What are some design options we could do? Don't write any code yet, present me the best of the options and let me guide you.\n    > Ok, I like option number two.  Put the basic framework in place and write a couple of dummy tests.\n    > Great, let's go ahead and write some real tests for module X.\n\nand etc.  For a project with an existing and mature test suite, it's much easier:    > I'd like to add a test (or improve a test) for module X.  Use the existing helpers and if you find yourself needing new helpers, ask me about the approach before implementing\n\nI've also found it helpful to put things in AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md about tests and my preferences, such as:    - Tests should not rely on sleep to avoid timing issues.  If there is a timing issue, present me with options and let me guide you\n    - Tests should not follow an extreme DRY pattern, favor human readability over absolute DRYness\n    - Tests should focus on testing real code, not on mocking/stubbing, though mocking/stubbing is ok for things like third party services and parts of the code base that can't reasonably run in a test environment.\n    - Tests should not make assumptions about the current running state of the environment, nor should they do anything that isn't cleaned up before completing the test to avoid polluting future tests\n\nI do want to stress that every project and framework is different and has different needs.  As you discover the AI doing something you don't like, add it to the prompts or the AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md.

      "I've think they're also much better at creating useful end to end UI tests than unit or integration tests, but unfortunately those are hard to create self contained environments for without bringing a lot of baggage and docker containers, which not all agent VMs might support yet. Getting headless QT running was a pain too, but now ChatGPT Codex can see screenshots and show them in chat (Claude Code can't show them in the chat for some reason) and it's been generating much better end to end tests than I've seen for unit/integration.reply"

      "Reminds me of a funny WWII story:Kenneth Arrow and his statisticians found that their long-range forecasts were no better than numbers pulled out of a hat. The forecasters agreed and asked their superiors to be relieved of this duty. The reply was: \"The Commanding General is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However he needs them for planning purposes.\"reply",
      "I think it was a stats class where I learned this, but as it turns out bad weather is less common than good weather.  To be a fairly accurate weather person, you merely need to say \"there will be no precipitation\" and you'll be right like 90% of the time anywhere on earth.What makes that funny is that historically, weather forecasters have been less than 90% accurate.Now, I will say that today's weather models are pretty dang amazing.  The 10 day forecast rarely wrong for me.reply",
      "I think this depends a lot on the region. I find that forecast quality differs widely from region to region. My guess is that it's a matter of (1) some regions have less advanced models available to them and (2) some regions have fundamentally more complex and unpredictable weather patterns.Concrete if anecdotal example: weather forecast in SF are fairly accurate but the weather patterns are also simple to predict with the Pacific High and the simpler high level mechanics at play. Weather forecasts in Seoul are quite often completely wrong, but the weather patterns are also much more dynamics at a macro level with competing large systems in China/Gobi desert and the Western Pacific.I'm not a meteorologist, just a sailor who likes to look at weather.reply",
      "I regularly encounter days when today's forecast is wrong and even in conflict with the current situation.E.g. the weather app tells me there's a drizzle all day and currently and yet it's entirely dry. The opposite happens too.Days of rain often shift in increments of days one or two days before as well.I'd say it's location specific how accurate predictions are.reply",

      "There is a fairly compelling argument that divination in the ancient world was not a useless waste of time, as is commonly assumed, but that having either a process or a person that can make essentially random choices for them allowed  people to make hard, consequential decisions where they might otherwise be paralyzed, especially when the penalty for not acting was worse than making a mistake.reply",
      "IIRC, the value of randomness went even further than that. I think it was in the allocation of land for rice paddies. I-ching was used to decide if any given farmer's land was to be used that year or something like that. The benefit wasn't divination selecting better land, but by way of random selection, gave an impersonal excuse to leave fields unplanted some years, which is beneficial in the long term to overall yield.reply",
      "Additionally, what has been the correct choice five years in a row might be catastrophically wrong in the sixth year. We need some randomness injected into our behaviour so that some people are always making \"suboptimal\" choices, to stop everyone from crowding into one local maximum and then getting swept away when the rare but inevitable flood comes along.reply",
      "Never thought of that. Probably a bit too generous given that it could be just as well waste of time and resources, nevermind the bias of the voodoo doctor. Most of it was just weirdly provided therapy I suppose to relieve stress.But it is funny that humans put a great lot of weight on social contracts and being given explicit orders, maybe even publicly, must help pursuing action instead of rumination.

      "Fun fact: I\u2019m working on turning ESPectre into a Wi\u2011Fi Theremin (the musical instrument you play by moving your hands near an antenna).The idea of \u201cplaying\u201d by simply moving around a room sounds a bit ridiculous\u2026 but also kind of fun.The key is the Moving Variance of the spatial turbulence: this value is continuous and stable, making it perfect for mapping directly to pitch/frequency, just like the original Theremin. Other features can be mapped to volume and timbre.It\u2019s pure signal processing, running entirely on the ESP32. Has anyone here experimented with audio synthesis or sonification using real-time signal processing?reply",
      "I wonder if somebody could make an open hardware version of the Leap Motion with this technique (though I'm not sure how accurate/repeatable the sensing is - Leap Motion could detect with an accuracy of < 0.7mm)reply",
      "I'm sure the kids will love this! Wi-Fi Theremin sounds great.reply",
      "You hit the nail on the head! That's precisely the motivation.Having two kids myself, I've thought of turning it into a game: blindfolded hide-and-seek where the pitch of the Wi-Fi Theremin tells the seeker how close they are to the 'signal disruption' of the other person. It's essentially a real-time sonar game!reply",
      "I see you have done a fair amount of work to document calibration for various scenarios. Have you tried to calibrate to ignore cats? Can you prioritize different algorithms to focus on size rather than speed of movement?Also, I use an ebay purchased ruckus router designed for commercial settings. Will the stronger signal and beam forming from the router provide better or worse performance, or is that mainly down to the esp32?reply",
      "Been working on this very idea casually for couple years with ESP-IDF and I could never get the statistical signal processing just right (by my definition). Things I've tried: adapting filtering (LMS, Kalman), kernel methods (NEWMA, MMD), detectors (CUSUM, GLR), dimensionality reduction (random projection, online PCA), whitening, etc.I use a single ESP32 in STA/AP mode which sniffs ACK packets with a specific destination mac, which come from any server on my WiFi network (uses a special sniffing mode IIRC). This way I can receive regular CSI packets originating from a fixed location and doesn't need another device running.I'll have to look at this code, maybe I just overlooked the obvious or my requirements were too high!reply",
      "ESPectre takes a different architectural approach that might address some of the challenges you encountered:1. Instead of STA/AP mode on a single ESP32, ESPectre uses the natural traffic between your existing router and an ESP32-S3 in station mode. To ensure a stable, continuous CSI packet rate, I implemented a traffic generator that sends ICMP pings to the gateway at a configurable rate (default: 20 pps). This provides bidirectional traffic (request + reply) that reliably triggers CSI generation, giving you predictable packet timing without relying on ambient network traffic or special sniffing modes.2. Rather than applying filters directly to raw CSI, ESPectre uses Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS) on unfiltered spatial turbulence (std dev of subcarrier amplitudes).3. The filters are applied to features, not to the segmentation signal itself. This preserves motion sensitivity while cleaning up the feature dataI found that having a stable transmitter (the router) combined with controlled traffic generation provides more consistent multipath patterns and predictable CSI timing, which makes the segmentation more reliable.reply",
      "Actually I misspoke. I previously used STA/AP mode (and two ESP32s) but I switched to something close to what you describe. I filter the pings to only get the ones targeting a specific MAC (in promiscuous mode). This way I get only specific CSI packets and they're perfectly periodic at whatever rate I want.Sounds like your MVS approach is a sliding window variance of the cross channel variance, with some adaptive thresholding. My pre-processing has generally been an EWMA de-meaning filter followed by some type of  dimensionality reduction and feature extraction (kernel or hand-crafted, like raw moments), which I think fits into your overall architecture.I'll have to look more closely at your work, thanks for sharing!reply",
      "Interesting note, I actually disabled promiscuous mode after some testing because it made the CSI signal noisier and consumed more resources. \nI found that normal station mode with pings to gateway gave me cleaner, more predictable CSI data. But your MAC filtering approach might mitigate those issues!You're spot on about the MVS approach. It's essentially a sliding window variance of the spatial turbulence (std dev across subcarriers), with adaptive thresholding based on the moving variance of that signal.If you're interested in the MVS details, I wrote a free Medium article that walks through the segmentation algorithm step-by-step with visualizations. Links are in the README.Your approach is actually quite similar to what I'm doing, just in a different order:- My flow: Raw CSI \u2192 Segmentation (MVS) \u2192 Filters (Butterworth/Wavelet/Hampel/SG) \u2192 Feature extraction- Your flow: Raw CSI \u2192 EWMA de-meaning \u2192 Dimensionality reduction \u2192 Feature extractionThe main difference is that I segment first to separate IDLE from MOTION states (keeping segmentation on raw, unfiltered CSI to preserve motion sensitivity), then only extract features during MOTION (to save CPU cycles).Thanks for the thoughtful feedback! Always great to exchange notes with someone who's been in the trenches with CSI signal processingreply"

      "This is probably one of the best summarizations of the past 10 years of my career in SRE. Once your systems get complex enough, something is always broken and you have to prepare for that. Detection & response become just as critical as pre-deploy testing.I do worry about all the automation being another failure point, along with the IaC stuff. That is all software too! How do you update that safely? It's turtles all the way down!reply",
      "Thank you!One of the question I frequently get is \"do you automatically rollback\". And I have hide in the corner and say \"not really\". Often, if you knew a rollback would work, you probably could also have known to not roll out in the first place. I've seen a lot of failures that only got worse when automation attempted to turn the thing on and off again.Luckily from an automation roll-out standpoint, it's not that much harder to test in isolation. The harder parts to validate are things like \"Does a Route 53 Failover Record really work in practice at the moment we actually need it to work?\"Usually the answer is yes, but then there's always the \"but it too could be broken\", and as you said, it's turtles all the way down.The nice part is realistically, the automation for dealing with rollout and IaC is small and simple. We've split up our infrastructure to go with individual services, so each piece of infra is also straight forward.In practice, our infra is less DRY and more repeated, which has the benefit of avoiding complexity that often comes from attempting to reduce code duplication. The ancillary benefit is that, simple stuff changes less frequently. Less frequent changes because less opportunity for issues.Not-surprisingly, most incidents comes from changes humans make. Where the second most amount of incidents come from assumptions humans make about how a system operates in edge conditions. If you know these two things to be 100% true, you spend more time designing simple systems and attempting to avoid making changes as much as possible, unless it is absolutely required.reply",
      "Iac is definitely a failure point, but the manual alternative is much worse! I\u2019ve had a lot of benefit from using pulumi, simply because the code can be more compact than the terraform hcl was.For example, for the fall over regions (from the article) you could make a pulumi function that parameterizes only the n things that are different per fall over env and guarantee / verify the scripts are nearly identical. Of course, many people use modules / terragrunt for similar reasons, but it ends up being quite powerful.reply",
      "I think some people are going to scream when I say this, but we're using mostly CloudFormation templates.We don't use the CDK because it introduces complexity into the system.However to make CloudFormation usable, it is written in typescript, and generates the templates on the fly. I know that sounds like the CDK, but given the size of our stacks, adding an additional technology in, doesn't make things simpler, and there is a lot of waste that can be removed, by using a software language rather than using json/yaml.There are cases we have some OpenTofu, but for infrastructure resources that customer specific, we have deployments that are run in typescript using the AWS SDK for javascript.It would be nice if we could make a single change and have it roll-out everywhere. But the reality is that there are many more states in play then what is represented by a single state file. Especially when it comes to interactions between\u2014our infra, our customer's configuration, and the history of requests to change the configuration, as well as resources with mutable states.One example of that is AWS certificates. They expire. We need them expiring. But expiring certs don't magically update state files or stacks. It's really bad to make assumptions about a customer's environment based on what we thought we knew the last time a change was rolled out.reply",
      "I actually like terraform for its LACK of power (tho yeah these days when I have a choice I use a lot of small states and orchestrate with tg).Pulumi or CDK are for sure more powerful (and great tools) but when I need to reach for them I also worry that the infra might be getting too complex.reply",
      "Agreed, it is much too easy to fall into bad habits. The whole goal of OpenTofu is declarative infrastructure. With CDK and pulumi, it's very easy to end up in a place where you lose that.But if you need to do something in a particular way, the tools should never be an obstacle.reply",
      "IMO Pulumi and CDK are an opportunity to simplify your infra by capturing what you\u2019re working with using higher-level abstractions and by allowing you to refactor and extract reusable pieces at any level. You can drive infra definitions easily from typed data structures, you can add conditionals using natural language syntax, and stop trying to program in a configuration language (Terraform HCL with surprises like non-short-circuited AND evaluation).You still end up having IaaC. You can still have a declarative infrastructure.reply",
      "That's how we use CDK.  Our CDK (in general) creates CloudFormation which we then deploy.  As far as the tooling which we have for IaC is concerned, it's indistinguishable from hand-written CloudFormation \u2014 but we're able to declare our intent at a higher level of abstraction.reply",
      "Absolutely, the best case is it's much better, safer, readable etc. However, the worst case is also worse. From the perspective of someone who provides devops support to multiple teams, terraform is more \"predictable\".reply",
      "If you do use terraform, for the love of god do NOT use Terraform Cloud. Up there with Github in the list of least reliable cloud vendors. I always have a \"break glass\" method of deploying from my work machine for that very reason.reply"

The kernel should expose a raw network device. I get physical or layer 2 configuration happening in the kernel, but if it is supposed to do IP, then why stop there, why not TLS as well?

While there is a lot of self-reflection and growth in this piece, a lot of the points felt more like learning how to charm, manipulate, and game social interactions.Look at the first two subheadings:> 1: Connecting with people is about being a dazzling person> 2: Connecting with people is about playing their gameThe post felt like a rollercoaster between using tricks to charm and manipulate, and periods of genuinely trying to learn how to be friends with people.I don't want to disparage the author as this is a personal journey piece and I appreciate them sharing it. However this did leave me slightly uneasy, almost calling back to earlier days of the internet when advice about \"social skills\" often meant reductively thinking about other people, assuming you can mind-read them to deconstruct their mindset (the section about identifying people who feel underpraised, insecure, nervous,) and then leverage that to charm them (referred to as \"dancing to the music\" in this post).Maybe the takeaway I'd try to give is to read this as an interesting peek into someone's mind, but not necessarily great advice for anyone else's situation or a healthy way to view relationships.reply",
      "> a lot of the points felt more like learning how to charm, manipulate, and game social interactions.A lot of stuff \"normal\" people do is charm, manipulate, and game social interactions. Except because they are not conscious about it, we give them a pass. One of the characteristics of autistic-spectrum individuals is that they must make a conscious effort to achieve goals that are achieved unconsciously by most of us. If we prevent such individuals from learning all that rarely-written-down stuff consciously because it seems \"distasteful\" to us, then we are disadvantaging such individuals socially.reply",

In other words, it\u2019s not a zero-cost abstraction.C++\u2019s shared pointer has the same problem; Rust avoids it by having two types (Rc and Arc) that the developer can select from (and which the compiler will prevent you from using unsafely).reply",
      "> the shared pointer implementation uses a POSIX mutex [...] C++\u2019s shared pointer has the same problemIt doesn't. C++'s shared pointers use atomics, just like Rust's Arc does. There's no good reason (unless you have some very exotic requirements, into which I won't get into here) to implement shared pointers with mutexes. The implementation in the blog post here is just suboptimal.(But it's true that C++ doesn't have Rust's equivalent of Rc, which means that if you just need a reference counted pointer then using std::shared_ptr is not a zero cost abstraction.)reply",

      "I think they\u2019re one and the same: C++ doesn\u2019t have program-level thread safety by construction, so primitives like shared pointers need to be defensive by default instead of letting the user pick the right properties for their use case.Edit: in other words C++ could provide an equivalent of Rc, but we\u2019d see no end of people complaining when they shoot themselves in the foot with it.(This is what \u201czero cost abstraction\u201d means: it doesn\u2019t mean no cost, just that the abstraction\u2019s cost is no greater than the semantically equivalent version written by the user. So both Arc and shared_ptr are zero-cost in a MT setting, but only Rust has a zero-cost abstraction in a single-threaded setting.)reply",
      "I can't say I agree with this? If C++ had an Rc equivalent (or if you'd write one yourself) it would be just as zero cost as it is in Rust, both in a single-threaded setting and in a multithreaded-setting. \"Zero cost abstraction\" doesn't mean that it cannot be misused or that it doesn't have any cognitive overhead to use correctly, just that it matches whatever you'd write without the abstraction in place. Plenty of \"zero cost\" features in C++ still need to you pay attention to not accidentally blow you leg off.Simply put, just as a `unique_ptr` (`Box`) is an entirely different abstraction than `shared_ptr` (`Arc`), an `Rc` is also an entirely different abstraction than `Arc`, and C++ simply happens to completely lack `Rc` (at least in the standard; Boost of course has one). But if it had one you could use it with exactly the same cost as in Rust, you'd just have to manually make sure to not use it across threads (which indeed is easier said than done, which is why it's not in the standard), exactly the same as if you'd manually maintain the reference count without the nice(er) abstraction. Hence \"zero cost abstraction\".reply",

(It has almost no traffic and it serves a small town and a mine and it's not connected to the rest of the North American system.)  Similarly they depict sections of rail in Canada that were out of service many years before this map was published.  So they're quite out of date.  To not show that Canada is linked by rail with the USA at Detroit is a definite oversight, too.Seeing through the lens of railroads is probably an artifact of both ideology and the economic reality in North Korea.  And maybe also the implicitly military purpose of these maps.reply",
      "I thought that too, but the map for the UK is very weird - there is no direct connection between what looks like Birmingham and what looks like Manchester or anywhere in the North West of England. So, no West Coast Main Line? Instead they have the rail line veering off towards the peak district.I don't know whether they're decades out of date or just plain wrong - the West Coast Main Line was \"opened between 1837 and 1881\" according to Wikipedia.reply",
      "Also the UK seems to include the Grand Union canal and River Severn but not the River Thames. It seems quite random.reply",
      "Hmm, if those red lines are meant to be rail lines than someone's definitely made some errors. E.g. the Europe map shows a red line in Iceland, perhaps between Reykjav\u00edk and Akureyri.  But there's no railway between Reykjav\u00edk and Akureyri and in fact there's no rail in Iceland at all.I just assumed the red lines were \"major routes\" of some sort, maybe rail, maybe roads.reply",
      "> No roads on those maps. This includes some quite obscure ones like the railway between Labrador and Sept-Iles, Quebec.I guess the maps are old, because they show the Newfoundland Railway, which was removed in the 80s.reply",
      "For Australia, at least, the rail lines are shown in red and major roads are shown in maroon.  The lines for the roads are mostly thinner than for the rail, but not consistently so.  At first glance, it's difficult to determine which lines are road and rail, unless you already know which is which.reply",
      "> So they're quite out of date.\"More specifically, it is an electronic edition published on CD in the first decade of the 2000s\"So no telling when the data was actually gathered/acquired before being \"frozen\" for publication.Also, if this is on something released to the NK public, then I'd imagine they are highly sanitized to make the rest of the world less impressive to those NK citizens that are allowed access to it. I'd strongly hope they provide their military better information, yet we know militaries are often lied to by their command.reply",
      "There's the San Bernardino Museum located at the train station in SB. Its next to the ATSF yards, so its sort of a combined SB and ATSF museum. On the wall there was a map of the US with all sorts of lines on it.Under closer scrutiny, all of the lines were railroads, and not highways. In fact, (I don't think) there were no highways at all. And it was all railroads, not just ATSF. I don't recall the date on the map.Just a fascinating \"other view\" of the world to look at the US through that lens.reply",
      "You can look at https://openrailwaymap.org/ for an up-to-date rail-only map of the world.Note it's infrastructure: lines may be freight-only, or only used occasionally.https://www.xn--pnvkarte-m4a.de/ is an equivalent for public transport routes.reply",
      "Yes,I noticed Kansas City is prominently featured on all the maps, which makes sense for rail hubs.But strange, then, that the north/south line (Kansas City Southern / Canadian Pacific) is not there.reply"
