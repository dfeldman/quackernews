      "The title is appropriate, in that it feels to me that most of the awe has gone out of these products/keynotes.  This is maybe down more to the maturity of the category(/ies) than any fault of Apple's though. Perhaps they can be blamed for failing to introduce exciting products in new categories.I do that find wireless earbuds actually last much longer than the wired variety, despite the non-replaceable batteries.  Back in the day I went through one or two sets of earbuds a year because the wire failed internally, whereas I've only had two TWS pairs in ~six years (admittedly, it was the battery that became a problem in the first set).

I'm not fully convinced about it, but it's different, it's fun, it's clever, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.The only thing I disagree with here is about the Air. I think Apple's strategy with the Air is to split the Pro line. Previously the Pro phones were for people who wanted a premium feeling and who wanted premium features, but those are often in tension, and might hold each other back. Now the Air is for those who want premium feel (you might call it flashy, looks great, feels great, but has trade-offs), and now the Pro is an uncompromising set of features, at the expense of being bigger and having a comical camera ~bump~ ~plateau~ continent. This is the same as the Watch, where you have the stainless steel models for the premium feel, and the Ultra for the premium features.I suspect many on HN may not differentiate between the premium features and feel as much \u2013 I know it's not what I jump to \u2013 because \"design is how it works\" and many here aren't as fashion conscious, but a lot of folks buy new phones based on the colour, or how thin it feels, or other details that are easily written off when you know more about the hardware. I think the Air might be a big hit, while getting very little of the enthusiast market.reply",
      "I don't know how widespread this is but in my little circle the orange Pro was the biggest draw, it's the first in the Pro line (or at least as far as I can remember) with real color to it. Most of them are grayscale or very muted colors. It's another \"feel\" thing but got more attention than the Air's thin body.reply",
      "These are my thoughts exactly. I've seen a bunch of people who don't value thinness or lightness in a phone getting dismissive or outright angry at the existence of the Air, and I want to grab them and shake them until they get it. I don't want the Air at all, and that's exactly why I'm thrilled it exists: it will split the Pro buyers into form-valuers and function-valuers, so the function-valuers like me can get an iPhone with a huge battery and a vapor chamber in it.If you're one of those people who goes \"why can't they make the phone thicker and heavier with more battery life\", you should be overjoyed at the Air, because now that those buyers are peeled off to a different SKU, the product line for you doesn't need to find a happy medium with them.reply"

      "React is winning because its really good. Even if the cost is an extra few milliseconds of render time and few extra hours of dev time figuring out things like hook dependencies.If React starts taking a backseat, it'll be because its no longer really good. And, to be fair: I've started to see this happen. Next & Vercel have totally taken over the React world, and they've proven to make quite poor architectural decisions. All great empires are destroyed from the inside, not out, and I think its possible Vercel could do this to React. But, also, even as Next seppukus itself, people will likely just fall back to React on Vite (or, there's Remix 3 that's I think still under development, but might end up being big).reply",
      "+1 React DX is really great. It started really great and it got weird and bloated but it's still really great relative to the JS landscape hell.But, also yes, it's a pain in the ass and a frustrating kind of necessary evil. So there is room for improvements.Nextjs is a living hell. The ironic thing is AI makes it dramatically more tolerable to the point it's actually pretty good. But that can't be a good thing in terms of architectural design can it? We're in odd times.Of course, it's easy to be a hater on the sidelines. I am guilty. Nextjs likely just does too much in it's own made-from-scratch clever way. use-client vs server is just out-of-the gate ridiculous. But then I suppose the real question is \"well if you want isomorphic environment, how else are you going to do it?\". My answers is  \"I wouldn't!\" but then vercel and the powers that be seem to have won the mindshare of the product crowd. At least for now.reply",
      "Honestly I think React DX kinda sucks, at least in some areas. Performance is one of the worst (`useMemo` and `componentShouldUpdate` are way to easy to ignore, constant re-renders are the norm and writing performant React code requires conscious effort to avoid footguns) but it's also just less self-explanatory than the alternatives I've tried.I started doing web dev before reactivity frameworks were a thing, and I found Vue to be the most intuitive of the frameworks available when I first needed reactivity. To me, Vue feels like HTML with superpowers while React feels like a whole new way of thinking about webapps. I'm honestly a bit surprised that the article doesn't mention Vue, since Vue is (and has been for a while) the most popular \"not React or Angular\" framework option. Newer versions of Vue even support the \"disappearing framework\" feature Svelte was built for, which I'm excited to take advantage of when my biggest work project finally moves to Vue 3.reply",
      "I think you've nailed it. It does come down to user preference.React _is_ a whole new way of thinking. Back in the days of jQuery it was very painful to stitch together web experience across HTML+CSS+JS. jquery provided much needed DX around utilities to navigate across these pieces. But it was still way too easy to treat HTML like your database and model user-state across a Frankenstein of server, json, html, and javascript.React was a paradigm shift. \"Screw it, everything is javascript.\" The web depends on js runtime, we know we're going to need it. It starts to makes the best future-forward sense to use the only full programming runtime available. From DX pov this was spectacular to speed up prototyping. And you can finally truly model state purely from data.What followed was a huge a mess (redux), but I always say, what do we expect? The web is a mess, and it's great because it's useful. Humans are a mess!---\nVUE: similar to angular I just don't align with \"super-powered html attributes\". It just doesn't make sense as a mental model. Because it's _not_ HTML spec and HTML is not a programming language. The more powerful the framework gets the more we reinvent a pseudo-programming language _through_ HTML. Angular was full-stop a no-go when I first saw it's for-loops in HTML.reply",
      "Neither react's JSX nor vue's template language are HTML.  But rejecting vue's template on grounds that it's not HTML seems odd.  React's JSX deviates from HTML in many ways.  Like class vs className.  XML self-closing vs HTML self-closing.  onchange vs oninput.  On purely aesthetic grounds, I can't understand how the react idiom of array.map() would ever be preferable to an affordance in the (non-HTML) template language for handling this normal standard thing that always happens.reply",
      "it's not about feigning html purity it's the opposite. Why pretend we're using HTML when it's not? so with react it becomes a js flavor, jsx, which some people hate but it's very clear that it's a made up language IN real javascript.edit: the mental model is instant: it's just javascript for reals. do anything you want in javascript using real js primitives. it's not about looking pretty, jsx doesn't. it's about not relearning basic programming primitives in a made up _markup_ language.my issue with angular is it's neither real html nor any programming language. its made up pseudo-programming language for no other reason than it fools people into thinking \"it's just HTML\". that's my gripe.reply",
      "Completely agree with you. Every time I see yet another template language adding some clumsy for-each loop syntax I sigh. Just let us use a normal programming language. As an example I give you every template system ever invented. Devops tooling is full of them.reply",

      "I've been extremely impressed (and actually had quite a good time) with GPT-5 and Codex so far. It seems to handle long context well, does a great job researching the code, never leaves things half-done (with long tasks it may leave some steps for later, but it never does 50% of a step and then just randomly mock a function like Gemini used to), and gives me good suggestions if I'm trying to do something I shouldn't. And the Codex CLI also seems to be getting constant, meaningful updates.reply",
      "Agreed. We're hardcore Claude Code users and my CC usage trended down to zero pretty quickly after I started using Codex. The new model updates today are great. Very well done OpenAI team!! CC was an existential threat. You responded and absolutely killed it. Your move Anthropic.reply",
      "To be fair, Anthropic kinda did this to themselves. I consider it as a pretty massive throw on their end in terms of the fairly tight grasp they had on developer sentiment.Everyone else slowly caught up and/or surpassed them while they simultaneously had quality control issues and service degradation plaguing their system - ALL while having the most expensive models comparatively in terms of intelligence.reply",
      "Agreed. I really wish Google would get their act together because I think they have the potential of being faster, cheaper with bigger context windows. They're so great at hardcore science and engineering, but they absolutely suck at products.reply",
      "I think this is being downvoted coz it doesn't seem to be really responding to the thread, and maybe it isn't, but for anyone who hasn't tried Gemini CLI:My experience after a month or so of heavy use is exactly this. The AI is rock solid. I'm pretty consistently impressed with its ability to derive insights from the code, when it works. But the client is flaky, the backend is flaky, and the overall experience for me is always \"I wish I could just use Claude\".Say 1 in 10 queries craps out (often the client OOMs even though I have 192Gb of RAM). Sounds like a 10% reliability issue but actually it just pushes me into \"fuck this I'll just do it myself\" so it knocks out like 50% of the value of the product.(Still, I wouldn't be surprised if this can be fixed over the next few months, it could easily be very competitive IMO).reply",

We need a greater balance of power.Antitrust enforcement has been letting us down for over two decades. If we don't have an oxygenation event, we'll go an entire generation where we only reward tax-collecting, non-innovation capital. That's unhealthy and unfair.Our career sector has been institutionalized and rewards the 0.001% even as they rest on their laurels and conspire to suppress wages and innovation. There's a reason why centicorns petered out and why the F500 is tech-heavy. It's because big tech is a dragnet that consumes everything it touches - film studios, grocery stores, and God only knows what else it'll assimilate in the unending search for unregulated, cancerous growth.FAANG's $500k TC is at the expense of hundreds of unicorns making their ICs even wealthier. That money mostly winds up going to institutional investors, where the money sits parked instead of flowing into huge stakes risks and cutthroat competition. That's why a16z and YC want to see increased antitrust regulations.But it's really bad for consumers too. It's why our smartphones are stagnant taxation banana republics with one of two landlords. Nothing new, yet as tightly controlled an authoritarian state. New ideas can't be tried and can't attain healthy margins.It's wild that you can own a trademark, but the only way for a consumer to access it is to use a Google browser that defaults to Google search (URLs are scary), where the search results will be gamed by competitors. You can't even own your own brand anymore.Winning shouldn't be easy. It should be hard. A neverending struggle that rewards consumers.We need a forest fire to renew the ecosystem.reply",

      "I've had a PP merchant account for well over a decade, to sell a boring, non computer related gadget. I make roughly one sale per business day, with typical statistical variation. PP has been nearly 100% reliable.Some advantages for me:1. I don't touch your credit card or personal info. I don't want to know those things. I don't want to be responsible for keeping them secure.2. Integration with the post office for generating shipping labels is seamless.3. I think people are more confident to buy something from a little known business if they feel that PP is protecting them. The increase in sales probably covers the PP fee.4. I can run my business from a passive web page. All of the other services require me to manage some kind of server, running code, that I become responsible for maintaining. I love coding, but don't want it to be part of this business.From reading articles and forum posts two main sources of horror stories seem to be:1.

Selling non-physical goods, which I can only imagine has its own pitfalls that I don't know about.reply",
      "To your horror stories, while I'm sure many of them do involve legitimate disputes, I stopped accepting PayPal payments about a decade ago after what they did to a friend of mine. He and his wife owned a small hotel that took payment several ways, including Paypal. They didn't have too many customers paying that way and had allowed something over $10,000 to pile up in their Paypal account over time. When they tried to withdraw it, Paypal froze their account and requested all sorts of additional verification. But even after they provided all this, Paypal refused to unfreeze the account. This dragged on for over a year.

My approach would have been to just the copy the file over and then make package-specific changes, so maybe better tool calling is at play here.Additionally, they claim the new model is more steerable (both with AGENTS.md and generally). In my experience, Codex CLI w/gpt-5 is already a lot more steerable than Claude Code, but any improvements are welcome![0]https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/core/gpt_...[1]https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/core/prom...reply",

      "Not suddenly, it's been better since GPT-5 launched.Prompting is different, but in a good way.With Claude Code, you can use less prompting, and Claude will get token happy and expand on your request. Great for greenfield/vibing, bad for iterating on existing projects.With Codex CLI, GPT-5 seems to handle instructions much more precisely. It won't just go off on it's own and do a bunch of work, it will do what you ask.I've found that being more specific up-front gets better results with GPT-5, whereas with Claude, being more specific doesn't necessarily stop the eagerness of it's output.As with all LLMs, you can't compare apples to oranges, so to clarify, my experiences are primarily with Typescript and Rust codebases.reply",

      "Codex CLI of course will sometimes do the wrong thing, or sometimes do something extra that you didn't intend for it to do.It seems about half my sessions quickly become \"why did you do that? rip __ out and just do ___\". Then again, most of the other sessions involve Codex correctly inferring what I wanted without having to be so specific.reply",
      "Sounds like the difference between finding what needs to be done, making a plan, and executing on it remains something to consider and be aware of.Claude Code has been a revelation and a bit of a let down the past 45 days.Some open acknowledgement would have been great, but in lieu of it, it seems it's best to hop on a new tool and make sure you learn how to prompt better and not rely on the model to read between until usage is \"optimized\" and it no longer seems to work for those folks.I've seen some interesting files that help any model understand a programming language as it's strong suit and it might not even be an expert in and how to best develop with it.reply",
      "It is 100% true. And they are rapidly losing users to Codex. Charts were shared recently showing a massive migration underway.reply",

They claim they've mitigated it but when 4.0 first dropped CC was really impressive, and now I constantly have to babysit it because any time it hits a challenge it'll just stop trying and make a simple toy version and declare false victory.  If I don't catch it and I let it build on top of that bullshit, things get nasty in a hurry.It's a shame because the plan is a great deal but the number of all caps and profanity laced messages I'm firing off at Claude is too damned high.reply",

      "I have at Tesla system with 3 batteries, and I argued during installation to include 8kw of panels situated on the west side of our roof against Tesla \u2018s engineering. The panels would only by 72% efficient on the west side as opposed to 74% on the east side (catching the morning sun). But my modeling showed that we would exhaust the batteries in the evening due to the fact that my usage was higher in the late afternoons and it wasn\u2019t offset by any generation of solar panels during those late afternoon hours.After modeling scenarios based on historical usage PER HOUR, I was able to show that if we had enough solar generation during peak late afternoon hours, we would be able to \u2018survive the night\u2019 on batteries until morning solar generation resumed. This means my 14kw solar panels coupled with 3 batteries gets me completely off grid for 9 months out of the year. That\u2019s not bad considering I get 7ft of snow during winter months and I am surrounded by very tall trees.Optimize on hourly generation not daily, most solar companies use DAILY numbers without a clue on hourly usage. I currently get 0.08$ for every 1$ in electric production, so there is very little benefit in producing electricity when you don\u2019t use it. Optimize your system based on your usage not on DAILY production. If electric companies would give me credit of say 0.90$ per 1$ then the equation changes, but electric companies would rather benefit from your overproduction, be careful as these systems are not cheap!reply",
      "The Powerwall system prioritizes filling up the batteries first. I assume it will take pretty much your entire solar day to fill your three batteries so why didn\u2019t you choose the model that fills up your buckets as the first priority? I think the rule is \u201coptimize on hourly storage\u201d and the hourly production should follow that requirement. Doesn\u2019t the 74% give you a bigger area under the production curve than the 72%?reply",
      "Bear in mind that charging and discharging batteries has an efficiency penalty - perhaps 98% efficient for each. So 74 stored is worse than 72 used directly because 74 -> 72.52 stored -> 71.06 discharged.And usually the efficiency is much worse than 98%.Oh, and also batteries such as the tesla power wall can only be charged and discharged about 1000 times before they have lost a lot of capacity. So generating when you use also makes your batteries last much longer. You could think of this as a cost of battery depreciation per kWh stored.reply",
      "That 1000 is for NMC batteries and its a 70% capacity.  Still enough to be useful.Also, there's a lot of factors that go into play.  For example, this assumes the batteries are fully charged and discharged.  If you do something smarter like going down to 40% and up to 80% then they end up being able to do a lot more cycles.  In fact, battery age starts mattering more than the cycles.But besides that, LFP batteries are currently being used in home battery storage (including powerwalls) because it's cheaper and it has 5000->10,000 cycles before dropping to 70% capacity.Generally, though, I'd agree that having more generation throughout the day is better than having perfectly optimized generation.reply",
      "The Powerwall solar controller prioritizes the home before sending surplus to the grid. And in the home, the controller will send power direct to any running load first, then to the Powerwall battery. Any spillover then goes to the grid. It\u2019s very dynamic. I would go with the algorithm to \u201ccapture the rain into my rain buckets the moment I can\u201d because the rain could stop. Solar irradiance is unpredictable.reply",
      "If you have time based billing you can also input that into the system and it's even more effective. For example, if you tell it that electricity is cheap from 9am - 5pm (peak solar) and expensive from 5pm - 9pm  (peak residential demand) it will take your trending consumption and decide when your solar production isn't keeping up with foretasted demand and let you charge from the grid to at the cheap rate to make up the shortfall and minimize cost. It even factors in things like grid charging speed and total site usage limits, which are great given my 100amp panel.reply",

We also use about 3,800kWh of electricity each year. Obviously, we can't use all the power produced over summer and we need to buy power in winter. So here's my question:How big a battery would we need in order to be completely self-sufficient?Let's take a look at a typical summer's day. The graph is a little complex, so I'll explain it.The yellow line shows solar production. It starts shortly after sunrise, peaks at midday, and gradually drops until sunset.The red line shows how much electricity our home is using. As you can see, there's a large peak about 19:00 when we cook dinner.The blue line shows how much electricity we draw or export from the grid. From midnight until sunrise we import because the sun isn't shining. Once the sun has risen we're able to power our house and export to our nei"

      "The points the article make come close to my gripe with ghost kitchens but don't quite cover it:they feel like scams and when I've accidentally ordered from a ghost kitchen it was by design a terrible experience.I'm talking like, you order a 15$ main that is called \"creamy pasta with prosicutto\" and when it shows up its buttered spaghetti with a couple stamp-sized bits of ham. Ordering from actual restaurants come with some of the downsides the article assigns to ghost kitchens, like cold food and weird presentation, but ghost kitchens never seemed to reach the bar of \"food someone would actually order, even if it was teleported to them instantly\".reply",
      "THIS:>>\"food someone would actually order, even if it was teleported to them instantly\".The article states\n>>Quality control became impossible. Shared kitchen facilities meant that one staff member prepared food for multiple brands simultaneously. No ownership. No accountability. Just assembly-line cooking with zero connection to customers.I'm not sure if it was impossible or if management never actually prioritized it, not bothering to understand what an actual customer would want.  How much of it is the stupid management assumption that they can \"just make a dish generally meeting description X on the menu\" and deliver that and it'll be ok? \u00ab\u2014 Real question, did mgt fail at the product specification level, or was QC just as a practical matter, impossible?On the economics, it really seems 30% for delivery is insane.  It seems that same 30% might exceed the cost of the physical restaurant. And when it adds a 15-45min delay while homogenizing and cooling the meal, it seems an impossible problem.  Maybe if the 30% transported it instantly and losslessly...Probably good this soulless idea will die. Too bad so much perfectly good capital was squandered on it instead of better ideasreply",
