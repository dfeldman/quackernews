      "Note that NixOS and reproducible builds did not detect the xz backdoor, and in fact NixOS shipped the malicious builds of xz (though they didn't do anything because the malware didn't target NixOS):> I am a NixOS developer and I was surprised when the backdoor was revealed to see that the malicious version of xz had ended up being distributed to our users.As always theory and reality are different, and the thing that made xz possible was never a technical vulnerability with a technical solution\u2014xz was possible because of a meatspace exploit. We as a community are very very bad at recognizing that you can't always just patch meatspace with better software.\n \nreply",
      "> NixOS and reproducible builds did not detect the xz backdoorNix declarativeness is quite useful to increase protection against exploits in a number of ways. Unfortunately, there is still a lot of untapped potential. My number one priority would be to implement fine-grained ephemeral containers. Guix has these already.This would make it convenient to run every single process with restricted privileges, including no access to ~/, except those directories that are needed by the task. That would prevent e.g. a rogue pip package from stealing SSH keys.Still, I think the xz backdoor did not work on NixOS because its unusual non FHS-compliant filesystem structure.\n \nreply",
      "> I think the xz backdoor did not work on NixOS because its unusual non FHS-compliant filesystem structure.Right, but this is not part of the security model, it's an incidental attribute of the OS that's there for other reasons and easily solved for if the attacker had prioritized it. The only reason why it didn't work is because the attacker didn't bother making it work on NixOS, not because he couldn't have if he'd wanted to.\n \nreply",
      "You don\u2019t even need to run in a container for this. It\u2019s possible to do this entirely in systemd service configuration. The easiest way is just to have separate user for every service and reduce stuff running as root. You can also restrict filesystem access, network access and even syscall access (although some of this may be implemented as a container under the hood).Unfortunately, this wouldn\u2019t help with the xz vulnerability because the SSH server is the one loading the compromised library in that case (indirectly). Since SSH itself needs to have access to the private keys, it\u2019s not really easy to secure it against vulnerabilities in the library it loads itself.On the flip side, unless the vulnerability is in one of the important binaries/shared libraries, the amount of damage it can cause it probably quite contained with simply having good user isolation. Nix can make this analysis really simple (because of explicitly specified dependencies), so you can crack down on critical dependencies a lot more easily.\n \nreply",
      "> It\u2019s possible to do this entirely in systemd service configurationSure, but I think that leaves out many use cases. What if I want to e.g. start a Python shell that has access to certain directories, and nothing else, including no network access?Nix provides a good way of doing that for common use cases, as it has decent support for Firejail. But I would like something like Guix containers, which is convenient for any ad hoc use case. This greatly reduces any security threat. It's a poor-man's QubesOS.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, I guess most existing Linux stuff that is actually configured (so not SELinux etc) is geared at system processes not user ones. Transparently running all user applications in properly isolated containers would be quite neat.Does Firejail handle dynamic access (eg. I may want an xz invocation to work on my private keys, but not THIS specific one where I\u2019ve given it a completely different file?).I quite like pledge/unveil for this kind of thing on OpenBSD, although that\u2019s for a different threat model.\n \nreply",
      "Firejail and bwrap are setuid sandbox frontends. You can wrap e.g. a new xz invocation to let it work on your private keys.But Nix relies on ephemeral shells and flakes, and they don't play so well with each other. The interface is clumsy. Guix, in contrast, has a pretty nice set of CLI switches for these features.Even normal distros should prioritize some simple graphical UI for this. Running programs with minimal privileges would result in a significant enhancement of security. The kernel features for achieving this are already there.\n \nreply",
      "> Firejail and bwrap are setuid sandbox frontends.bwrap does not require SUID, it only needs it if user namespaces are disabled for unpriviledged users.\n \nreply",
      "Literally any container runtime can do this for you. No one does it though because it's annoying as hell to upfront figure out what you want, and then be unable to increase that list later.Like if I were to try and find a not annoying way to do this, it would be to snapshot and overlay mount my filesystem at process launch time, then give a heuristic warning at process termination about what was changed.But then we're still into basically SELinux territory which because of course there's upfront things we don't want to allow read access to - i.e. SSH keys.(don't know what the lesson here is other then \"for the love of god could we get a standardized secrets filesystem and/or API or something\". Looking at you Hashicorp Vault and ~/.vault-token).\n \nreply",

The backdoor had been covertly inserted by a malicious maintainer under the pseudonym of Jia Tan over a period of three years. This event deeply stunned the open source community as the attack was both of massive impact (it allowed remote code execution on all affected machines that had ssh installed) and extremely difficult to detect. In fact, it was only thanks to the diligence (and maybe luck) of Andres Freund \u2013 a Postgres developer working at Microsoft \u2013 that the catastrophe was avoided: while investigating a seemingly unrelated 500ms performance regression in ssh that he was experiencing on several Debian unstable machines, he was able to trace it back to the liblzma library, identify the backdoor and document it.While it was already established that the open source supply chain was often the target of"

      "A large amount of work in the last few years has gone into building benchmarks because models have been going though and beating them at a fairly astonishing rate.  It's generally accepted as true that passing any one of them does not constitute fully general intelligence but the difficult part has been finding things that they cannot do.   They are giving them more and more difficult tasks.  The ARC prize in particular was designed to be focused on reasoning more than knowledge.  The 87.5% score achieved in such a short time by throwing lots of resources at conventional methods was quite a surprise.You can at least have a degree of confidence that they will perform well in the areas covered by the benchmarks (as long as they weren't contaminated) and with enough benchmarks you get fairly broad coverage.\n \nreply",

      "Do bullets actually fall at exactly the same speed if dropped or fired horizontally? In a vacuum, obviously they do. But my intuition says there would be some impact on the vertical air resistance from travelling 500m/s in the horizontal direction. As the bullet pushes through the air, the air pressure above and below it is increased (you can actually see that in the photo in the post). So wouldn't it effectively be falling through denser air than in the dropped case? Also, of course, it would be falling in a horizontal orientation, whereas the dropped bullet would probably realign itself to vertical.Anyway, none of that invalidates the broader point, and the effects would be comparatively tiny even if present. Just found it interesting to consider.\n \nreply",
      "Fair warning, you are standing on the precipice of a very deep rabbit hole :-). My Dad was a 're-loader' (loaded his own ammunition) and molded his own bullets and had charts and graphs for an amazing set of things. I even built him a chronograph so that he could \"know\" the speed of a bullet as it left the gun.Given that a 'zeroed in' sight will account for the drop and so points the barrel up slightly, some of the energy in a shot goes to lifting it \"up\" before it starts falling down. You might think that would make it take longer, but it's small. The sin of 0.5 degrees is only .00873 so less than 1% of \"heading up\" before heading down. The more 'up' you point it,  the bigger the difference. But as the author points out, the impact of various factors varies. Dad was happy he could put three rounds from his 30-06 into a 3\" target circle at 200 yds.\n \nreply",
      "That's a bit of a mistaken model, the bullet never rises above the boreline of the gun, the scope or sights are just angled down relative to the bore line to intersect the bullet trajectory at a particular point further down range. [0] The effect is larger if your scope is higher above the bore axis, because it requires you to point down more on the sight line to have the same zero, or if your zero is particularly close or far, for most rifle rounds and gun configurations 100 yard zeros tend to be all drop (the combination of realistic height over bore and bullet trajectories just work out that way).[0] This is a pretty accurate representation: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/40/f3/05/40f3...\n \nreply",

      ">  As the bullet pushes through the air, the air pressure above and below it is increased (you can actually see that in the photo in the post)That's just a 2d slice/projection of the air density, the shock wave you see is actually conical and symmetric around the whole bullet it's just not possible to capture with schlieren photography.As far as I know the pressure above and below are basically identical the bullets are symmetric and until they're well subsonic (the transition between super and sub sonic is a lot of what defines the effective accurate range of a round because the transition is chaotic so it's hard to predict and account for it's path after transitioning) they're traveling so fast forward there's effectively no angle of attack to generate a differential on either side of the bullet. If it does generate a negligible amount of lift it's completely dominated by the force of gravity pulling it down.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, of course the shock wave is conical; I just highlighted above and below because they're the only directions likely to influence how quickly the bullet falls.I don't think the effect would generate lift per se, assuming a horizontally fired bullet (since, again, it's symmetrical). What it does seem to me though is that it would effectively increase the density of air local to the bullet (in all directions except for behind), and so it would essentially be falling through denser air than it would be if just dropped from stationary. That would result in a small but non-zero increase in the time taken to fall the same distance.Again though, that's just what intuition tells me; I certainly haven't tried to model it or anything.\n \nreply",

      "Some great stories about Dirac's \"unusual\" personality: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac#PersonalityOne of my favorite theologians, physicist-turned-Anglican-priest Dr. John Polkinghorne FRS, did his Ph.D in Dirac's group. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Polkinghorne\n \nreply",
      "A famous great anecdote about Dirac (and Bohr and Rutherford) was in Absolute Zero Gravity:--Young Dirac arrived at Niels Bohr\u2019s institute with a glowing recommendation from the great experimentalist Ernest Rutherford. A few months later, Bohr remarked to Rutherford that this marvelous Dirac hardly seemed so special: he said nothing and he did nothing. Legend has it that Rutherford replied with the following story:A man went to a pet shop to buy a parrot. There was a gray parrot that knew a few words selling for one hundred dollars. There was a blue parrot that could sing and tell stories for two hundred dollars. There was a beautiful green and purple bird that spoke several ancient languages for five hundred dollars. And there was a nondescript brown bird priced at a thousand dollars.\u201cA thousand dollars!\u201d exclaimed the would-be buyer. \u201cThat must be some bird - how many languages does he speak?\u201d \u201cJust English,\u201d admitted the shopkeeper.\u201cHis vocabulary is extraordinary, perhaps?\u201d The shopkeeper shrugged. \u201cNot really\u201d.\u201cDoes he sing, then?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the shopkeeper. \u201cMost days this parrot doesn\u2019t even talk\u201d.\u201cWell, does he do acrobatic tricks or something? What on earth is so valuable about that parrot?\u201d\u201cSir, this parrot thinks\u201d.Rutherford concluded, \u201cDirac thinks\u201d.\n \nreply",

      "The book \"the strangest man\" goes in depth about his life and how weird that guy was.

      "I read in Friedrich Hund's Wikipedia biography that while he was in Jena in after WWII in East Germany, the head of the Thuringen state government awarded him in 1949.... a voucher for a pair of shoes (a copy of the letter is on  Wikipedia) as recognition of his academic merits.He ended up emigrating to the West in 1951, and thus avoided the bloody 1953 Soviet repression of unions demands in Jena. Question to Germans: Was the shoe voucher a more or less hidden message, or just typical postwar East German socialism?https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Brief_Eg...\n \nreply",
      "Not an expert either, esp. because I'm too young and socialized in West Germany with family ties to Thuringia, though.What always struck me was Eastern Germans' tendency to practical things (and an enormous creativity in fixing broken stuff!). \nIn addition, this is 1949 Eastern Germany, the country was devastated and this part under Soviet rule. It might sound a bit weird as a gift from today's wealthy point of view but historically \"a good pair of shoes\" was always something people appreciated throughout all times and cultures.\n \nreply",
      "> historically \"a good pair of shoes\" was always something people appreciated throughout all times and cultures(It seems I am indulging in anecdotes a bit in this page, but anyway) In the portrait of \"Lenin\" Ulyanov by Paul Johnson in Modern Times, you will read> Lenin left Zurich to return to Russia on 8 April 1917.

      "I work in population genomics (non-human organisms), and myself participated in an early near-whole genome genotyping study back when microarrays were still the predominant technology (academic NOT commercial).But for nearly 20 years I've been telling my extended family NOT to participate in any large scale genotyping with 23 and Me or similar commercial companies where they retain rights to your data, anticipating that something like the current scenario would likely play out.Somehow, 23 and Me genotyping became the \"gift du jour\" for Xmas some years back -- I never personally understood that or why someone would want to turn over so much data to a commercial entity.This is not to say that large scale sequence information is not appropriate for *some people*.  But if that's something you need, make every effort to make sure you own your own data.\n \nreply",
      "> I never personally understood thatIt\u2019s a pretty simple cost/benefit equation.For 90%+ of people, the benefit (or appeal) of seeing an ancestry report is greater than the cost (or risk) of handing over your DNA.That said, it\u2019s definitely fair to question why more people don\u2019t take their personal privacy seriously. The reality is companies like Google (and 23andme) simply wouldn\u2019t exist if everyone cared as much about privacy as the HN crowd. Google exists because consumers are fine with sharing their data, for better or worse.\n \nreply",

I would wager most users don\u2019t even know about the license terms.It\u2019s the same as infosec in general.

They met up, and got along remarkably well, and have actually remained pretty close since! These things do happen. Glad you got something out of it, too.Yeah, these experiences may or may not be rare.

AmigaDOS is based on TRIPOS, but was expanded and added to by both the original Amiga team and then Commodore. One thing that remains basically the same is the parser for shell scripts, or sequence files as they're called in TRIPOS. The script parser is reasonably competent for a 1980:s home computer OS and can be used for solving real world made up programming problems.\n\nThe parser accepts a few special directives, such as .KEY, which is used to describe the template for arguments passed to the script file. For example, .KEY FILENAME/A tells the parser that the script accepts a string argument called FILENAME. These directives are placed at the start of the script file. \n\nBy default, the parser does string interpolation using the chara"
