      "This really captures something I've been experiencing with Gemini lately. The models are genuinely capable when they work properly, but there's this persistent truncation issue that makes them unreliable in practice.I've been running into it consistently, responses that just stop mid-sentence, not because of token limits or content filters, but what appears to be a bug in how the model signals completion. It's been documented on their GitHub and dev forums for months as a P2 issue.The frustrating part is that when you compare a complete Gemini response to Claude or GPT-4, the quality is often quite good. But reliability matters more than peak performance. I'd rather work with a model that consistently delivers complete (if slightly less brilliant) responses than one that gives me half-thoughts I have to constantly prompt to continue.It's a shame because Google clearly has the underlying tech. But until they fix these basic conversation flow issues, Gemini will keep feeling broken compared to the competition, regardless of how it performs on benchmarks.https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai/issues/707https://discuss.ai.google.dev/t/gemini-2-5-pro-incomplete-re...reply",

This way I didn't have to recreate a whole editor and got the real-time preview I wanted.- The way the SVG preview and the 'real font' are constructed is different. I talk about this a bit more on my blog [1] but in short in SVG I can use \"thick lines\" with rounded corners, and for the font I have to render polygons and I found a great library \"mfogel/polygon-clipping\" that makes the process of combining them a breeze.Thank you all for the interest!

      "Fun fact: Bob Colwell (chief architect of the Pentium Pro through Pentium 4) recently revealed that the Pentium 4 had its own 64-bit extension to x86 that would have beaten AMD64 to market by several years, but management forced him to disable it because they were worried that it would cannibalize IA64 sales.> Intel\u2019s Pentium 4 had our own internal version of x86\u201364. But you could not use it: we were forced to \u201cfuse it off\u201d, meaning that even though the functionality was in there, it could not be exercised by a user. This was a marketing decision by Intel \u2014 they believed, probably rightly, that bringing out a new 64-bit feature in the x86 would be perceived as betting against their own native-64-bit Itanium, and might well severely damage Itanium\u2019s chances. I was told, not once, but twice, that if I \u201cdidn\u2019t stop yammering about the need to go 64-bits in x86 I\u2019d be fired on the spot\u201d and was directly ordered to take out that 64-bit stuff.https://www.quora.com/How-was-AMD-able-to-beat-Intel-in-deli...reply",
      "That's no guarantee it would succeed though - AMD64 also cleaned up a number of warts on the x86 architecture, like more registers.While I suspect the Intel equivalent would do similar things, simply from being a big enough break it's an obvious thing to do, there's no guarantee it wouldn't be worse than AMD64. But I guess it could also be \"better\" from a retrospective perspective.And also remember at the time the Pentium 4 was very much struggling to get the advertised performance. One could argue that one of the major reasons that the AMD64 ISA took off is that the devices that first supported it were (generally) superior even in 32-bit mode.EDIT: And I'm surprised it got as far as silicon. AMD64 was \"announced\" and the spec released before the pentium 4 was even released, over 3 years before the first AMD implementations could be purchased.  I guess Intel thought they didn't \"need\" to be public about it? And the AMD64 extensions cost a rather non-trivial amount of silicon and engineering effort to implement - did the plan for Itanium change late enough in the P4 design that it couldn't be removed? Or perhaps this all implies it was a much less far-reaching (And so less costly) design?reply",
      "As someone who followed IA64/Itanium pretty closely, it's still not clear to me the degree to which Intel (or at least groups within Intel) thought IA64 was a genuinely better approach and the degree to which Intel (or at least groups within Intel) simply wanted to get out from existing cross-licensing deals with AMD and others. There were certainly also existing constraints imposed by partnerships, notably with Microsoft.reply",
      "Both are likely true.  It's easy to wave it away in hindsight, but there was genuine energy and excitement about the architecture in its early days.  And while the first chips were late and on behind-the-cutting-edge processes they were actually very performant (FPU numbers were world-beating, even -- parallel VLIW dispatch really helped here).Lots of people loved Itanium and wanted to see it succeed.

Their success has been accident and intervention over and over.If one can take popular histories of Intel at face value, they have had enough accidental successes, avoided enough failures, and outright failed so many times that they really ought to know better.The Itanium wasn't their first attempt to create an incompatible architecture, and it sounds like it was incredibly successful compared to the iAPX 432. Intel never intended to get into microprocessors, wanting to focus on memory instead. Yet they picked up a couple of contracts (which produced the 4004 and 8008) to survive until they reached their actual goal. Not only did it help the company at the time, but it proved essential to the survival of the company when the Japanese semiconductor industry nearly obliterated American memory manufacturers. On the flip side, the 8080 was source compatible with the 8008. Source compatibility would help sell it to users of the 8008. It sounds like the story behind the 8086 is similar, albeit with a twist: not only did it lead to Intel's success when it was adopted by IBM for the PC, but it was intended as a stopgap measure while the iAPX 432 was produced.This, of course, is a much abbreviated list. It is also impossible to suggest where Intel would be if they made different decisions, since they produced an abundance of other products. We simply don't hear much about them because they were dwarfed by the 80x86 or simply didn't have the public profile of the 80x86 (for example: they produced some popular microcontrollers).reply"

Almost certainly the answer is (or will be) yes.Will radiologists be replaced? Almost certainly the answer is no.Why not? Medical risk. Unless the law changes, a radiologist will have to sign off on each imaging report. So say you have an AI that reads images primarily and writes pristine reports. The bottleneck will still be the time it takes for the radiologist to look at the images and validate the automated report. Today, radiologist read very quickly, with a private practice rads averaging maybe 60-100 studies per day (XRs, ultrasounds, MRIs, CTs, nuclear medicine studies, mammograms, etc). This is near the limit of what a human being can reasonably do. Yes, there will be slight gains at not having to dictate anything, but still having to validate everything takes nearly as much time.Now, I'm sure there's a cavalier radiologist out htere who would just click \"sign, sign, sign...\" but you know there's a malpractice attorney just waiting for that lawsuit.reply",

If AI can do something well enough , and AI + humans surpass humans leading to costs reductions/ increased throughput this should be reflected in the workflows.I feel that human processes have inertia and for lack of a better word, gatekeepers feel that new, novel approaches should be adopted slowly and which is why we are not seeing the impact, yet. Once a country with the right incentive structure (e.g. China ) can show that it can outperform and help improve the overall experience I am sure things will change.While 10 years progress is a lot in ML, AI , in more traditional fields it probably is a blip to change this institutional inertia which will change generation by generation.

First, while models beat humans on benchmarks, the standardized tests designed to measure AI performance, they struggle to replicate this performance in hospital conditions. Most tools can only diagnose abnormalities that are common in training data, and models often don\u2019t work as well outside of their test conditions. Second, attempts to give models more tasks have run into legal hurdles: regulators and medical insurers so far are reluctant to approve or cover fully autonomous radiology models.

      "It looks promising overall, and I can see where this will save a ton of time for some types of data gathering. But I'm also seeing quite a lot of queries and processing going on, and it has only found about 3% of the data that I know is publicly available, after 20 minutes.It does say that extraction can take hours, but I was expecting it would be more of an 80/20 kind of thing, with a lot of data found quickly, then a long tail of searching to fill in gaps. Is my expectation wrong?I worry for two related reasons. One, inefficient gathering of data is going to churn and burn more resources than necessary, both on your systems and on the sites being hit. Secondly, although this free opportunity is an amazing way to show off your tool, I fear the pricing of an actual run is going to be high.reply",
      "Thanks for the feedback! From what we've seen it's actually the other way around - once it gets a sense of where this information lives the latter stages of data collection go quicker, especially since it's able to deploy search agents in parallel to get information and doesn't need to do the manual work as much anymore. Having said that, it does sometimes forget to do that, and although we've added the critic agent to remind it to do that it can be inconsistent but usually if you step in and ask it to deploy agents in parallel that fixes it.We use Gemini 2.5 Flash which is already pretty cheap, so inference costs are actually not as high as they would seem given the number of steps. Our architecture allows for small models like that to operate well enough, and we think those kinds of models will only get cheaper.Having said all that, we are working on improving latency and allowing for more parallelization wherever possible and hope to include that in future versions, especially for enrichment. We do think that one of the weaknesses of the product is for mass collection - it's better at finding medium sized datasets from siloed sources and less good at getting large comprehensive datasets, but we're also considering approaches that incorporate more traditional scraping tactics for finding these large datasets.reply",

      "When I read your description, I thought, \"This is just like the Exa dataset, no?\" but then I gave it a try, and I am genuinely impressed.Great decision to make it without a login so people can test.Here is what I liked:- The agent told me exactly what's happening, which sources it is checking, and the schema.- The agent correctly identified where to look at, and how to obtain the data.- Managing expectations: Webhound is extracting data\nExtraction can take multiple hours. We'll send you an email when it's complete.Minor point:- There is no pricing on the main domain, just the HN one https://hn.webhound.ai/pricingGood luck!reply",
      "Thanks, glad to hear you had a good experience.We were heavily inspired by tools like Cursor - basically tried to prioritize user control and visibility above everything else.What we discovered during iteration was that our users are usually domain experts who know exactly what they want. The more we showed them what was happening under the hood and gave them control over the process, the better their results got.reply",
      "Since it looks like you are built on FireCrawl, and FireCrawl itself has similar products like FireEnrich, how do you see yourself maintaining a differentiation and compete with FireCrawl directly, if they just decide to copy you?As an aside, we are about to launch something like similar at rtrvr.ai but having AI Web Agents navigate pages, fill forms and retrieve data. We are able to get our costs down to negligible by doing headless, serverless browsers and our own grounds up DOM construction/actuation (so no FireCrawl costs).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIU3K4E8pywreply",
      "Good point. Our main differentiation is the shared workspace - users can step in and guide the agent mid-task, kind of like Cursor vs Claude (which can technically generate the same code that Cursor does). Firecrawl (or any crawler we may use) is only part of the process, we want to make the collaborative process for user <> agent as robust and user controllable as possible.reply",

      "Great job on the launch. This is fills an exact need my company has, and your UI is fantastic. One nit, it would be nice to be able to manually edit the schema instead of only interacting with the LLM.I am concerned about your pricing, as \"unlimited\" anything seems to be fading away from most LLM providers. Also, I don't think it makes sense for B2B clients who have no problem paying per usage. You are going to find customers that want to use this to poll for updates daily, for example.Are you using proxies for your text-based browser? I am curious how you are circumventing web crawling blocking.reply",
      "Thanks a lot regarding UI and good point on the schema editing.We've been having similar thoughts about pricing and offering unlimited, but since it is feasible for us in the short term due to credits we enjoy offering that option to early users, even if it may be a bit naive.Having said that, we are currently working on a pilot with a company whom we are offering live updates, and they are paying per usage since they don't want to have to set it up themselves, so we can definitely see the demand there. We also offer an API for companies that want to reliably query the same thing at a preset cadence, which is also usage based.For crawling we use Firecrawl. They handle most of the blocking issues and proxies.reply"

Software like PGP is easy to use, and criminals already do. The government has absolutely no possibility of breaking RSA the way things are now, and as such scanning all messages will do nothing other than prove more definitively that criminals are still beyond their gavel. In reality, the only individuals who will get spied on are regular people who don't open their terminal just to send a text; exactly the people who should not be spied on in the first place.When the government realizes this invasive legislature is ineffective, they will probably crack down even harder. After all, what we are willing to accept from rulers has by the looks of it already increased dramatically.

They cannot tolerate it.It's a politico-technological arms race. They make their silly laws. We make technologies that completely nullify those laws. They need to increase their overall tyranny just to maintain the exact same level of control they had before. The end result is either an uncontrollable, ungovernable, unpoliceable population, or a totalitarian state that surveils, monitors and controls everything. There is no middle ground.We are rapidly advancing towards this totalitarianism, and we are eventually going to find out if the people have what it takes to resist and become ungovernable.One day we will need government signatures to run software on \"our\" computers.

      "I wonder how much Julia\u2019s JIT could help inform Python\u2019s.Diagram:  \nhttps://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/img/compiler_diagra...Documentation:  \nhttps://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/eval/From what I understand, Julia doesn\u2019t do any tracing at all, it just compiles each function based on the types it receives. Obviously Python doesn\u2019t have multiple dispatch, but that actually might make compilation easier. Swap out the LLVM step with python's IR and they could probably expect a pretty substantial performance improvement. That said I don\u2019t know anything about compilers, I just use both Python and Julia.reply",
      "In the JS world, tracing was abandoned because it didn't scale to real world code.JS JITs (the production ones, like JSC's) have no such thing as trace blockers that prevent the surrounding code from being optimized. You might have an operation (like a call to some wacky native function) that is itself not optimized, but that won't have any impact on the JIT's ability to optimize the code surrounding that operation.Tracing is just too much of a benchmark hack overall IMO. Tracing would only be a good idea in a world where it's too expensive to run a real optimizing JIT. But the JS, Java, and .NET experiences show that a real optimizing JIT - with all of its compile time costs - is exactly what you want because it results in predictable speed-upsreply",
      "Pypy's tracing JIT has worked pretty well for years, so that doesn't seem universal. I admit I have fairly low expectations on a JIT succeeding (in any meaningful fashion) in cpython given the constraints that it currently has, but I'm generally a skeptic, so maybe i'm being overly pessimistic.reply",
      "What does \u201cworked pretty well\u201d really mean though?When we talk about JS or Java JITs working well, we are making statements based on intense industry competition where if a JIT had literally any shortcoming then a competitor would highlight it in competitive benchmarking and blog posts. So, the competition forced aggressive improvements and created a situation where the top JITs deliver reliable perf across lots of workloads.OTOH PyPy is awesome but just hasn\u2019t had to face that kind of competitive challenge. So we probably can\u2019t know how far off from JS JITs it is.One thing I can say is when I compared it to JSC by writing the same benchmark in both Python and JS, JSC beat it by 4x or so.reply",
      "I think the Java JITs are a better comparison because the workload is more similar: JavaScript is weird for how it\u2019s expected to start in a fraction of a second and soak up a huge bolus of code which may substantially never be used whereas most of the performance-sensitive Python code stabilizes quickly and loads what it uses really early on.reply",
      "The Java JIT and most other Javascript jits are essentially operating the same way.  The core difference is the java language spec sets up a whole bunch of requirements that need to be figured out at startup and are easy to trigger.For example, static initialization on classes.  The JDK has a billion different classes and on startup a not insignificant fraction of those end up getting loaded for all but the simplest applications.Essentially, Java and the JS jits are both initially running everything interpreted and when a hot method is detected they progressively start spending the time sending those methods and their statistics to more aggressive JIT compilers.A non-insignificant amount of time is being spent to try and make java start faster and a key portion of that is resolving the class loading problem.reply",
      "I don't know how JSC handles it, but in SM `eval` has significant negative effects on surrounding code. (We also decline to optimize functions containing `with` statements, but that's less because it's impossible and more because nobody uses them.)reply",
      "Last I saw (and I admit this is pretty dated) V8 was doing the same thing.  try/catch at one point in V8 would cause the surrounding method to be deoptimized.reply",
