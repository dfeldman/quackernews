      "It is a disgrace how Google has managed this situation.To recap the storyline, as far as I understand it: last August, Google announced plans to heavily restrict sideloading. Following community pushback, they promised an \"advanced flow\" for power users. The media widely reported this as a walk-back, leading users to assume the open ecosystem was safe.But this promised feature hasn't appeared in any Android 16 or 17 betas. Google is quietly proceeding with the original lockdown.The impact is a direct threat to independent AOSP distributions like Murena's e/OS/ (which I'm personally using). If installing a basic APK eventually requires a Google-verified developer ID, maintaining a truly de-Googled mobile OS becomes nearly impossible.reply",
      "If this finally pushes adoption of truly open Linux phones, then this will end up being a good thing, and the greatest favor that Google could do for the open source community.Tragically, Linux phones have languished and are in an absolute state these days, but a lot of the building blocks are in place if user adoption occurs en masse. (Shout out to the lunatics who have kept this dream alive during these dark years.)reply",
      "It won't though, because there's a ecosystem of banking/insurance/whatever apps that have bought into the android/iphone lockdown mindsete that people will simply be locked out of. Open alternatives can grow when there is a viable means of slow growth, and cutting off the oxygen to such things is the implicit intent.reply",
      "The best solution for this is to buy a $30 burner phone at Walmart and use it unactivated, tethered to your main de-Googled device. You can use the burner for only tasks requiring Play Integrity.Make sure to leave one star reviews on all such apps that you run into.reply",
      "> banking/insurance/whatever appsI know banking apps are the typical example, but I've always wondered why. I use my bank's app maybe once or twice a year when I need to Zelle someone, which I only need to do when they don't have Venmo. (Unless we consider Venmo a banking app.)I only have one bank's app installed, the rest of my banks I only interact with over their website, on desktop.As for insurance, I've never had an insurance company's app installed.Am I just an outlier here? Honestly, if I switched to a non standard OS, I'd be more annoyed about losing, say, Google Maps, Uber/Lyft, or various chat apps. Banking and insurance just don't come to mind at all as something I need my phone for.reply",
      "You're definitely not alone. I just checked the list of installed apps on my phone and found three different banking apps that I completely forgot about because I never use them. I installed them because I thought it would be convenient for checking things on the go, but I actually just ended up using the computer whenever I need to do real banking business. The only finance-related app I use with any regularity is Venmo for e.g. paying back a friend for covering dinner.Another commenter mentioned needing to get alerts for fraud, but none of the financial institutions i'm currently doing business with have any trouble sending me text messages. In fact I have the opposite problem, I can't get them to stop using text for 2FA codes...",
      "My bank sends me an alert when my card is used to make a transaction - handy for spotting fraud.I get an alert when a payment comes it - handy for knowing if a client has paid.I can quickly check my balance - handy for knowing if I can afford another round of drinks.I can repay a friend in two taps - handy if they've paid for dinner.Is anything essential? No. Is it something people use multiple times per day? Yes!reply",
      "I can get alerts in email or messages, no need dedicated app for that, I can track there also my balance, so only useful thing app provides are easy wire transfers from phone, which I never do, if I wanna transfer money is much more convenient work big display, proper keyboard and mouse than from phone.reply",
      "We've cultivated a tech culture that can't stand the slightest inconvenience.  People will give up nearly everything if it means avoiding the least bit of effort.We are so bonedreply",
      "So yes if it weren\u2019t for people wanting convenience the \u201cYear of Linux on the Desktop\u201d would have happened 25 years ago.What do you suggest? Everyone carry around their desktop computers and our CRT monitors like we did when we wanted to play Quake with friends?reply"

      "TBH I Think that DoS needs to stop being considered a vulnerability. It's an availability concern, and availability, despite being a part of CIA, is really more of a principle for security rather than the domain of security. In practice, availability is far better categorized as an operational or engineering concern than a security concern and it does far, far more harm to categorize DoS as a security conern than it does to help.It's just a silly historical artifact that we treat DoS as special, imo.reply",
      "The severity of the DoS depends on the system being attacked, and how it is configured to behave on failure.If the system is configured to \"fail open\", and it's something validating access (say anti-fraud), then the DoS becomes a fraud hole and profitable to exploit. Once discovered, this runs away _really_ quickly.Treating DoS as affecting availability converts the issue into a \"do I want to spend $X from a shakedown, or $Y to avoid being shaken down in the first place?\"Then, \"what happens when people find out I pay out on shakedowns?\"reply",
      "If the system \"fails open\" then it's not a DoS, it's a privilege escalation. What you're describing here is just a matter of threat modeling, which is up to you to perform and not a matter for CVEs. CVEs are local properties, and DoS does not deserve to be a local property that we issue CVEs for.reply",

      "If the majority of your customers are good, failing closed will cost more than the fraud during the anti-fraud system's downtime.reply",
      "> I Think that DoS needs to stop being considered a vulnerabilityStrongly disagree. While it might not matter much in some / even many domains, it absolutely can be mission critical. Examples are: Guidance and control systems in vehicles and airplanes, industrial processes which need to run uninterrupted, critical infrastructure and medicine / health care.reply",
      "I think this is just sort of the wrong framing. Yes, a plane having a DoS is a critical failure. But it's critical at the level where you're considering broader scopes than just the impact of a local bug. I don't think this framing makes any sense for the CVE system. If you're building a plane, who cares about DoS being a CVE? You're way past CVEs. When you're in \"DoS is a security/ major boundary\" then you're already at the point where CVSS etc are totally irrelevant.CVEs are helpful for describing the local property of a vulnerability. DOS just isn't interesting in that regard because it's only a security property if you have a very specific threat model, and your threat model isn't that localized (because it's your threat model). That's totally different from RCE, which is virtually always a security property regardless of threat model (unless your system is, say, \"aws lambda\" where that's the whole point). It's just a total reversal.reply",

      "Three thoughts from someone with no expertise.1) If you make legal disclosure too hard, the only way you will find out is via criminals.2) If other industries worked like this, you could sue an architect who discovered a flaw in a skyscraper. The difference is that knowledge of a bad foundation doesn\u2019t inherently make a building more likely to collapse, while knowledge of a cyber vulnerability is an inherent risk.3) Random audits by passers-by is way too haphazard. If a website can require my real PII, I should be able to require that PII is secure. I\u2019m not sure what the full list of industries would be, but insurance companies should be categorically required to have an cyber audit, and laws those same laws should protect white hats from lawyers and allow class actions from all users.  That would change the incentives so that the most basic vulnerabilities are gone, and software engineers become more economical than lawyers.reply",
      "In other industries there are professional engineers. People who have a legal accountability. I wonder if the CS world will move that way, especially with AI. Since those engineers are the ones who sign things off.For people unfamiliar, most engineers aren't professional engineers. There are more legal standards for your average engineer and they are legally obligated to push back against management when they think there's danger or ethics violations, but that's a high bar and very few ever get in legal trouble, only the most egregious cases. But professional engineers are the ones who check all the plans and the inspections. They're more like a supervisor. Someone who can look at the whole picture. And they get paid a lot more for their work but they're also essential to making sure things are safe. They also end up having a lot of power/authority, though at the cost of liability. Think like how in the military a doctor can overrule all others (I'm sure you've seen this in a movie). Your average military doctor or nurse can't do that but the senior ones can, though it's rare and very circumstantial.reply",
      "You'd be surprised how many SE's would love for this to happen. The biggest reason, as you said, being able to push back.Having worked in low-level embedded systems that could be considered \"system critical\", it's a horrible feeling knowing what's in that code and having no actual recourse other than quitting (which I have done on few occasions because I did not want to be tied to that disaster waiting to happen).I actually started a legal framework and got some basic bills together (mostly wording) and presented this to many of my colleagues, all agreed it was needed and loved it, and a few lawyers said the bill/framework was sound .. even had some carve-outs for \"mom-n-pops\" and some other \"obvious\" things (like allowing for a transition into it).Why didn't I push it through? 2 reasons:1.) I'd likely be blackballed (if not outright killed) because \"the powers that be\" (e.g. large corp's in software) would absolutely -hate- this ... having actual accountability AND having to pay higher wages.2.) Doing what I wanted would require federal intervention, and the climate has not been ripe for new regulations, let alone governing bodies, in well over a decade.Hell, I even tried to get my PE in Software, but right as I was going to start the process, the PE for Software was removed from my state (and isn't likely to ever come back).I 100% agree we should have even a PE for Software, but it's not likely to happen any time soon because Software without accountability and regulation makes WAY too much money ... :(reply",
      "> You'd be surprised how many SE's would love for this to happen\n\nI'm one of them, and for exactly the reason you say.I worked as a physical engineer previously and I think the existence of PEs changes the nature of the game. I felt much more empowered to \"talk back\" to my boss and question them. It was natural to do that and even encouraged. If something is wrong everyone wants to know. It is worth disruption and even dealing with naive young engineers than it is to harm someone. It is also worth doing because it makes those engineers learn faster and it makes the products improve faster (insights can come from anywhere).Part of the reason I don't associate my name with my account is so that I can talk more freely. I absolutely love software (and yes, even AI, despite what some might think given my comments) but I do really dislike how much deception there is in our industry. I do think it is on us as employees to steer the ship. If we don't think about what we're building and the consequences of them then our ship is beholden to the tides, not us. It is up to us to make the world a better place. It is up to us to make sure that our ship is headed towards utopia rather than dystopia (even if both are more of an idea than reality). I'd argue that if it were up to the tides then we'll end up crashing into the rocks. It's much easier to avoid that if we're managing the ship routinely than in a panic when we're headed in that direction. I think software has the capacity to make the world a far better place. That we can both do good and make money at the same time. But I also think the system naturally will disempower us. When we fight against the tides things are naturally harder and may even look like we're moving slower. But I think we often confuse speed and velocity, frankly, because direction is difficult to understand or predict. Still, it is best that we try our best and not just abdicate those decisions. The world is complex, so when things work they are in an unstable equilibrium. Which means small perturbations knock us off. Like one ship getting stuck shutting down a global economy. So it takes a million people and a billion tiny actions to make things go right and stay right (easier to stay than fix). But many of the problems we hate and are frustrated by are more stable states. Things like how wealth pools up, gathered by only a few. How power does the same. And so on. Obviously my feelings extend beyond software engineering, but my belief is that if we want the world to be a better place it takes all of us. The more that are willing to do something, the easier it gets. I'd also argue that most people don't need to do anything that difficult. The benefit and detriment of a complex machine is that small actions have larger consequences. Just because you're a small cog doesn't mean you have no power. You don't need to be a big cog to change the world, although you're unlikely to get recognition.reply",

      "> I absolutely do not want to gatekeep beginners from being able to publish their work on the open internet\n\nFWIW there is no barrier like that for your physical engineers. Even though, as you note, professional engineers exist. Most engineers aren't professional engineers though, and that's why the barrier doesn't exist. We can probably follow a similar framing. I mean it is already more common for licensing to be attached to even random software and that's not true for the engineer's equivalents.reply",

The GDPR and other frameworks for PII usually do have a minimum size (in # of users) before they apply, which would help hobbyists.

      "I found the basic premise of this blog post to be incredibly flawed. The author seems very sure of himself that blue light filters don't work, but making arguments related to cell types and emissions spectra and circadian rhythms is not the way to make a conclusive argument in a topic like this. Science is littered with recommendations about things that \"plausibly\" made sense, but that turned out to be flawed or just absolutely wrong when actually put to a real, scientific test. One example most people are familiar with: the recommendation against eating eggs in the 90s was based on the fact that eggs have a lot of cholesterol, and we knew high LDL levels in blood were associated with a greater risk of vascular and heart problems. So, \"logically\", it seemed that limiting dietary cholesterol would reduce heart disease. Except when scientists actually tested those recommendations, they turned out to be largely wrong - when you eat a lot of cholesterol, for most people their body's natural production of cholesterol goes down, so unless you're in the small subset of people who are particularly sensitive to dietary cholesterol, eating eggs is fine.Making recommendations based solely on a theoretical mechanism of action is bad science. The only way to actually test this is with a study that looks at different types of light restriction and its effect on sleep. Obviously it's kind of impossible to do a blinded study for blue light filters, but you could get close by testing various permutations of light changes (e.g. total luminescence, eliminating only very specific wavelengths, etc.)As another commenter said, it may be a placebo effect, but if it is, who cares? All I care about is that I get a better night sleep, and as someone (unusual among programmers I know) who really doesn't like dark mode, a screen reddener greatly helps me at bedtime.reply",
      "His argument seems to be that the night modes don't remove much blue. My initial assumption was that it was about physical filters. Yellow or amber 99%+ safety lenses are a thing and several of my coworkers wear them.  Looking through them at those painfully bright blue leds makes them appear to be off. Yes everything looks strange, but they work. Likewise a different coworker manually removes all blue in the monitor settings themselves independent of the brightness setting. That also works. The author's assertion should be qualified amd narrowed a bit.reply",
      "I can absolutely confirm that night mode works wonders. Since ten years ago I discovered them I no longer have dry eye like problems.reply",
      "They absolutely help my eyes not be so strained. If its placebo, its a working placebo.>Are people actually using Night Shift?\n>Aggravatingly, yes.What is the authors problem lol? It feels a lot better on eyeballs to use warm light things. Why does he care?reply",
      "I find it somewhat pleasant, but by far the best thing I did to help my eye strain was greatly lower the brightness.  Basically, I was told to make it so that my phone's camera could see something on the screen and my desk at the same time without washing out.After doing that, I have found that the \"temperature\" of the screen doesn't really matter to me that heavily.reply",
      "> Basically, I was told to make it so that my phone's camera could see something on the screen and my desk at the same time without washing out+1. The low-tech version of this I've heard and I've been doing is:Hold a printed white paper sheet right next to your monitor, and adjust the amount of brightness in monitor so the monitor matches that sheet.This of course requires good overall room lightning where the printed paper would be pleasant to read in first place, whether it's daytime or evening/nightreply",
      "I think this was what I was told the first time.  The advantage of taking a picture with my phone's camera is it kind of made it obvious just how much brighter the screen was then the paper.Which, fair that it may be obvious to others to just scan their eyes from screen to paper.  I've been surprised with how much people will just accept the time their eyes have to adjust to a super bright screen.  Almost like it doesn't register with them.reply",
      "I confirm that this helps me as well. Quite often I don't have any fancy filter, I'm permanently setting display/monitor to low temperature and my eyes/vision couldn't be happier. I don't even need darkmode, regular mode works just fine for me as long as blue light is toned down. Granted, I'm not doing any color correction or anything color sensitive work.I used to have terrible headaches about 20 years ago when I started spending a lot of time in front of the screen. I went to an optometrist who tested my eyes and told me I could get low prescriptions (.5) but warned me that there's no way back and that many people are fine with my current vision, choosing not to get a prescription. Luckily I figured out that it was blue light that was bothering me and once I turned it down I haven't had any problems since. I'm in my mid 40s and my vision has naturally deteriorated a bit but I am still fine with no prescriptions.And I don't believe this to be placebo. Every time I stare at a regular screen for longer than 5 minutes I get eye strain. At the same time I suspect this doesn't help everyone, but at least to me this is a great solution that still works.reply",
      "Can you elaborate on \u201cno way back\u201d?reply",
      "I meant  that once you decide to wear prescription optics you can\u2019t go back to not wearing them, of course excluding  eye surgery. In my case I could stick to good enough vision and luckily 20 years later Im still not wearing glasses. My main point was that I was getting eye strain from blue light and once I reduced it the problem dissapeared.reply"

Those who dislike them don't need further convincing, those who support them are not going to have their opinion changed by property destruction (it might make them support surveillance more, in fact).But hey, it's provocative I guess.On the other hand flock losing their entire fleet is an existential problem for them, and for all the customers they're charging for the use of that fleet.

      "This is not a general purpose chip but specialized for high speed, low latency inference with small context. But it is potentially a lot cheaper than Nvidia for those purposes.Tech summary:  - 15k tok/sec on 8B dense 3bit quant (llama 3.1) \n  - limited KV cache\n  - 880mm^2 die, TSMC 6nm, 53B transistors\n  - presumably 200W per chip\n  - 20x cheaper to produce\n  - 10x less energy per token for inference\n  - max context size: flexible\n  - mid-sized thinking model upcoming this spring on same hardware\n  - next hardware supposed to be FP4 \n  - a frontier LLM planned within twelve months\n\nThis is all from their website, I am not affiliated. The founders have 25 years of career across AMD, Nvidia and others, $200M VC so far.Certainly interesting for very low latency applications which need < 10k tokens context. If they deliver in spring, they will likely be flooded with VC money.Not exactly a competitor for Nvidia but probably for 5-10% of the market.Back of napkin, the cost for 1mm^2 of 6nm wafer is ~$0.20. So 1B parameters need about $20 of die. The larger the die size, the lower the yield. Supposedly the inference speed remains almost the same with larger models.Interview with the founders:\nhttps://www.nextplatform.com/2026/02/19/taalas-etches-ai-mod...reply",
      "This math is useful. Lots of folks scoffing in the comments below. I have a couple reactions, after chatting with it:1) 16k tokens / second is really stunningly fast. There\u2019s an old saying about any factor of 10 being a new science / new product category, etc. This is a new product category in my mind, or it could be. It would be incredibly useful for voice agent applications, realtime loops, realtime video generation, .. etc.2) https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/blogs/H200launch.html Has H200 doing 12k tokens/second on llama 2 12b fb8. Knowing these architectures that\u2019s likely a 100+ ish batched run, meaning time to first token is almost certainly slower than taalas. Probably much slower, since Taalas is like milliseconds.3) Jensen has these pareto curve graphs \u2014 for a certain amount of energy and a certain chip architecture, choose your point on the curve to trade off throughput vs latency. My quick math is that these probably do not shift the curve. The 6nm process vs 4nm process is likely 30-40% bigger, draws that much more power, etc; if we look at the numbers they give and extrapolate to an fp8 model (slower), smaller geometry (30% faster and lower power) and compare 16k tokens/second for taalas to 12k tokens/s for an h200, these chips are in the same ballpark curve.However, I don\u2019t think the H200 can reach into this part of the curve, and that does make these somewhat interesting. In fact even if you had a full datacenter of H200s already running your model, you\u2019d probably buy a bunch of these to do speculative decoding - it\u2019s an amazing use case for them; speculative decoding relies on smaller distillations or quants to get the first N tokens sorted, only when the big model and small model diverge do you infer on the big model.Upshot - I think these will sell, even on 6nm process, and the first thing I\u2019d sell them to do is speculative decoding for bread and butter frontier models. The thing that I\u2019m really very skeptical of is the 2 month turnaround. To get leading edge geometry turned around on arbitrary 2 month schedules is .. ambitious. Hopeful. We could use other words as well.I hope these guys make it! I bet the v3 of these chips will be serving some bread and butter API requests, which will be awesome.reply",

To get leading edge geometry turned around on arbitrary 2 month schedules is .. ambitious. Hopeful. We could use other words as well.The real product they have is automation. They figured out a way to compile a large model into a circuit. That's, in itself, pretty impressive. If they can do this, they can also compile models to an HDL and deploy them to large FPGA simulators for quick validation. If we see models maturing at a \"good enough\" state, even a longer turnaround between model release and silicon makes sense.While I also see lots of these systems running standalone, I think they'll really shine combined with more flexible inference engines, running the unchanging parts of the model while the coupled inference engine deals with whatever is too new to have been baked into silicon.I'm concerned with the environmental impact. Chip manufacture is not very clean and these chips will need to be swapped out and replaced at a cadence higher than we currently do with GPUs.reply",

Interactions with language models lag far behind the pace of human cognition. Coding assistants can ponder for minutes, disrupting the programmer\u2019s state of flow, and limiting effective human-AI collaboration. Meanwhile, automated agentic AI applications demand millisecond latencies, not leisurely human-paced responses.On the cost front, deploying modern models demands massive engineering and capital: room-sized supercomputers consuming hundreds of kilowatts, with liquid cooling, advanced packaging, stacked memory, complex I/O, and miles of cables.
