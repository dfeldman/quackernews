      "I would say the compiler explorer[0] fits the definition perfectly. It may seem like a straightforward piece of software, but it has immensely changed the way people discuss and share knowledge around compilers and performance optimization.I regularly feel the impact on the quality of forum discussions. There's a lot less speculation about if \"call X gets inlined\", or \"Y gets vectorized\". Bold claims can be supported or disproven quickly by sharing a link. And then you have tools like llvm-mca[1] or uiCA[2], if you don't mind going into the weeds.[0] https://godbolt.org/[1] https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-mca.html[2] https://uica.uops.info/",
      "along those lines, the entire notion of a web playground (a sandbox where users can just write and execute or otherwise process code) has vastly reduced the barrier for checking out a project or experimenting with its behaviour",
      "> I couldn\u2019t fathom why anyone would use Windows\u00b2I saw this sentence, was about to type something in response, and then I expanded the footnote (side note: is it really a 'foot'note if it's not in the footer of the page?):> I became significantly more tolerant since my early university years. Windows (specifically the NT family) is a great operating system. I even have it installed on my gaming pc so that I can buy games I never play.It's pretty rare to see such a balanced perspective with respect to Windows when someone starts off with 'UNIX'.",
      "Pedantry: it feels like false balance.Windows is fine, that's it. I use it every day, but it's got so many weird quirks that (that I can't do anything about, being the difference with Linux) it seems ridiculous to call it \"great\".I'm in the other room from my windows laptop. It's late, there's almost nothing running in it, the lid is closed, surprise surprise I can still hear the fans.",
      "> From that moment on, unix followed me through all stages of my life: the toddler phase of keeping up with the cutting-edge Ubuntu releases, the rebellious teens of compiling custom kernels for my Thinkpad T61p and emerging the @world on Gentoo, the maturity of returning to Ubuntu lts and delaying upgrades until the first dot one release, and to the overwhelmed parent stage of becoming a happy macOS user.I started off as a Linux zealot and followed a very similar trajectory. I think it\u2019s a sign of maturity to realize there is no absolute \u201cbest\u201d in engineering, just a best solution in a particular problem space, and Windows is the best for a large number of users for a reason.",
      "Docker is one of these tools for me.The unspeakable amount of my time and headache it saved during my consulting career puts a smile on my face.Docker allows me to quickly iterate over the steps required to run ancient projects.Not having to install 5 different relational database servers on my host OS alone is worth the learning curve.Also crucial for running concurrent, reproducible, Python environments in my laptop.",
      "While it takes heavily from the UI, podman with user namespaces enabled is the completion of this idea for me.No more sudo requirements, greatly reduced attack surface, isolation as a \"user\" concern. It sits happily in my UI doing exactly what I need it to do for all these use cases.",
      "> I also must confess to a strong bias against the fashion for reusable code. To me, \"re-editable code\" is much, much better than an untouchable black box or toolkit.I had never come across this particular thought by Knuth, but this hits home so hard.It feels that most of our productivity is a function of how re-editable the code is in the codebase we operate.It\u2019s intriguing to think about what makes code re-editable vs simply reusable.",
      "Doubt anyone will be surprised by this from me, but, Nix, 1000x. The amount of crazy stuff you can make work with Nix and Nixpkgs is nuts. This weekend someone pinged me wanting a static build of a Rust binary that had some gnarly bindings to C++ libraries. In under 100 lines of Nix, we have everything: static musl-based build, dynamic glibc build. Want an AppImage? `nix bundle` with an AppImage bundler. Want an OCI image? dockerTools.buildImage on top of your derivation. Throw it in GitHub actions using the Determinate Nix Installer action and you get automatic caching of the Nix store using GitHub actions cache; pretty useful since neither musl Rust nor static LLVM are cached in Hydra. Want to share your cache? Pipe a list of Nix store paths to Cachix, then they can pull it down, or add the Cachix GitHub action to automatically pull from and/or push to it for the CI build. So if anyone wanted to re-use your cache from GitHub Actions CI runs, they could, provided they trust you. You can even cross-compile with MinGW, or run it on macOS.It's a hugely complex time sink, but my God, it's great. Whereas I don't generally recommend people go down the NixOS rabbit hole unless they're convinced it's right for them, I definitely think Nix is worth having in your toolbelt, it's ridiculously versatile.",
      "Nix is one of the reasons open source wins in the long run. I would have never imagined that package dependencies could be installed and managed across programming language boundaries, kernel boundaries, shell boundaries, dotfile boundaries etc.Given that computer complexity grows exponentially all the time, then at some point everyone will be forced to use something like Nix.I agree with the article with Emacs and Unix/Linux."

      "> To conclude, we can never automate the construction (nor the testing) of computer programs. So says logic and so says the theory of computation.On the other hand, the strong Church-Turing thesis is that nothing is more powerful than a Turing machine when it comes to solving halting problems, including humans. This is not proven or really provable but it seems more likely than not (humans certainly don't seem especially good at solving halting problems in general).If the Church-Turing thesis is true (at least as applied to humans), discovering valid, halting programs by heuristic using a machine isn't barred by the halting problem as far as I can tell.In other words, humans almost certainly aren't solving halting problems when they program, why should computers necessarily have to? Humans mess up and produce programs that don't halt or don't produce the output they expect all the time, but we still produce useful programs at least sometimes, even if we can't know for sure which programs are which.",
      "Exactly.I'm very surprised someone a whole essay like this and have this misconception.I was half expecting to see \"humans building something smarter than human machines violates the laws of thermodynamics\" next.",
      "Came here to write this, was glad to see it's already here.All the limits that exist for computing machines almost certainly exist for us too; we don't need to solve the halting problem; we don't solve large NP-hard problems; etc.Of course, if one believes there's something mystical about brains -- whether a soul or access to quantum computing -- perhaps one would disagree.",
      "The section \"Forget the Theory of Computation, AI will Soon Replace Programmers\" feels as if it's missing a practical slant that explains this trend. I think approaching it from a purely theoretical perspective misses the relationship between real software and real problems.First: most practical problems are computable, and most practical programs do not run forever. Even if an agent had to run a program to termination, it could still use the feedback gathered from running it to make modifications.Second: an agent with a sufficiently good intermediate representation _which is computable_ doesn't need to actually execute a program to model its behavior. Humans do this all the time--we can read code and understand its approximate function as a means to edit it. I don't want to claim that LLMs have a concept of \"understanding,\" but they definitely build an intermediate representation which, when combined with external input (e.g. having to kill a program, because it exceeded a timeout), can be used to modify the program.Now with all of that said: I don't feel confident about whether or not AI is actually serious risk to programmers, I just don't feel as if this argument is sufficiently compelling.",
      "It's a ridiculous argument that seems to imply that humans can't code either.",
      "People in the comments started to attack the author's argument about halting problem, which I agree isn't the best one, but what about other arguments? They are not less damning for the current technology.",
      "> Automatically discovering formal (i.e., unambiguous) solutions to novel problems can never be automated.Things like alphafold would suggest to me that this doesn\u2019t always hold true.Perhaps a matter of definition but to me there does seem to be \u201csome\u201d problem solving ability. And once you\u2019ve got even a little of that then it\u2019s a scaling question and not really compatible with \u201c can never be automated.\u201d",
      "I\u2019m not sure the Halting Problem is a compelling argument theoretical reason why AI can\u2019t program.I do see a compelling argument on the limits of LLMs being probabilistic (rather than logic/symbolic), as I\u2019ve seen on GPT/Pilot coming up with code that looks syntactically valid but calls completely made-up APIs.",
      "I don\u2019t see how the author\u2019s arguments about impossibility results pertaining to \u201cdistributed sub-symbolic architectures\u201d apply any more strongly to LLMs or DNNs than they do to human brains.  Human programmers aren\u2019t magically capable of solving the halting problem either, but we muddle through somehow.",

That would take damages off the table for this case.  With no monetary damages, Google thinks that the state has no right to demand a jury trial.They have also said in the article that the amount that Google claims the DOJ can prove is less than $1 million, so there's a chance this is a very small check from Google's perspective.Polling the jury pool is not an uncommon practice in high-stakes trials, and I assume that Google has run a poll of the jury pool and found them hostile enough that they are willing to concede to 7-8 figures to avoid a jury getting involved in the decision whether to break Google up.",

The government can't sue you over an unpaid speeding ticket if you pay the ticket.The reason why this might work is the Seventh Amendment, which guarantees a jury in federal lawsuits so long as the amount disputed is over $20.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Amendment_to_the_Unite...> In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preservedIf Google says \"yep, we're not disputing that we owe the federal govt $1 million, here's a cheque for that amount\", their argument is that the \"value in controversy\" is now $0. Since $0 is less than $20, that clause doesn't apply.I'd like to hear what an actual lawyer has to say on the odds this'll work, though.",
      "I wondered about that $20 amount, and sure enough, from that page:The amendment additionally guarantees a minimum of six members for a jury in a civil trial. The amendment's twenty-dollar threshold has not been the subject of much scholarly or judicial writing and still remains applicable despite the inflation that has occurred since the late 18th century ($20 in 1800 is equivalent to $359 in 2023",
      "The $20+ rule is about guaranteeing a jury trial. If one of the parties and the judge go for it it can still happen right?",
      "> Instead of paying a speeding fine this is like going to the judge and saying here is 100 bucks to pretend the speed limit is 10 mph higher and then we hold the trial under those conditions.Uh isn't that how it works? You plead no contest and pay a fine and don't even have to see the judge?",
      "I think a defendant can ask for a judge to decide instead of a jury."

      "Uber must have picked up some Google rejects. This type of homegrown project was seen at Google all the time.Usually to aim for a significant promotion.\u201cDesigned and built homegrown system to save $Xm! Give me promo, bro?\u201dJust so happened to ignore that it took X+Y additional to build. Also it will probably be going to the G graveyard in a few years.",
      "The thing I find odd about this is that the headline figure is about old immutable records. Almost all of that 1.7PB is ancient by what seems to be to by any practical standard. Uber is not likely to care about the credit card authorization flow for a ride two years ago, except maybe for analytics.If I were doing this, I would be looking at data warehousing systems.  1.7PB of, say, Parquet files in S3 is not terribly expensive.  1.7PB of Parquet files in on-prem or collocated object storage, even replicated a zillion times, is quite cheap.  And quite a few companies and open-source projects are currently competing aggressively to provide awesome tools for querying that data.The hot data would fit on basically anything \u2014 the choice should be about robustness and barely even consider cost per TiB.  Datomic got written up recently and seems credible for this type of application. FoundationDB is bulletproof.  Postgres could probably handle it without breaking a sweat, although active/active replication isn\u2019t free.  Heck, writes straight to a warehouse with a cache in front to help with reads seems credible \u2014 Uber rides rarely go for longer than a couple hours, and back-of-the-envelope math suggests that the total data rate is maybe 50GB/hour. An entire day of data for an entire country would fit on a single very ordinary commodity server, and the live data for the entire world would fit on one mildly beefy server.  The indexes involved sound straightforward.",
      "The primary use case is not analytics. This data store is the system of record in their credit card authorization and billing pipeline, and so it has extreme consistency requirements. The lion\u2019s share of its engineering is to provide consistency across a large spectrum of failure modes.Old data could probably live at lower cost in a data warehouse, but then developers would have multiple systems and namespaces to deal with in order to query on transactions.",
      "> This data store is the system of record in their credit card authorization and billing pipeline, and so it has extreme consistency requirements.This seems like an odd requirement to me.  What are the use cases beyond a few minutes past the end of the ride?- Reconciliation of Uber's finances.  This definitely needs to be correct and consistent and maybe even auditable, but it's also done at the end of any given billing period.  A daily roll-up would be sufficient.- Showing each driver and each rider their own history.  This ought to be fully correct (especially for drivers), but it's a massive double-edged sword.  Uber's app, for example, appears to be entirely missing the \"please forget my ride history\" button.  And this isn't surprising: Uber apparently stores it in a ledger, fully indexed, complete since at least 2017, that is cryptographically immutable.  Is this actually a good thing?  What happens when a privacy regulator tells Uber to expunge, anonymize, or pseudonymize old data?- Handling chargebacks?  Having a high quality record going back 180-365 days seems useful.  But the cost to Uber of occasionally losing a record is very low and is barely more than proportional to the probability of loss of a given record.So I don't get it.  If I were running an operation like this, I would prefer not to have a fully immutable ledger full of personally identifiable location, usage, and transactional data.",
      ">This seems like an odd requirement to me. What are the use cases beyond a few minutes past the end of the ride?Exactly what he the OP said, authorization. Card networks cap latency of authorization requests (the time the merchant submits a request, to when it makes its make through the merchant processor, networks, issuer processor and back.)",
      "Which is \u2026normal. Different types of data access have different SLA requirements. Any company that cares about cost will warehouse data after x time frame. It\u2019s done even in banking. Uber has a much more lenient need to make this data instantly available.",
      "> It\u2019s done even in bankingWhat are you basing this on, banks have less real time constraints when it comes to certain data but thats rare. You will almost never see a bank, processor, etc. archive their system of record data.",
      "Immutable data is always consistent. This is almost certainly an append-only ledger, a well-established solution for a simple problem.",
      "I'm not sure if this is true of modern Google. Certainly there are a ton of custom things around, but it also seems like in the last 5 years there has been a huge push towards not re-inventing more databases/etc, and normalising everything onto a few core technologies. A good example is Spanner, many products have been moved off other home-grown systems onto Spanner, basically to reduce complexity and cost. Sure Spanner is a Google technology, but at least it's one, instead of having all sorts of different esoteric systems, and Spanner is just one example, this is happening in a number of different domains.",
      "I heard from some X-Uber people that you could call Uber a database company as much as you could call it a transportation company. Something like 80+ databases invented there in one form or another.Promotion-driven development. I suppose better than blog post driven development, but marginally so."
