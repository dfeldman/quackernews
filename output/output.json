      "> Meanwhile, evolving resistance also comes at a cost.  We don\u2019t know that directly, but we can infer it pretty well. If resistance to tetrodotoxin were cheap and easy, everything would evolve it. [..] We don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re pretty sure there must be something.  We know that garter snakes outside of the Pacific Northwest are much less resistant to tetrodotoxin. They\u2019ll drop dead from doses that their Oregon cousins simply ignore.  So evolving the resistance must have some cost or drawback.I'm not so sure that's really the case; it's more that for many animals there simply isn't any pressure to evolve (or retain) this trait.It's not like the natural selection process has a feature list it can tick off. It operates with zero foresight and an incredibly dumb principle: whatever helps procreation.Cows are not dying due to tetrodotoxin poisoning in significant numbers, as far as I know, so there is no reason for them to evolve resistance to it. The same applies to most animals, including the snakes outside that area.Your dog can synthesise their own vitamin C and will never develop scurvy. Most animals can do this \u2013 humans and some other primates are the exception. An ancestor lost the trait for vitamin C synthesis by chance, and because these primates were living in trees eating lots of fruit with vitamin C, evolution simply didn't notice. There is no disadvantage to being able to synthesise vitamin C, and no advantage in dropping the trait. It didn't affect procreation (at the time). Now we're all stuck with it.Now, maybe all of this does have a cost for the snakes. But it's far from a given that there is one.\n \nreply",
      "I think it might be more useful to look at the author's claim from the other side of the lense. We do carry around barely useful traits, like resistance to toxins that we seldom come in contact with. We can assume that carrying such traits is cheap. If resistance to tetrodotoxin was one such cheap trait, it might have been more prevalent, but it's not so, it could be inferred that it's expensive. Or at least, not cheap.\n \nreply",
      "This is another case of a huge fallacy humans seem endlessly afflicted with: The Root Cause Fallacy.You are assuming there is but one cause for development and/or loss of resistance.There may not be much pressure to develop resistance to tetrodotoxin for most species. Simultaneously there might be a higher metabolic cost to retaining it for some species but not for others. It is also possible that resistance with low cost is very rarely lost which is why we carry resistance to toxins we don't often see but population bottlenecks in ancestral lines can cause loss of a trait to propagate - even by accident. And much like Vitamin C loss if it doesn't matter the loss sticks. We should not forget that there are multiple resistance mechanisms as well: an immune system generally primed to fight certain common causes of mortality can, entirely by accident, also be primed to recognize and destroy certain proteins conferring resistance to some toxins and not others.I have barely scratched the surface above. The random walk of evolution and its constant hoarding tendencies should make everyone skeptical simplistic mechanisms of action as well as \"just so\" explanations of evolutionary history.FWIW most things are multi-causal. I previously made the same argument about house prices. People who claim it is caused by foreign money, low interest rates, restrictive zoning, etc all want their pet theory to be The One True Reason. In reality the market is complex and many of the proposed causes are merely contributing factors.\n \nreply",
      "> You are assuming...I made no assumptions. As I pointed out to another commenter, you might be in too much of a haste to play at being a contrarian. It might be more useful to pay closer attention to what you're objecting to.Evolutionary game theory demonstrates that evolution is a matter of fitness payoffs. If cost of a trait increases, fitness is reduced. The prevalence of a trait in a fit population is indicative that, at best, the trait increases fitness, at worst, it doesn't hinder it. In both cases, the genes tend to be passed on and the game is allowed to continue. When carrying the trait becomes costly, there's pressure to get rid of it (through the usual evolutionary means).The above model encompasses all the unnecessary specificity you tried to bring into the matter. If you object to it, address your concerns to the scientists that are leading us all astray.For now, let's circle right back to the author's original argument. Absence of an actually useful trait to increase fitness (i.e. protecting ones from certain food sources and others from predators) might be indicative of a hefty tax to pay for carrying it.\n \nreply",
      "That resistance to toxins we don't encounter often enough to constitute selective pressure, we carry around only if it's the accidental byproduct of another selected-for trait.  Otherwise entropy would take care of it, sooner or later.  Parent is right, evolution doesn't pay an annual  subscription fee for some service which was useful in the past and might come in handy in the future.\n \nreply",
      "You may just be trying to disagree with the author for sport.> we carry around only...Not true. We can carry resistance to some ancestral pressure which isn't part of the current environment.> sooner or later...Yes, sooner when it's costly, later when it's less so, through normal evolutionary pressure (entropy and all).The point is, most species at time T do carry traits that aren't that useful to them anymore. The costlier ones yield enough negative fitness points in evolutionary game theory to rid the gene pool of them quicker. It brings us right back to the author's original argument.\n \nreply",
      "It\u2019s not some binary thing but degrees of adaptation.People can handle significantly more of a wide range of plant toxins like theobromine and caffeine (both found in chocolate) which harm  more pure predators like dogs in very low doses, but where rare for out imitate ancestors.Cattle, deer etc however can handle many of those at much higher doses.\n \nreply",
      "Not wrong, but one could frame that as a \"cost\" that you pay in the space of genealogical problem solving. Having one less constraint makes it easier to adapt to other evolutionary pressures\n \nreply",
      "I omitted some bits from the quote for brevity and HN's faux-quoting sucks, but that's not really the type of \"cost\" the article is talking about: \"maybe they\u2019re suffering from much more subtle neurological effects, like being prone to insomnia or hallucinations or sexual dysfunction. Or maybe they\u2019re just a bit dim.\"\n \nreply",

      "\"There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.\"-Leo Breiman, like 24 years agoMachine learning isn't the native language of biology, the author just realized that there's more than one approach to modeling. I'm a statistician working in an ML role and most of the issues I run into (from a modeling perspective) are the reverse of what this article describes - people trying to use ML for the precise things inferential statistics and mechanistic models are designed for. Not that the distinction is that clear to begin with.\n \nreply",
      "The problem with this machine-learned \u201cpredictive biology\u201d framework is that it doesn\u2019t have any prescription for what to do when your predictions fail. Just collect more data! What kind of data? As the author notes, the configuration space of biology is effectively infinite so it matters a great deal what you measure and how you measure it. If you don\u2019t think about this (or your model can\u2019t help you think about it) you\u2019re unlikely to observe the conditions where your predictions are incorrect. That\u2019s why other modeling approaches care about tedious things like physics and causality. They let you constrain the model to conditions you\u2019ve observed and hypothesize what missing, unobserved factors might be influencing your system.It\u2019s also a bit arrogant in presuming that no other approaches to modeling cells cared about \u201cprediction\u201d. Of course, systems and mathematical biologists care about making accurate predictions, they just also care about other things like understanding molecular interactions *because that lets you make better predictions*Not to be cynical but this seems like an attempt to export benchmark culture from ML into bio. I think that blindly maximizing test set accuracy is likely to lead down a lot dead end paths. I say this as someone actively doing ML for bio research.\n \nreply",
      "Look, we're all going to sit around cringing until someone says it; machine learning is explicitly the natural language of computers. In nature, neurons are not arranging themselves into neat unsigned 8-bit integers to quantize themselves for recollection. They're also networked by synapses and reactive biology, not feedforward algorithms scanning static, hereditary weights.This whole thing feels like the author is familiar with one set of abstractions but not the other. It's very reminiscent of the (intensely fallible) Chomsky logic that leads to insane extrapolations about what biology is or isn't. Machine learning is a model, and all models are wrong.\n \nreply"

That's the deal on paper, I'm wondering if you got any real data on this.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks! The SCD30 is a great sensor and obviously better than the SCD41. But we did not look at it in more detail, as we chose the SCD41 primarily for its small size. We believe that an accuracy of +/-50ppm is enough for a device like the Air Lab. Also, we'll actively look into reminding the user to take the device outside if automatic calibration is used. On top of that, it's our plan to either factory calibrate the devices and/or offer manual recalibration that should extend beyond the 1-week interval with automatic calibration.\n \nreply",

Air quality is the worst in poorer regions of the world, and as someone who suffers from horrible air pollution, but who's also living a relatively cushy life (by our standards), I can assure you that $200+ for an air quality sensor puts it into the \"unobtainable\" bucket. Add shipping and it probably gets closer to $300, which is roughly equal to the median monthly salary over here.Your NO\u2082 measurements make it a really interesting device compared to most alternatives that only measure particulate matter.

If that's too much, you might be able to make it cheaper by downloading the KiCad and STL files off their website [1], getting PCBs printed elsewhere, 3D printing the case, and sourcing the rest of the parts from aliexpress. When you do it that way, you can also omit any sensors that are not of interest to save money, and perhaps add them in later.[1] https://www.airgradient.com/documentation/overview/\n \nreply",

      "So these are popping up everywhere, then?I have two within five miles of my house.  They've both been there over a year, probably a bit longer.  I'm in a mid-western US suburb, mostly blue-colllar/manufacturing employers around here.  And there's a \"Red Tag\" store (similar) which is very obviously trying to pass off that they sell Target returns/over-stock.  It's across the street from -- surprise -- a Target!Of the two \"bin\" stores, nearby, one is much larger/newer.  The bigger one starts off at $7 on Saturday at noon, dropping to a buck by the following Friday.  There is a loooooong line.  I think they started selling memberships or something along those lines to let you have the first spots in said line (or maybe get in a little early).  They sell other, higher-dollar items, but I've walked out of there on a Saturday with a portable pump for $7 that was selling for $60 on Amazon (it was worth about $20 IMHO).  There's a reason people line up.They also sell $35 random (sealed) boxes (and I think you can buy 4 for $100 or some kind of arrangement like that).  I've never seen the contents of these boxes.  It looks like most of these businesses stock returns from, mostly, Amazon but also others which they buy in lots.  I'm not sure the mechanics of it but I'm sure another comment has an explanation by now.Searching \"Surplus\" on Google Maps surfaced the two I found (with identical models) as well as one an hour away that didn't do the \"bin\" arrangement, but dealt in larger items.  I purchased an ultra-wide monitor for $400, there (about $350 off the best price when I bought it).Personally, I love these spots.  There is such a massive stock of returns that you can almost rely on showing up at one of these places and having a pretty good chance of finding what you need, it just takes a little more effort.\n \nreply",
      "We've had The Goodwill Outlet store (aka \"The Bins\" ) in the Portland area for about 25 years now. Maybe a bit different, they sell all of the stuff that doesn't sell in the other area Goodwill stores by the pound. It's all dumped in large bins. During the Tech Wreck when I was unemployed I'd go to The Bins when they opened and go through the book bins grabbing what I thought I could sell used on Amazon... Goodwill got wise to that after about 6 months and stared pulling books out that they could sell online. But for about 6 months there we paid the bills by selling books I bought by the pound at the bins.Anyway, The Bins has a unique culture. There's The Changing of The Bins - that happens when they take out the most picked over bins and replace them with fresh bins full of stuff.

When people then buy the item and realise that it's garbage, it gets tossed. Just maybe you can't make a good air-fryer for $50, but people will see it and think \"For $50 I can give it a go\". They then conclude that it's rubbish and take it to the junk yard.No, most of this stuff should never have been made in the first place. We need to stop making products that has to hit a price point, regardless of quality. We need to stop making one-time-use novelty items.Then you have the secondary effect: Some clever business people sees this trend and starts ordering junk in bulk on Wish, AliExpress or Temu, dumps it in big boxes with a few good items (maybe) and starts their own \"fake\" Bin Store.\n \nreply",

I look forward to poking around in it. However I have a little bit of a hang-up with calling it a \u201ctree\u201d. Namely, a tree conjures the image of it being a 1-to-N graph, i.e. a single idea leads to several new ones, and so on, when it is very much not.Ironically Connections was really what rammed this point home for me. It really is more like a social media graph, where ideas from all over, old and new, coalesce into a new epiphany that leads to a new invention.

Like, if not for the random placement of smart people in the right places, who's to say we might not have started launching rockets 500 years ago, or 500 years from now? And how disjoint can branches of a a tech tree really be; are there branches of our tree that could conceivably be completely dark ages and undiscovered given where we are in the other branches? But it's the first question that is most fun: have we ever been externally gated, like where a certain idea or technology was just completely impossible to invent discover until something external happened like a meteor hitting the ground, or a volcano erupting, etc?\n \nreply",
      "Energy and materials. In particular, discovery and exploitation of hydrocarbons changed the entire trajectory of human technology development.It is very interesting to wonder if we may have seen \"convergent evolution\" towards certain technologies with different physical circumstances, but I think it's safe to say our species' (and planet's) future is forever altered by the massive biogeochemical battery, trickle-charged over eons, which we are discharging as rapidly as possible.\n \nreply",

Fossil fuels have been around longer than humanity, and the earliest human usage of them was prehistoric:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_coal_mining#Early_h...The oldest intentional use of black coal was documented in Ostrava, Pet\u0159kovice, in a settlement from the older Stone Age on the top of Landek Hill. According to radiocarbon dating, the site falls within the period 25,000\u201323,000 years BC.The Industrial Revolution wasn't when people first learned about fossil fuels, but it was when we started turning heat into mechanical work at scale.\n \nreply"

This doesn't mean HyperDX is going away by any means - just that HyperDX is focused a lot more on the end-user experience, and we get to leverage the flexibility, learnings and performance of a more exposed ClickHouse-powered core which is the intent of ClickStack.

I wouldn't care if it breaks some enterprise apps or integrations - enterprises could reenable this \"feature\" via management tools, normal users could configure it themselves, just show a popup \"this website wants to control local devices - allow/deny\".\n \nreply",
      "This is a misunderstanding. Local network devices are protected from random websites by CORS, and have been for many years. It's not perfect, but it's generally quite effective.The issue is that CORS gates access only on the consent of the target server. It must return headers that opt into receiving requests from the website.This proposal aims to tighten that, so that even if the website and the network device both actively want to communicate, the user's permission is also explicitly requested. Historically we assumed server & website agreement was sufficient, but Facebook's recent tricks where websites secretly talked to apps on your phone have broken that assumption - websites might be in cahoots with local network servers to work against your interests.\n \nreply",

      "Unfortunately, the initial WebSocket HTTP request is defined to always be a GET request.\n \nreply",
      "Doesn't CORS just restrict whether the webpage JS context gets to see the response of the target request? The request itself happens anyway, right?So the attack vector that I can imagine is that JS on the browser can issue a specially crafted request to a vulnerable printer or whatever that triggers arbitrary code execution on that other device. That code might be sufficient to cause the printer to carry out your evil task, including making an outbound connection to the attacker's server. Of course, the webpage would not be able to discover whether it was successful, but that may not be important.\n \nreply",
      "I think CORS is so hard for us to hold in our heads in large part due to how much is stuffed into the algorithm.It may send an OPTIONS request, or not.It may block a request being sent (in response to OPTIONS) or block a response from being read.It may restrict which headers can be set, or read.It may downgrade the request you were sending silently, or consider your request valid but the response off limits.It is a matrix of independent gates essentially.Even the language we use is imprecise, CORS itself is not really doing any of this or blocking things. As others pointed out it\u2019s the Single Origin Policy that is the strict one, and CORS is really an exception engine to allow us to punch through that security layer.\n \nreply"
