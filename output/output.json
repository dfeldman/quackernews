      "(Pydantic AI lead here) That\u2019s exactly what we built this for: we\u2019re implementing Code Mode in https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/4153 which will use Monty by default, with abstractions to use other runtimes / sandboxes.Monty\u2019s overhead is so low that, assuming we get the security / capabilities tradeoff right (Samuel can comment on this more), you could always have it enabled on your agents with basically no downsides, which can\u2019t be said for many other code execution sandboxes which are often over-kill for the code mode use case anyway.For those not familiar with the concept, the idea is that in \u201ctraditional\u201d LLM tool calling, the entire (MCP) tool result is sent back to the LLM, even if it just needs a few fields, or is going to pass the return value into another tool without needing to see (all of) the intermediate value. Every step that depends on results from an earlier step requires a new LLM turn, limiting parallelism and adding a lot of overhead, expensive token usage, and context window bloat.With code mode, the LLM can chain tool calls, pull out specific fields, and run entire algorithms using tools with only the necessary parts of the result (or errors) going back to the LLM.These posts by Cloudflare: https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/ and Anthropic: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-us... explain the concept and its advantages in more detail.reply",

The Effect library gave me proper Error types and immutable data types and the Bun Shell makes writing shell commands in TS nearly as easy as Bash.

      "> I kept finding myself using a small amount of the features while the rest just mostly got in the way. So a few years ago I set out to build a design tool just like I wanted. So I built Vecti with what I actually need...Joel Spolsky said (I'm paraphrasing) that everybody only uses 20% of a given program's features, but the problem is that everyone is using a different 20%, so you can't ship an \"unbloated\" version and expect it to still work for most people.So it looks like you've built something really cool, but I have to ask what makes you think that the features that are personally important to you are the same features that other potential users need? Since this clearly seems to be something you're trying to create a business out of rather than just a personal hobby project. I'm curious how you went about customer research and market validation for the specific subset of features that you chose to develop?reply",

      "This is the best way to build products imo. I'm like this, and I've been accused of being very \"vibes-based.\" However, that's a way more tractable way of shipping stuff instead of \"well Jim said he wants X, but Amy said she wants Y\" so you end up just kind of half-assing features because you think they might get you users, instead of just being passionately all-in into a very defined product vision (which is a very Jobsian way of doing things).It's also easier to run a feedback loop. If you implement Y, but Amy doesn't give you $5 a month, what are you going to do? Knock on her door? Users have no idea what they want half the time, anyway.If you build a product and no one cares, it bruises the ego a bit more, sure, but if you self reflect, you can eek out your own bad assumptions, or bad implementation, or maybe a way to pivot that keeps your product ethos.reply",

      "This website is such a treasure. When I was first getting into bicycles in 2013, it was a mix of Sheldon Brown and the local volunteer-run co-op that taught me everything I need to know. He is himself a generous spirit, advocating for DIY tooling, repair, and reuse.I would highly recommend anyone into bicycles to try building their own wheel using his article.reply",

      "As somebody whose first day working at Heroku was the day this acquisition closed, I think it\u2019s mostly a misconception to blame Salesforce for Heroku\u2019s stagnation and eventual irrelevance. Salesforce gave Heroku a ton of funding to build out a vision that was way ahead of its time. Docker didn\u2019t even come out until 2013, AWS didn\u2019t even have multiple regions when it was built. They mostly served as an investor and left us alone to do our thing, or so it seemed those first couple years.The launch of the multi language Cedar runtime in 2011 led to incredible growth and by 2012 we were drowning in tech debt and scaling challenges. Despite more than tripling our headcount in that first year (~20 to 74) we could not keep up.Mid 2012 was especially bad as we were severely impacted by two us-east-1 outages just 2 weeks apart. To the extent it wasn\u2019t already, reliability and paying down tech debt became the main focus and I think we went about 18 months between major user-facing platform launches (Europe region and eventually larger sized dynos being the biggest things we eventually shipped after that drought). The organization lost its ability to ship significant changes or maybe never really had that ability at scale.That time coincided with the founders taking a step back, leaving a loss of leadership and vision that was filled by people more concerned with process than results. I left in 2014 and at that time it already seemed clear to me that the product was basically stalled.I\u2019m not sure how much of this could have been done better even in hindsight. In theory Salesforce could have taken a more hands on approach early on but I don\u2019t think that could have ended better. They were so far from profitability in late 2010 that they could not stay independent without raising more funding. The venture market in ~2010 was much smaller than a few years later\u2014tiny rounds and low valuations. Had the company spent its pre-acquisition engineering cycles building for scalability & reliability at the expense of product velocity they probably would have never gotten successful.Even still, it was the most amazing professional experience of my career, full of brilliant and passionate people, and it\u2019s sad to see it end this way.reply",
      "It remains the greatest engineering team I've ever seen or had the pleasure to be a part of. I was only there from early 2011 to mid 2012 but what I took with me changed me as an engineer. The shear brilliance of the ideas and approaches...I was blessed to witness it. I don't think I can overstate it, though many will think this is all hyperbole. I didn't always agree with the decisions made and I was definitely there when the product stagnation started, but we worked hard to reduce tech debt, build better infrastructure, and improve... but man, the battles we fought. Many fond memories, including the single greatest engineering mistake I've ever seen made, one that I still think about until this day (but will never post in a public forum :)).It was a pleasure working with you bgentry!reply",
      "Thanks for sharing your story. Those early days of using Heroku were really enjoyable for me. It felt so promising and simple. I remember explaining the concept to a lot of different people who didn't believe that the deployment model could be that simple and accessible until I showed them.Then life went on, I bounced around in my career, and forgot about Heroku. Years later I actually suggested it for someone to use for a simple project once and I could practically feel the other developers in the room losing respect for me for even mentioning it. I hadn't looked at it for so long that I didn't realize it had fallen out of favor.> That time coincided with the founders taking a step back, leaving a loss of leadership and vision that was filled by people more concerned with process than resultsThis feels all too familiar. All of my enjoyable startup experiences have ended this way: The fast growing, successful startup starts attracting people who look like they should be valuable assets to the company, but they're more interested in things like policies, processes, meetings, and making the status reports look nice than actually shipping and building.reply",

      "I am a solution engineer mostly on the traditional ML side of things but have good knowledge of K8S/GKE. The most fun I had last year was helping a customer serve their models at scale. They thought it was cost prohibitive (500k inferences/second and a hard requirement of 7ms at p99) and so they were basically serving from a cache which was lossy (the combinatorial explosion of features made it so that to have full coverage you needed exabytes of ram) and was stale prone. We focused on the serving first. After their data scientists trained a New pytorch model (small one, 50k parameters more or less) we compiled to onnx (as the model is small and CPU inference is actually faster), grafted the preprocessing layers to the model so that you never leave the ONNX C++ runtime (to avoid python), and deployed it to GKE. A 8 core node using AMD genoa cpus managed to get 25k/inferences per second. After a bit of fiddling with Numa affinity, GKE DNS replication, Triton LRU caches and few other things we managed to hit 30k inferences per second. If you scale up to the traffic it would cost them few thousands per month, which is less than their original cache approach.Now they are working on continuous learning so that they can roll out new model (it is a very adversarial line of business and the models get stale in O(hours)). For that part I only helped them design the thing, no hands on. It was a super fun engagement TBHreply",

      "The post touches very briefly on linting in 7. For me, setting up a large number of static code analysis checks has had the highest impact on code quality.My hierarchy of static analysis looks like this (hierarchy below is Typescript focused but in principle translatable to other languages):1. Typesafe compiler (tsc)2. Basic lint rules (eslint)3. Cyclomatic complexity rules (eslint, sonarjs)4. Max line length enforcement (via eslint)5. Max file length enforcement (via eslint)6. Unused code/export analyser (knip)7. Code duplication analyser (jscpd)8. Modularisation enforcement (dependency-cruiser)9. Custom script to ensure shared/util directories are not over stuffed (built this using dependency-cruiser as a library rather than an exec)10. Security check (semgrep)I stitch all the above in a single `pnpm check` command and defined an agent rule to run this before marking task as complete.Finally, I make sure `pnpm check` is run as part of a pre-commit hook to make sure that the agent has indeed addressed all the issues.This makes a dramatic improvement in code quality to the point where I'm able to jump in and manually modify the code easily when the LLM slot machine gets stuck every now and then.(Edit: added mention of pre-commit hook which I missed mention of in initial comment)reply",
      "My setup has some of the things mentioned and I found that occasionally the LLM will lie that something passes, when it doesn't.reply",
      "Yup I have run into the same.I use a pre-commit hook to run `pnpm check`. I missed mentioning it in the original comment. Your reply reminded me of it and I have now added it. Thanks.reply",
      "I wonder at the end of this if it's the still worth the risk?A lot of how I form my thoughts is driven by writing code, and seeing it on screen, running into its limitations.Maybe it's the kind of work I'm doing, or maybe I just suck, but the code to me is a forcing mechanism into ironing out the details, and I don't get that when I'm writing a specification.reply",
      "Historically software engineering has been seen as \"assembly line\" work by a lot of people (see all the efforts to outsource it through spec handoffs and waterfall through the years) but been implemented in practice as design-as-you-build (nobody anticipates all the questions or edge cases in advance, software specs are often an order of magnitude simpler than the actual number of branches in the code).For mission-critical applications I wonder if making \"writing the actual code\" so much cheaper means that it would make more sense to do more formal design up front instead, when you no longer have a human directly in the loop during the writing of the code to think about those nasty pops-up-on-the-fly decisions.reply",
      "I second this. This* is the matter against which we form understanding. This here is the work at hand, our own notes, discussions we have with people, the silent walk where our brain kinda process errors and ideas .. it's always been like this since i was a kid, playing with construction toys. I never ever wanted somebody to play while I wait to evaluate if it fits my desires. Desires that often come from playing.Outsourcing this to an LLM is similar to an airplane stall .. I just dip mentally. The stress goes away too, since I assume the LLM will get rid of the \"problem\" but I have no more incentives to think, create, solve anything.Still blows my mind how different people approach some fields. I see people at work who are drooling about being able to have code made for them .. but I'm not in that group.reply",
      "I'll push it back against this a little bit. I find any type of deliberative thinking to be a forcing function.  I've recently been experimenting with writing very detailed specifications and prompts for an LLM to process. I find that as I go through the details, thoughts will occur to me. Things I hadn't thought about in the design will come to me. This is very much the same phenomenon when I was writing the code by hand.  I don't think this is a binary either or. There are many ways to have a forcing function.reply",
      "I think it's analogous to writing and refining an outline for a paper. If you keep going, you eventually end up at an outline where you can concatenate what are basically sentences together to form paragraphs. This is sort of where you are now, if you spec well you'll get decent results.reply",
      "I agree, I felt this a bit. The LLM can be a modeling peer in a way. But the phase where it goes to validate / implement is also key to my brain. I need to feel the details.reply",

      "The observation that concatenative programming languages have nearly ideal properties for efficient universal learning on silicon is very old. You can show that the resource footprint required for these algorithms to effectively learn a programming language is much lower than other common types of programming models. There is a natural mechanical sympathy with the theory around universal learning. It was my main motivation to learn concatenative languages in the 1990s.This doesn't mean you should write AI in these languages, just that it is unusually cheap and easy for AI to reason about code written in these languages on silicon.reply",

      "I have just spent a month writing about 2000 lines of Forth. My answer is no, at least w/r to generating something that looks like the by-hand code I wrote. LLMs coast by on being able to reproduce idiomatic syntax and having other forms of tooling(type checkers, linters, unit tests, etc.) back them up.But Forth taken holistically is a do-anything-anytime imperative language, not just \"concatenative\" or \"postfix\". It has a stack but the stack is an implementation detail, not a robust abstraction. If you want to do larger scale things you don't pile more things on the stack, you start doing load and store and random access, inventing the idioms as you go along to load more and store more. This breaks all kinds of tooling models that rely on robust abstractions with compiler-enforced boundaries. I briefly tested to see what LLMs would do with it and gave up quickly because it was a complete rewrite every single time.Now, if we were talking about a simplistic stack machine it might be more relevant, but that wouldn't be the same model of computation.reply",
      "Even though I really like postfix from an elegance standpoint, and I use an RPN calculator, IMO it's harder to reason about subexpressions with postfix.  Being able to decompose an expression into independent parts is what allows us to understand it.  If you just randomly scan a complex expression in infix, if you see parenthesis or a +, you know that what's outside of the parenthesis or on the other side of a + can't affect the part you're looking at.If you're executing the operations interactively, you're seeing what's happening on the stack, and so it's easy to keep track of where you are, but if you're reading postfix expressions, it's significantly harder.reply",
      "Most models are multi-paradigm, and so they get... Fixated on procedural language design. Concepts like the stack, backtracking, etc. violate the logic they've absorbed, leading to... Burning tokens whilst it corrects itself.This won't show up in a smaller benchmark, because the clutching at straws tends to happen nearer to the edge of the window. The place where you can get it to give up obvious things that don't work, and actually try the problem space you've given.reply",
      "I haven\u2019t tried the extremes. Context rot says it\u2019ll likely degrade there anyway.What I\u2019m investigating is if more compact languages work for querying data.What makes you think it\u2019s going to clutch at straws more? What makes you think it won\u2019t do better with a more compact, localized representation?reply",
      "The claim seems extremely unlikely to me. LLM comprehension is very sophisticated by any metric, the idea that something as trivial as concatenative syntactic structure would make a significant difference is implausible.LLMs handle deeply nested syntax just fine - parentheses and indentation are not the hard part. Linearization is not a meaningful advantage.In fact, it\u2019s much more likely to be a disadvantage, much as it is for humans. Stack effects are implicit, so correct composition requires global reasoning. A single missing dup breaks everything downstream. LLMs, and humans, are much more effective when constraints are named and localized, not implicit and global.reply"
