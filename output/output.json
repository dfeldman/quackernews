      "This is cool, I hope Australia follows suit!Australia's communications regulator, ACMA, has already permitted Wi-Fi 6E devices to operate in the lower 6 GHz band (5925\u20136425 MHz) under the Low Interference Potential Devices (LIPD) Class Licence. This includes low-power indoor (LPI) and very low power (VLP) devices.As for the upper 6 GHz band (6425\u20137125 MHz), ACMA is still evaluating its use. In June 2024, it sought public input on possible applications, including RLANs and wide-area wireless broadband services.So, while unlicensed device operations are allowed in the lower 6 GHz band, the upper band is still under consideration.\n \nreply",

The child, J.F., is autistic and has allegedly exhibited a spiralling trend of aggressive behavior towards his parents which they attribute to the content fed by the Character AI app:> Only then did she discover J.F.\u2019s use of C.AI and the product\u2019s frequent depictions of violent content, including self-harm descriptions, without any adequate safeguards or harm prevention mechanisms. ...> Over the course of his engagement with this app, the responses exhibited a pattern of exploiting this trust and isolating J.F., while normalizing violent, sexual and illicit actions. This relationship building and exploitation is inherent to the ways in which this companion AI chatbot is designed, generating responses to keep users engaged and mimicking the toxic and exploitative content expressed in its training data. It then convinced him that his family did not love him, that only these characters loved him, and that he should take matters into his own hands.Obviously it's hard to tell how cherry picked the complaint is\u2014but it's arguing that this is a pattern that has actually damaged a particularly vulnerable kid's relationship with his family and encouraged him to start harming himself, with this specific message just one example.

      "OK, I mean, yes. Definitely true. But on the other hand, the sudden and satisfactory death of one's parents has been the beginning of many memorable childrens' books, as a device to launch the main character into narrative control, which they would lack with living guardians. Then there is that whole Roald Dahl thing where James kills off his aunts with a large tree fruit.Whether the narrative that you could live a life of fun and adventure if only your parents were dead is \"incitement to parricide\" is I suppose a matter of perception.\n \nreply",

There are a bunch of other screenshots in the complaint that are worth looking over before coming to a conclusion.Conclusion:  Chat bots should not tell children about sex,  about self harm,  or about ways to murder their parents.  This conclusion is not abrogated by the parents actions,  the state of the childs mind,  or by other details in the complaint.Is that the sentiment here?  Things were already bad so who cares if the chatbot made it worse?\n \nreply",
      "If you actually page through the complaint, you will see the chat rather systematically trying to convince the kid of things, roughly \"No phone time, that's awful. I'm not surprised when I read of kids killing parents after decades of abuse...\"I think people are confused by this situation. Our society has restrictions on what you can do to kids. Even if they nominally give consent, they can't actually give consent. Those protections basically don't apply to kids insulting each other on the playground but they apply strongly to adults wandering onto the playground and trying to get kids to do violent things. And I would hope they apply doubly to adult constructing machines that they should know will attempt to get kids to do violent things. And the machine was definitely trying to do that if you look at the complaint linked by the gp (and the people who are lying about here are kind of jaw-dropping).And I'm not a coddle the kids person. Kids should know all the violent stuff in the world. They should be able to discover it but mere discovery definitely not what's happening in the screenshots I've seen.\n \nreply",

They picked 5 worst samples they could think of in the worst order possible probably out of 1000+ messages.The root cause here is the parents. It's visible behind those screenshots. The child clearly didn't trust their parents and didn't feel they cared, listened or tried to understand the problems the teen was going through. This is clearly a parenting failure.There's far worse content out there than these mild messages that teenagers will be in contact with, starting with 4chan, to various competitive video games to all other sorts of weird things.This is a cop out for parenting failure, where parents are looking to play victims, since they can't take responsibility for their failures and AI seems like something that could make them feel better.At 17, it's humiliating to have phone taken away from you in such manner, then your parents going through your phone to find those text messages in the first place. Then making a lawsuit out of this portraying all the intimate details to the public. These parents seem to have 0 care for their child.\n \nreply",

      "There was no encouragement of murder. Paraphrased, the AI said that given controlling nature of some parents it's no surprise that there are news articles of \"children killing their parents\". This is not an encouragement. It is a validation of how the kid felt, but in no way does it encourage to actually kill their parents. It's basic literacy to understand that it's not that. It's an empathetic statement. The kid felt that parents were overly controlling, AI validated that, role playing as another edgy teenager. But not actually suggesting or encouraging it.\n \nreply",
      "This \"conclusion\" ignores reality. Chat bots like those the article mentioned aren't sentient. They're overhyped next-token-predictor incapable of real reasoning even if the correlation can be astonishing. Withholding information about supposedly sensitive topics like violence or sexuality from children curious enough to ask as a taboo is futile, lazy and ultimately far more harmful than the information.We need to stop coddling parents who want to avoid talking to their children about non-trivial topics. It doesn't matter that they would rather not talk about sex, drugs and yesterday's other school shooting.\n \nreply",
      "You can understand something about your child's meatspace friends and their media diet. Chat like this may as well be 4chan discussions. It's all dynamic compared to social media that is posted and linkable, it's interactive and responsive to your communicated thinking, and it seeps in via exactly the same communication technique that you use with people (some messaging interface). So it is capable of, and will definitely be used for, way more persistent and pernicious steering of behavior OF CHILDREN by actors.There is no barrier to the characters being 4chan-level dialogs.

And when the signal handler is run, the runtime starts a green thread to run it, which means user Haskell code does not need to worry about signal handler safe functions at all, since from the OS perspective the signal handler has returned. The user handler function simply runs as a new green thread independent of other threads.But I like the fact that you brought up this idea.

You can work all you want on GitHub but it likely will be a couple star project unless it trends on a site like this.With how many developers oversell what they've built, everyone is generally skeptical with any new project. People are even more skeptical if a project mentions \"AI\".Then you have VC-backed companies who have their ways to get their projects noticed. They'll get stars, articles and publicity but there is no direct correlation with project quality and funding. People use these projects, they're terrible and the cycle of disillusionment continues.Given all that, it takes a certain resolve, belief in what you're doing and commitment to keep pushing forward. There will be little carrots along the way to re-energize you. Perhaps that is good enough, perhaps it's not. It's not for the faint of heart.I fully agree that when an open-source maintainer doesn't want to do it anymore, it's like anything else in life. We have free will and the right to decide to move on to other endeavors. Just like one does with any other job.\n \nreply",

Yes, it can feel like a community of users has high or unending expectations. But also, projects often invite and encourage users to use their cool new thing, develop processes or workflows that depend on the project, make claims that their project does everything that existing commercial project X does but cheaper/faster/with greater data privacy, etc. Announcements are made that \"the much requested feature X is underway and is planned to be included in release y.z\".

      "Previous baggage handler turned software dev here. Looks like you are targeting the bag room right now which is the best spot to start to prove the concept. It was surprising to me how manual the entire loading & sorting process was when I worked for the airlines.I'm curious if there's any roadmap eventually to get this out to the ramp itself. Most of the back injuries seemed to happen in the bin itself because you have to often hunch/be on your knees in a bin tossing 50+ pound bags. I know airlines would probably be very hesitant to have any new equipment around their planes but just curious if there's any discussion around that.Other side note, I also used to work in Cargo and always thought there could be way more efficient ways of loading loose packages that are on every flight and this seems to be a great possibility for those as well.Awesome work & will keep tabs on it!\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for the feedback!John B was obviously aware from previous experience what a manual and injury prone process this was, but I've also been really surprised as I've dived deeper into airport operations myself.Bagroom is definitely what we're targeting first - being indoors (usually) is a huge plus, and lets us focus on the manipulation part of the problem without going fully mobile yet.That said, we're definitely targeting tarmac/ramp operations, particularly between a TUG/PowerStow and narrow-body bag carts. Inside the bin is much trickier but we agree it's the least ergonomic part of the job, you just can't move a massive industrial arm in and out of a plane very easily. We have it on our longer-term roadmap, though, and intend to leverage the baggage dynamics data we collect everywhere else to give us a head start on the packing and manipulation problems there, just with a different mechanism.Cargo packing is a huge area of interest for us! Particularly around optimizing weight distribution in loaded planes, or just optimizing packing efficiency in general.\n \nreply",
      "This is much like a palletizer. Here's a mixed-case cage palletizer, which fills up wire cages open on one side with various boxes.[1] For rectangular boxes, palletizing is a solved problem with many companies selling systems.Irregular items are a problem. In the baggage handling video, the last bag, the soft one with straps, is sticking out after being placed in the baggage container. That's the same problem which keeps Amazon from totally automating picking. They keep trying, but nothing works well enough yet.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN-6QaLd3VY\n \nreply",
      "Yep! We're obviously operating alongside a very well established world of palletization and other order fulfillment type robots.We think that due to irregularity that it's not an easy tech transfer from the existing logistics world into the aviation world.

      "How would a single armed robot handle oversized luggage or luggage with weird centre of mass? Or poorly packed luggage who's centre of mass is shifting?Say golf club hard shells case where the owner's left a bunch of golf balls in the bottom of one of the pockets. It's difficult to tell that one end's quite a lot heavier then the other until you actually try to pick it up.At least to me I don't see a good way of handling this edge case. You'd need either a second manipulator, a very fast feedback system, or a way for the weird luggage to be diverted for human intervention.\n \nreply",
      "Great questions and a few answers to various parts of your question that you've mostly identified yourself I think:- Golf clubs specifically (and most sporting equipment) actually goes down a different pipeline in most airports, since generally this stuff doesn't behave well on conveyor belts.- Data driven approaches can tell you a lot just from visual information, usually about deformability of objects, but also about expected centers of mass, etc- Part of the reason we're using single big robots is because you can use heavy duty end-effectors - grasp all the way around the object with a grasp that's predicted to be robust to these kinds of perturbances, and then use quick feedback to safely execute a plan to place itYou're absolutely correct though, that there's a long tail of things coming through and that some objects are very, very difficult. Our problem formulation then becomes identifying confidence in graspability, and deciding explicitly that we shouldn't attempt to grasp some object and should instead flag them for human handling.\n \nreply",
      "I'm surprised the end effector works on misshapen fabric bags. Makes me jealous that I can't test it.Are you considering dynamic trajectory constraints in the planner (e.g. for multiple robots loading simultaneously)? That was a thorny problem back when I worked on arms.\n \nreply",
      "There are a lot of constraints in our planning, including what actions we can do for a particular bag/gripper interaction. Multiple robots working in collision range of each other isn't on the roadmap right now, but it's always a possibility.Suction works really well but it's not enough, we're rolling out a new gripper soon that covers more cases mechanically (there's a very long tail in the distribution of what comes through airports).\n \nreply",
      "Just my 2 cents but I would try with a suction gripper on a swiffer-broom-like joint so you can pick vertically (TCP facing +Z) and place horizontally (TCP facing +X): https://img.uline.com/is/image/uline/H-1960\n \nreply",
      "This is very cool, thank you for sharing. I work in automation and SWE for a certain 4-letter organization that delivers your mail. Pick/place is something we've rolled out using articulated and delta robots with vacuum end effectors, and it's an interesting and challenging space to be in. As in your case, bags and other amorphous shapes are always the most difficult. It's always an uphill battle to hit throughput targets due to exception cases that can stop things until a human gets involved. Ultimately, it can be a struggle to avoid overpromising and to generate ROI since automation is so costly, especially when there's no opportunity to bound the problem by influencing the inputs to your system or the output requirements (in your case, the cart being loaded). Best of luck and looking forward to seeing your new end effector.\n \nreply"

      "My experience with Sqitch was \"all the fun of git rebase with all the fun of manual rollback and verification code\" :-( I would never wish that upon my enemiesI'm open to the fact that we may have just had legacy antipatterns drug into the project, since it was shoehorned into the team by a similarly strongly opinionated advocate\n \nreply",

      "We've looked into this tool a couple times, haven't adopted it yet. The main issue is compatibility with prisma, which we use for defining our db's schema and automating migrations. If there were a slick integration between the two, that would go a long way to convincing us to adopt. In the meantime, we'll go with convenience and (slightly, almost immeasurably) lower reliability. We haven't had downtime due to a migration in months!\n \nreply",
      "Yes, this is the biggest issue right now and we\u2019re working on a solution.What we want to do is add the ability to generate the pgroll migrations based on the prisma generated migration files. Depending on the operation, you might need to add more info.This will work fairly generally, not only prisma.\n \nreply",

      "This seems like a great tool! I like how it \"simply\" works by putting a view on top of the actual table. This concept is widely used in the data engineering world  (in dbt).There must be an easier way to write migrations for pgroll though. I mean, JSON, really?\n \nreply",
      "Unrelated to the OP product but I\u2019m curious how people are solving this issue on smaller scale with nextjs + prisma/drizzle. Do you just run the builtin migrate script with npm run?\n \nreply",

      "A good mental model is to compare the number of floats being processed -vs- the number of primitive computations. Matrix multiplication has n^3 computation with n^2 data. Multiplication of large matrices is therefore special in the potential for \"data re-use\" (each float is used against all the columns or rows of the other matrix) -- so systems are designed to have a much higher flops throughput than memory bandwidth. A dot product is at the other extreme, where each float is used only once (loosely).Roofline plots [1] are framework to visualize system design from this perspective.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roofline_model\n \nreply",
      "That property is the same reason you don't incur substantial overhead doing large matrix multiplications sharded over disks or many machines. You apply the same chunking strategies used to optimally use L1/L2/L3 caches, just instead at the level of numa nodes, physical disks, machines, and clusters. So long as each \"cache\" is big enough for the N^3/N^2 term to dominate communication overhead (especially if that communication can happen concurrently), the networked result is about as fast as the individual machines running at their max FLOPs for some smaller problem.\n \nreply",
      "This is amplified even more by the fact that only the trivial implementation of matmul is O(n^3) whereas efficient ones (e.g BLAS) use things like the Strassen algorithm. You can also speed it up significantly by using cache-aware approaches when retrieving rows and columns. In practice there is a huge amount of theory behind this that is far beyond the average person's scope if they are not actual researchers.\n \nreply",
      "Is there actually a BLAS implementation that uses strassen?I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate that only trivial implementations use the direct o(n^3) algorithm. AFAIK high performance BLAS implementations just use highly optimized versions of it.\n \nreply",
      "BLAS is just the library definition and not the implementation, so BLAS implementations could implement GEMM anyway they want. But in practice the triple loop method (n^3) is the most common, despite Strassen's and the more numerically stable, Winograd methods being well known and available for decades. But with most things involving real computing hardware, memory access patterns and locality tend to be more important for performance than operation counts\n \nreply",
      "I remember reading that it\u2019s too hard to get good memory bandwidth/l2 utilization in the fancy algorithms, you need to read contiguous blocks and be able to use them repeatedly. But I also haven\u2019t looked at the gpu blas implementations directly.\n \nreply",
      "AIUI, Strassen gets used moderately commonly with non-floating-point datatypes, where numerical stability is less of a concern and multiplications are more useful to minimize than memory traffic. But from what I can tell, every floating-point BLAS library eschews Strassen, despite a steady trickle of papers saying \"hey, there might be some small wins if we go to Strassen!\"\n \nreply",
      "The big issue with Strassen isn't performance - it's numerical stability.\n \nreply",
      "Not that long ago, I tried using the FFT to do matrix multiplication since it was supposed to be asymptomatically faster. It turns out that the constant factor is huge compared to the O(n^3) grade school algorithm that BLAS optimizes via tiling and other tricks. Even if it looks expensive on paper, the cubic algorithm is fast.I just wish I understood the tricks done to make it so fast so I could implement my own for variations for which there are no pre-existing BLAS implementations.

From what I have read, these rectifiers would usually consist of an aluminum and lead electrode in a jar of Twenty Mule Team Borax solution.  Borax is another name for sodium tetraborate.  The aluminum becomes the cathode after a forming process of applying some ac current through the rectifier.  Often, many jars were used in order to accomodate high voltages.
