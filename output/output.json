As someone who's around my 30s now with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and who has friends with the condition, I've always found it a bit too bleak about the quality of our lives (probably for drama's sake). Yes, I need a wheelchair and full time care attendants, but also:* I went to university and had a great time there* I had a pretty normal social life growing up, and made some life-long real life friends in college who I still visit regularly.* I talk to women and have had romantic relationships.* I've had and continue to have what I consider a pretty successful career in software.* While I like video games and played a lot of them in high school, I'd say I prefer going out and having interactions with friends more, however challenging it can be logistically.I know DMD severity varies between patients, but I don't want this article to discourage people with DMD or with children that have DMD.

      "So, on top of the GHG generated by the livestock themselves, which are large, as well as the GHG to generate fertilizer and grow the feedstock for livestock, the food we store for them also significantly generates GHG emissions?It seems more and more like we might want to collectively reduce the amount of meat we're eating. I'm no vegan, but like, maybe eating meat only sometimes is a good idea. (Also, probably leads to less CAFOs and other questionably ethical practices if we, say, halve the amount of livestock we need.)\n \nreply",
      "The fact that you have to preface with \"I'm no vegan\" really sums up the entire issue of centuries-long commercial propaganda on behalf of the meat and dairy industry. Americans eat way, way too much meat and anyone who tells them to cut back is a dirty vegan. These companies don't just sell meat, but an ideology and lifestyle to boot.As an example, I was in Florida a few months ago and my girlfriend and I casually mention that we were making a salad for dinner after someone asked about our dinner plans. Their immediate response was defensive, saying, \"Are you one of them vegans? Well, we only eat meat around these parts\" and proceeded to tell us all about these great deals on meat at a local store, thinking that we'd hear those prices and be unable to resist and start eating meat.Just because we mentioned a salad, his manufactured, mass-produced opinion was that we must be vegan. We're not. She's vegetarian, I'm pescatarion, but the difference is immaterial to a meat addict who's been sold a crusade.It's the same story with our country's cult-like addiction to alcohol. Every time I go out and don't drink, I have to explain to people that I'm not a teetotaler, and have to explain the foreign concept of moderation. They get defensive and try to get me to drink anyway, because if I don't, they're forced to reckon with their own lifestyle choices of excess. Exact same issue with our meat consumption.\n \nreply",
      ">  Americans eat way, way too much meat and anyone who tells them to cut back is a dirty veganIts not like \"greed for meat\", its also cultural preference (meat was a \"whenever you can, if you can afford it\" food for centuries), and also the cheapness and readiness of meat as a ready-to-eat food relative to vegetables. Burgers and hot dogs require a lot fewer steps to cook them than almost anything with vegetables, and they're usually about as expensive.Whens the last time you saw a vegetable other than lettuce at a fast food place? There's not a lot of ready veggies, and they don't keep very well.Meat honestly sucks as a thing for the world though - way more land, have to grow massive amounts of grain. I reduced most of my meat consumption to eat better, but it does require more effort, or more money for restaurants and takeout for convenience.\n \nreply",

This volatility is a representation of the risk-neutral probability distribution that the markets puts on the underlying returns. From that distribution we can price other financial products for which prices are not directly observable.\n \nreply",
      "Sure, but isn't most of supply and demand in the market driven by large investors who use such formulas to derive the fair price of the option?That is, if the real price ever differred significantly from what Black-Scholes predicts, wouldn't algorithmic trading very quickly correct this deviation?\n \nreply",

Probability of log-prices follows a diffusion with an initial Dirac delta at-the-money. At expiration the profit function is deterministic (0 out of the money, a ramp if in the money) and the probability is certain gaussian. The expectancy of the value of a function applied to a random var of given density is like a weighted sum of the values, weighted by the frequency/density, as in a dot product (an integral here). Add to that the \"time value of money\" (see Investopedia) that works as linear drift, and you are done.\n \nreply",

There\u2019s lots of\ngood stuff in it, but today I am writing about getentropy()\nwhich is the first officially standardized POSIX API for getting\ncryptographically secure random numbers.On Linux the getentropy(3) function is based on the\ngetrandom(2) system call. In Linux 6.11 there is\na new vDSO call, vgetrandom(), that makes it possible\nto implement getentropy() entirely in userland, which should\nmake it significantly faster.UUID v4 and v7 are great examples of the need for high\nperformance secure random numbers: you don\u2019t want the performance of\nyour database inserts to be limited by your random number generator!\nAnother example is DNS source port and query ID randomization which\nhelp protect DNS resolvers against forged answers.I was inspired to play with getentropy() by a blog post about getting\na few secure random bytes in PostgreSQL without pgcrypto:\nit struck me that PostgreSQL doesn\u2019"

I don't think that's a particularly great place to live in - seems to be a museum now anyhow - but it's a wonderful idea. In a lot of ways architecture is about setting high expectations, and that does it. A lot of his other work - the Usonian designs - look to me to be like what became 80's style American architecture. But I'm no student of the field; I just admired Fallingwater.\n \nreply",
      "This is a pattern with the early modern architects, especially as the materials and construction process were still mildly experimental.LeCorbusier also made a house (Villa Savoye) that was supposed to be functional and easy to live in. It looks super clear and luminous and could be mistaken for a modern house at a glance, but was a hell to maintain (leaked like a seave) and not great to live in in general.\n \nreply",
      "I don't get the worship, either.  Fallingwater has required a lot of intervention to stay up.  The much praised Johnson Wax complex has a tower that can't be occupied.  The administration building has workers on the ground floor (\"Great Workroom\") where management can look down upon them from the second floor.  He dictated how people who commissioned him were to live in their homes down to what they could and could not have in them.  Many of those houses have required work as well.

      "> his designs are \u2026 often downright hostile to having any natural light indoorsAre you sure about this? From Wikipedia [0]:> To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors.Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds.Also check out the interior of the Johnson wax headquarters, the ceiling is basically a giant sky light [1][0]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright[1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright#/media/Fi...\n \nreply",

      "How are kernel or application updates applied to buildroot-installed systems?\n \nreply",
      "I've previously developed a commercial product that used buildroot.In that case, it used an A/B partition layout like Android, along with a custom update script and kernel-based bootloader to implement atomic updates and fallback capability. The rootfs image was built by buildroot and devices would query an API and download the image, then write it to the inactive root partition.You can do effectively the same thing with GRUB, but the project I worked on also supported devices that booted using u-boot. The kexec bootloader allowed a single implementation for different architectures and platforms.So, the answer is you can update however you want, but there are a few common ways it's done in embedded.\n \nreply",
      "I would love to know. I currently have an embedded product using buildroot and as it is not exposed to a network at all, I don't have any worries about security. However, I'd love to hear of a nice mechanism to basically upgrade the system image in place. I imagine you could use something like a pair of partitions and just change the kernel boot parameters to point at the most recent one, but I'm curious about what solutions people use.\n \nreply",
      "Well, buildroot is mainly for embedded applications, so whatever applies to that: OTA updates with A/B partitioning are common. OStree-based are getting a lot of traction as well.But technically you could build something with a package manager etc and update as usual. It's just a build system.\n \nreply",
      "It's sort of out of the scope of Buildroot, but there are different systems like mender or swupdate that cover updates. They tend to need some level of platform specific changes because embedded systems these days have 7 levels of bootloaders.\n \nreply"

      "Recently became totally enamored with Wittgenstein - one of those thinkers who's core ideas have lived, inarticulate, in my heart, since I was a child: Language has no definite meaning, we operate in a fog of connotation, real communication of meaning is impossible, there is no possible scientific description of every-day concepts like \"chair\"... So much to be gained from overcoming \"the bewitchment of language\". Brilliant thinker.Had no idea the duck-rabbit was attributed to him! Appears attributed incorrectly, but one can see why: The drawing is neither a duck nor a rabbit, while also being both a duck _and_ a rabbit. Ask a toddler if it's a duck and they'll say of course! Ask a philosopher, and they wont be sure! Language is fun (and meaningless!)If you\u2019re in the mood for a nice philosophy lecture, here\u2019s a great overview on Wittgenstein: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Rb56kZQSk\n \nreply",

When you enter the passcode in front of the duck, it transforms into a rabbit and warps away through a portal that appears for a brief moment while a spooky sound effect plays.\n \nreply",
