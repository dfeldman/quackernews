      "In the OP screen share, they toggle various telemetry options on and off, but every time a setting changes, there is a pop-up that says \"a setting has changed that requires a restart [of the editor] to take effect\" -- and the user just hits \"cancel\" and doesn't restart the editor. Then, unsurprisingly, the observed behavior doesn't change.

      "Love the idea & spitballing ways to generalize to coding..Thought experiment: as you write code, an LLM generates tests for it & the IDE runs those tests as you type, showing which ones are passing & failing, updating in real time. Imagine 10-100 tests that take <1ms to run, being rerun with every keystroke, and the result being shown in a non-intrusive way.The tests could appear in a separated panel next to your code, and pass/fail status in the gutter of that panel. As simple as red and green dots for tests that passed or failed in the last run.The presence or absence and content of certain tests, plus their pass/fail state, tells you what the code you\u2019re writing does from an outside perspective. Not seeing the LLM write a test you think you\u2019ll need? Either your test generator prompt is wrong, or the code you\u2019re writing doesn\u2019t do the things you think they do!Making it realtime helps you shape the code.Or if you want to do traditional TDD, the tooling could be reversed so you write the tests and the LLM makes them pass as soon as you stop typing by writing the code.reply",

Currently I use their default version, but there is a local hosted option I'll be switching too now the proof of concept works.So using Home Assistant I have a simple script that detects when a washing machine cycle is complete AND the door has NOT been opened.

      "What's really wild is $2M is around the cost of a single Tomahawk cruise missile, Patriot missiles can cost almost double that. The Excalibur GPS guided round costs roughly as much as a nice Mercedes and during a conflict hundreds or thousands can be fired.I came to this realization when learning about someone driving a car into a building to do damage and thinking \"wow, that's an expensive round\", then looking it up and realizing, it's not actually that expensive compared to how much military projectiles really do cost.I've found it somewhat interesting that we'll be shocked at a fire truck, which gets a life time of 15-25 years and works in the service exclusively of saving lives, costs around $2 million, but not be shocked that we effectively use something as expensive as a fire truck as a single round in a gigantic gun.Not to say that fire trucks don't potentially cost too much, nor that military weapons aren't worth it.

      "> If I was routinely working in a language that had a well respected de facto standard parser generator and lexer, and regularly building parsers for little languages for my programs, it would probably be worth mastering these tools.In OCaml, a language highly suited for developing languages in, that de facto standard is the Menhir LR parser generator. It's a modern Yacc with many convenient features, including combinator-like library functions. I honestly enjoy the work of mastering Menhir, poring over the manual, which is all one page: https://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/manual.htmlreply",
      "I wonder who it is that likes other kinds of parser. Over the last ~10 years or so I've read several articles arguing that recursive descent parsers are in fact great on HN. And they seem to be both the easiest to get started with and what almost all production-grade systems use. I've seen very little in the way of anything arguing for any other approaches.reply",
      "Recursive descent is fine if you trust that you won't write buggy code. If you implement a generator for it (easy enough), this may be a justifiable thing to trust (though this is not a given). I am assuming you're willing to put up with the insanity of grammar rewriting, one way or another.LR however is more powerful, though this mostly matters if you don't have access to automatic grammar rewriting for your LL. More significantly, however, there's probably more good tooling for LR (or perhaps: you can assume that if tooling exists, it is good at what it is designed for); one problem with LL being so \"simple\" is that there's a lot of bad tooling out there.The important things are 1. that you meaningfully eliminate ambiguities (which is easy to enforce for LR and doable for LL if your tooling is good), and 2. that you keep linear time complexity. Any parser other than LL/LR should be rejected because it fails at least one of these, and often both.Within the LL and LR families there are actually quite a few members. SLR(1) is strong enough to be interesting but too weak for anything I would call a \"language\". LALR(1) is probably fine; I have never encountered a useful language that must resort to LR(1) (though note that modern tooling can do an optimistic fallback, avoiding the massive blowups of ancient LR tools). SLL(1) I'm not personally familiar with. X(k), where X is one of {SLL, LL, SLR, LALR, LR} and where k > 1, are not very useful; k=1 suffices. LL(*) however should be avoided due to backtracking, but in some cases consider if you can parsing token trees first (this is currently poorly represented in the literature; you want to be doing some form of this for error recovery anyway - automated error recovery is a useless lie) and/or defer the partial ambiguity until the AST is built (often better for error messages anyway, independent of using token trees).reply",
      "But remember that the articles arguing for recursive descent parsers are arguing against the long-dominant paradigm of using LR parsers. Plenty of us still like LR parser generators (see my other comment.)In between \"easiest to get started with\" and \"what production-grade systems use\", there is \"easy to actually finish a medium-sized project with.\" I think LR parsers still defend that middle ground pretty well.reply",
      "> But in practice I bounce back and forth between two languages right now (Go and Python, neither of which have such a standard parser ecology)https://pypi.org/project/pybison/ , or its predecessors such as https://pypi.org/project/ply/ ?But yes, the decidedly non-traditional https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing/ is certainly more popular.reply",
      "I have never found parser generators to be worth the hassle. Recursive descent with a little Pratt-style precedence climbing is all you need.reply",
      "Related: Resilient LL Parsing Tutorial https://matklad.github.io/2023/05/21/resilient-ll-parsing-tu...reply",
      "In terms of language-agnosticism, you can use Bison to calculate the tables (the hard part) and dump an xml file, then implement the machine yourself trivially.I get really annoyed when people still complain about YACC while ignoring the four decades of practical improvement that Bison has given us if you bother to configure it.reply",
      "A middle ground that I think is sometimes useful is to use an LR parser generator to check if the grammar is ambiguous, but use recursive descent for the actual implementation. Since we won't actually use any code from the LR parser generator, you can pick whatever one you prefer regardless of the programming language.reply",
      "I recently wrote a small C compiler that uses a recursive decent parser while this should not be possible if you just look at the syntax grammar. Why, because it looks at some semantic information about the class of identifiers, whether they are variables of typedefs for example. On the otherhand this is not very surprising, because in the days C was developed, easy parsing was a practical implication of it not being an academic research thing, but something that just had to work.Recursive decent parsers can simply be implemented with recusive functions. Implementing semantic checks becomes easy with additional parameters.reply"

      "It's amazing the impact that the reintroduction has had. On a recent winter trip there I also learned that the reintroduction literally moved rivers [1]:- Elk quit loitering along streams, so willow and cottonwood shot up, anchoring soil and narrowing channels.- The new woody growth gave beavers lumber; their colonies jumped from one in 1996 to a dozen within fifteen years, raising water tables and rebuilding wetlands.- With healthier riparian zones came deeper pools, colder water, and a surge in native trout and song-bird nests.[1] https://phys.org/news/2025-02-predators-ecosystems-yellowsto...reply",
      "I\u2019ve always found the idea of \u201crestoring\u201d ecosystems a bit philosophically tricky. When we say that reintroducing wolves led to ecological improvements, what\u2019s our reference point? Are we comparing it to Yellowstone 100 years ago? 500? Pre-human settlement?Ecological baselines are inherently arbitrary\u2014there\u2019s no objectively \u201ccorrect\u201d state of nature to return to. The systems we call degraded are often just different, not necessarily worse. So when we talk about progress in this context, we\u2019re really measuring against a value-laden idea of what we think nature should look like, not some neutral truth.That doesn\u2019t mean rewilding is bad\u2014but I do think we should acknowledge that we\u2019re shaping nature to fit human values, not restoring it to some pure, original state.reply",
      "Instead of thinking of this as a benefit of wolves (specifically), you can view it as an advantage of having something in their ecological niche. In this case, the niche is 'apex predator.' It's a niche which is repeated across pretty much every ecosystem. They keep populations of their prey species down, preventing overpopulation and the many indirect problems that come with it.Perhaps without an apex predator the prey species would evolve out of the overpopulation problem eventually. However, species that evolve with a predator tend to reproduce more quickly, which helps avoid being completely wiped out by the predator - when the population constraint impose by the predator is removed, the prey population explodes, leading to particularly pronounced problems.(Perhaps if we had to contend with some homo-vampirus, we wouldn't have global climate change...)Overall, humans already interfered in the shape of the ecosystem by removing wolves. You're correct that there's no objective 'correct' state for an ecosystem. But it is worthwhile to help balance ecosystems, especially when they have been unbalanced by our own interventions. Without restoration work, we're headed to a world with humans, livestock, and the few species that manage to live on our margins.reply",
      ">  we're headed to a world with humans, livestock, and the few species...It looks more and more like we're headed toward a world where we'll regenerate extinct species in labs; and grow our steaks in meat factories. If we no longer need cattle farms, it's possible we'll vote to preserve more lands.reply",
      "I\u2019m usually the last person to take this side of a discussion but I don\u2019t see how feasible since:  - the existence species regeneration does not imply the incentivize to regenerate and manage the vast majority of extinct species  \n  - lack of gene samples for vast majority of species  \n  - we don\u2019t and are not very close to having a viable model for environment and species fitness so we can\u2019t accurately model what specifies to regenerate  \n  - new species populations have to be managed before and after initial release \n  - land and labor capital investmentreply",
      "I hope so. In the meantime, we should try to preserve as much natural genetic information as possible, even assuming we can vet the species back.reply",
      "Is there any evidence this has any traction, is actually feasible (the reintroduction part), and is not merely a publicity stunt for some biotech startups?I think a more realistic point of view is that once a species is gone, it's truly gone, and that we should worry about keeping alive those still existing, because there's no \"undo\" button.reply",
      "> species that evolve with a predator tend to reproduce more quicklyAs an example of this, a healthy female rabbit will produce anywhere from 20 to 50 additional rabbits in a single year.  There have been many documented explosions of rabbit populations due to lack of natural predators which have caused significant ecological crisis.They've evolved to reproduce so quickly because they are the \"food\" in the food chain.  Without the predators above them, they will _eventually_ stop reproducing so quickly because they are only killing themselves by doing so.reply",
      "It's worth puzzling about the mechanisms that would lead a fast reproducing species to slow down...My best guess is that internal competition for scarce resources leads to territoriality, which in turn might select for better resource utilization. Including reduced reproduction, which creates more resource competition. But this doesn't feel super obvious.Otherwise, we have plague and starvation acting as stand ins for apex predators, which isn't much fun... And apparently isn't generally enough to reduce environmental externalities from over population.reply",

I\u2019ve been using kagi as a search engine on and off for a while now.It\u2019s a safari-based browser so it\u2019s really heavily optimized for power draw. It has almost all features I need and supports chrome and firefox extensions, which is wild. You can create spaces just like in Arc, which is a must have. You have all the bells and whistles you need. The only thing I\u2019m missing is multi-account containers, or a way to isolate google or meta products for example into its own profile. But I can live with that for now. The browser is in active development and "

      "Comments about SLS miss what\u2019s happening. SLS is inefficient and wasteful, but human spaceflight is not what\u2019s getting cut at NASA.  Instead, very productive current and future science missions are getting killed, in defiance of Congress [1].Until this year, NASA was the world leader in space science.  We\u2019re pushing out the experts who build and operate astrophysics missions like Hubble, Chandra, JWST, Kepler, TESS, Swift, and many more in planetary and heliophysics. This is a loss of capacity that will set the US back a generation.The private sector is irrelevant here: SpaceX and friends don\u2019t do scientific research.[1] https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/trump-administration-m...reply",
      "> the world leader in space science.\n\nI also want to add that science is a critical investment area for anyone interested in engineering.There is this common belief of \"I just want to make things work\" and that science is really unimportant here and are concerned with things that don't matter. The truth is that science builds the foundation for that other stuff. It is the very ground you stand on. Engineering without science is like trying to run without ground.In a lot of ways, science is just like engineering (I say this having been both, professionally). Any good engineer knows it is important to find problems. Then you fix those problems. Well... that's really what science does too. When doing science you're just working at the next level of abstraction. It is all about \"making things work.\" Everyone is on the same team here and I'm not sure why we draw these divisions. I mean what would science even be about if it wasn't \"making things work?\"So I hear people say that engineering is where we get the real value (especially monetarily), but I'd disagree. It matters, but I think it is framing things weirdly. I'd be willing to wager that the economic impact of Newton and Leibniz's invention of Calculus[0] is larger than the economic impact of any engineering product, ever. I'd make a slightly less confident wager that the economic value of calculus is more valuable than all inventions post 1700. That's just one thing too... even if it was the only Science/Math \"investment\" then it seems like a pretty good ROI[0] Yes, math, but I'm throwing under science. Nitpick if you want but you're missing the thesisreply",
      "These cuts are absolutely not the ones I would make, but the reality is not as it is being portrayed.The claim that SpaceX does not do science is false.  Not only do they launch most of NASA's science missions, which counts, they also do independent science, including the Polaris Dawn and FRAM 2.  Along with Axiom, they put science missions on the ISS, and all the NASA science done on ISS is facilitated by SpaceX putting humans there.  Finally, literally everything that SpaceX has done or built is a result of science that SpaceX has had to do, including colder than ever propellants, and life support systems, etc.  The Polaris Dawn spacewalk was not a replication of the 1960s spacewalks, as it was based on new suit science, etc.Somehow, people like to pretend that probes landing on other planets is the only form of science that is done.And the reality is that new entrants from RKLB, SpaceX, Firefly, and a lot of smaller companies are doing exactly this kind of science as well--- but at vastly lower cost.The inescapable reality-- and this will always be the case with political organizations like NASA-- is no matter how well meaning they cannot do science as effectively as private organizations.  NASA slows science down in large part because they are hamstrung by congress.Yes, it looks like some way too expensive projects are getting cancelled and that means some waste of money.  It's not the choice I would make.But in the next 10 years, nearly %100 of all science will be done outside of NASA.... because the NASA overhead is too much, makes things too expensive, and less reliable.For example, it's better to blow up 1 falcon one, and 2 falcon 9s, to get 500 successful falcon 9 launches at 1/100th the cost per kilogram of mass to orbit than to have a completely successful SLS system that launches only 2-3 times a decade.The former accelerates science, lowers the cost of all science and more science gets done per dollar than the latter.That transition is happening whether government, the senate and congress is aboard.... or not.reply",

      "The cuts to NASA as well as NOAA, NIH, USGS, USDA, FWS, DOE, etc. are not really saving that much money, but are destroying literally trillions of dollars of future economic value (not to mention all sorts of work whose value can't be easily quantified).Maybe \"smashing things and ruining people's lives and work is fun per se\" is a better explanation than anything more complicated. Pretty shitty for the rest of us though.reply",
      "> The cuts to [...] are not really saving that much money, but are destroying literally trillions of dollars of future economic value\n\nI think everyone (or at least the parent) understands that. I mean there's a part that's deeply connected to what I said in another comment[0]The real issue is essentially: which would you rather have, $1 now or $10 tomorrow?[1]People see it as savings because they have that money now. That's the way JumpCrisscross used it (and I very much don't think they agree that this is how the gov should be working). But the way you're using it is \"I'd rather have the $10 tomorrow\".I'm pointing this out because now people are talking past one another. I'm pointing this out because it is a really common pattern (\"now\" vs \"later\") that is used and frequently causes miscommunication due to different assumptions about what we want (e.g. \"maximize money now\" or \"maximize money during x period of time\"). Though it doesn't always have to do with money.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44705004[1] Be careful to not trivialize this. The numbers are abstract as well as the points in time. Also consider that $1 now might be far more valuable than $10 tomorrow. For example, if you get $1 now you might be able to afford a bus ticket to a location where you can get $1m, but only if you get there today. That's worth a lot more than $10 tomorrow. So we have to be mindful of what conditions actually exist if we want to actually communicate. Unfortunately, these are usually assumed and not communicated... The people that want to just take the money are well aware of this tendency...reply",
      "This apologia for the cuts would be more persuasive if they didn\u2019t come in concert with record-breaking increases to the pentagon budget and historic deficits.  There\u2019s no calculation happening here with present or future value, they\u2019re lavishly funding things they like and decimating things they don\u2019t. You don\u2019t place a reality TV \u2018star\u2019 as the director of any agency you care about.reply",
      "I'm pretty sure that neither money saved today or tomorrow are factors in these cuts. This administration is out to grief science and scientists--it doesn't matter if it saves money or costs money. The whole point is hostility to science. It's not an economic decision.reply",

In particular, I wanted to write about how a formal specification is different from a traditional program. It took a while for this idea to really click in my own head, and I wanted to motivate some intuition here.In particular, there have been a number of formal specification tools that have been developed in recent years which use programming-language-like notation, such as FizzBee, P, PlusCal, and Quint. I think these notations are more approachable for programmers than the more set-theoretic notation of TLA+. But I think the existence of programming-language-like formal specification languages makes it even more important to drive home the difference between a program and a formal spec.
