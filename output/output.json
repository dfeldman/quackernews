      "Tahoe is a macOS mis-step on par with  Windows 8 or Windows Vista. If you\u2019re from Apple and reading this, my feedback is pretty succinct: \u201cI don\u2019t recommend others upgrade. I wish I didn\u2019t.\u201dLuckily for Apple, Windows 11 is not exactly in a position to attract switchers.Let\u2019s see if Apple can turn things around. iOS 8+ did improve on iOS 7\u2019s worst bits.reply",
      "One of the most annoying things after installing Tahoe for me, that for no good reason an ordinary app would randomly lose its focus. In the midst of my typing. This is unbelievably preposterous and I just can't stop hating Apple for this crap. How the fuck this is acceptable? I just have no words. What makes it even worse that I couldn't even complain about it on their support pages - they just keep removing my comments for being \"non-constructive\". This is some random bug, and many people have complained about it, how am I suppose to make it \"more constructive\"? Send them the exact configuration of constellations, the number of monitors I use and their positioning angles, log the keyboard rate and delay, the latency, the level of magnetic interference caused by my Bluetooth devices, etc.?reply",
      "I wonder whether this could be a touchpad malfunction, causing phantom clicks that move focus. To diagnose, you could temporarily disable it and use an external mouse.reply",
      "External mice also suck with macOS though.reply",
      "I have a Logitech MX Vertical and it works flawlessly.reply",
      "Not sure why this is getting downvotes, it's absolutely true.  For a very long time you couldn't even set different scroll directions for external mice and the touchpad - even if it's (maybe? I forget) supported now it's always been an area Apple didn't care about and was far behind Windows and Linux.reply",
      "I assume it\u2019s getting down votes because it\u2019s off-topic. The parent comment was suggesting external mice as a temporary measure to debug the intermittent issue they\u2019re facing.Whether or not external micr suck on MacOS doesn\u2019t really matter. The objective was to diagnose an issue.",
      "It's not supported as of now. Tools like Scroll Reverser are still needed to specify scrolling behavior between the touchpad and an external mouse.",
      "I appreciate your frustration, but at the same time what is Apple supposed to do? If it's affecting only a tiny number of users, and you just happen to be an unlucky one, and they don't know how to reproduce it, and you can't help them reproduce it, then what? I think they just have to wait until somebody (such as yourself) is able to figure out with some kind of logging what is happening. E.g. the first question to answer is probably what actually gets the focus, if anything? To produce a bug report that at least suggests which area of code might be responsible.I had a similar problem at one point, then finally figured out it was when I accidentally hit the fn button which triggered the emoji picker window and moved focus to it (IIRC), but it was off-screen because I'd previously used it on a secondary monitor. Reconnecting the monitor and moving the window back to my primary display fixed it. (Obviously, it's a bug to show a picker window outside of visible coordinates, and I think it got fixed eventually.)But it also might not be Apple at all, if it's some third-party background utility with a bug. E.g. if that were happening to me, my first thought would be that it might be a Logitech bug or a Karabiner-Elements bug. Uninstalling any non-Apple background processes or utilities seems like a necessary first step.reply",

      "I went down the self host route some years ago but once critical problems hit I realized that beyond a simple NAS it can be a very demanding hobby.I was in another country when there was a power outage at home. My internet went down, the server restart but couldn't reconnect anymore because the optical network router also had some problems after the power outage. I could ask my folks to restart, and turn on off things but nothing more than that. So I couldn't reach my Nextcloud instance and other stuff. Maybe an uninterruptible power supply could have helped but the more I was thinking about it after just didn't really worth the hassle anymore. Add a UPS okay. But why not add a dual WAN failover router for extra security if the internet goes down again? etc. It's a bottomless pit (like most hobbies tbh)Also (and that's a me problem maybe) I was using Tailscale but I'm more \"paranoid\" about it nowadays. Single point of failure service, US-only SSO login (MS, Github, Apple, Google), what if my Apple account gets locked if I redeem a gift card and I can't use Tailscale anymore? I still believe in self hosting but probably I want something even more \"self\" to the extremes.reply",
      "My spouse and I work at home and after the first couple multi-day power outages we invested in good UPSs and a whole house standby generator. Now when the power goes out it's down for at most 30 seconds.This also makes self-hosting more viable, since our availability is constrained by internet provider rather than power.reply",
      "Yea I think my own preference for self-hosting boils down to a distrust of a continuous dependency on a service in control of a company and a desire to minimize such dependencies. While there are FOSS and self-hostable alternatives to tailscale or indeed claude code, using those services themselves simply replaces old dependencies on externally-controlled cloud-based services on new onesreply",

      "VPS's are really so dirt cheap that some of them only work because people dont use the servers 100% that they are allocated at or when people dont use the resources they have for most part because of economies of scale but vps's are definitely subsidized.Cheap vps servers 1 gb ram and everything can cost around 10-11$ per year and using something like hetzner's cheap as well for around 30$ ish an year or 3$ per month most likely while having some great resilient numbers and everythingIf anything, people self host because they own servers so upgrading becomes easier (but there are vps's which target a niche which people should look at like storage vps, high perf vps, high mem vps etc. which can sometimes provide servers for dirt cheap for your specific use case)The other reason I feel like are the ownership aspect of things. I own this server, I can upgrade this server without costing a bank or like I can stack up my investment in a way and one other reason is that with your complete ownership, you don't have to enforce t&c's so much. Want to provide your friends or family vps servers or people on internet themselves? Set up a proxmox or incus server and do it.Most vps servers sometimes either outright ban reselling or if they allow, they might sometimes ban your whole account for something that someone else might have done so somethings are at jeopardy if you do this simply because they have to find automated ways of dealing with abuse at scale and some cloud providers are more lenient than others in banning matters.

      "HN disclosure: I\u2019m the author of Photos Backup Anywhere, but this thread mirrors the exact issues that pushed me to write it.One thing that surprised me when digging into Apple Photos is how much state isn\u2019t represented by just files-on-disk. Albums, Live Photos (paired assets), bursts, slo-mo, edits, and even \u201csimple\u201d things like adjusted capture dates are all tracked separately, and most export/backup tools end up flattening or partially reconstructing that on restore.The approach I took was to treat Photos as the source of truth and verify restored items against it, rather than assuming filesystem metadata is enough. As far as I know, this is the only tool that restores albums and correctly round-trips all Photos item types while preserving location data, creation dates, and modification dates when restoring back into Photos.Project page is here if it\u2019s useful:\nhttps://photosbackup.app/Happy to explain details if anyone\u2019s curious \u2014 there are a lot of sharp edges in Photos once you go beyond \u201cexport originals\u201d.reply",

Photos Backup Anywhere restore works by re-importing items while explicitly reapplying Photos-level attributes: paired assets for Live Photos, burst membership and picks, slo-mo metadata, edits, locations, adjusted capture dates, and then reconstructing albums after the items exist again in the library.In other words, the filesystem copy isn\u2019t treated as the source of truth. The restore verifies items against what was backed up and only then rebuilds higher-level structure like albums.

      "IMO, for real file systems, just give a view via cgroups/namespaces.Implementing a database abstraction as a file system for an LLM feels like an extra layer of indirection for indirection's sake: just have the LLM write some views/queries/stored procs and give it sane access permissions.LLMs are smart enough to use databases, email, etc without needing a FUSE layer to do so, and permissions/views/etc will keep it from doing or seeing stuff it shouldn't. You'll be keeping access and permissions where they belong, and not in a FUSE layer, and you won't have to maintain a weird abstraction that's annoying/hampered with licensing issues if you want to deploy it cross platform.Also, your simplified FUSE abstraction will not map accurately to the state of the world unless you're really comprehensive with your implementation, and at that point, you might as well be interacting directly in order to handle that state accurately.reply",
      "Agree that to far fetched mappings to files don\u2019t really make sense. The email example is more illustrative then real world inspired, thought it might be good to show how flexible the approach is.I think there is a gap between \u201creal file systems\u201d and \u201cnon file things in a database\u201d where mapping your application representation of things to a filesystem is useful. Basically all those platforms that let users upload files for different purposes and work with them (ex Google Drive, notion, etc). In those cases representing files to an agent via a filesystem is the more intuitive and powerful interface compared to some home grown tools that the model never saw during training.reply",
      "LLMs can handle Google drive perfectly well with a service account, including the Google drive specific quirks through the API. It could be helpful to expose via a file system rather than a custom API if you wanted a different interface than Google already provides, but this wouldn\u2019t be driven by the limitations of the LLM.reply",

This could probably be mapped to a file system in a way that wouldn\u2019t trip up an agent, but at the expense of losing the Google drive specific functionality. A trade off, not much better or worse per se, but with the added complexity of the FUSE layer.reply",

You can optimise this and caching works after first fetch but the method is slow. The alternative is to leverage the existing API which will be million times faster. Now you could also create some kind of special file via fuse that acts like a search but it is weird and I don't think the models will do well with something so obscure.We went as much as implementing this idea in rust to really test it out and ultimately it was ditched because, well it sucks.reply",
      "I've been getting into FUSE a bit lately, as I stole an idea that a friend had of how to add CoW features to an existing non-CoW filesystem, so I've been on/off been hacking on a FUSE driver for ext4 to do that.To learn FUSE, however, I started just making everything into filesystems that I could mount. I wrote a FUSE driver for Cassandra, I wrote a FUSE driver for CouchDB, I wrote a FUSE driver for a thing that just wrote JSON files with Base64 encoding.None of these performed very well and I'm sort of embarrassed at how terrible the code is hence why I haven't published them (and they were also just learning projects), but I did find FUSE to be extremely fun and easy to write against.

There are connector for literally every possible storage (SFTP, S3, GDrive, Dropbox, FTP, Sharepoint, GCP, Azure Cloud, IPFS....), but also things like MySQL and Postgres (where the first level folder represent the list of databases, the second level is tables that belong to a database, and each row is represented as a form file generated from the schema), LDAP (where tree nodes are represented as folders and leaf are form files), ....The whole filesystem is available to agents via MCP [3] and has been published to the OpenAI marketplace since around Christmas, currently pending review.ref:[1]: https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash[2]: https://www.filestash.app/docs/guide/virtual-filesystem.html[3]: https://www.filestash.app/docs/guide/mcp-gateway.html\nhttps://github.com/mickael-kerjean/filestash/tree/master/ser...reply"

      "The idea that an \"observability stack\" is going to replace shell access on a server does not resonate with me at all. The metrics I monitor with prometheus and grafana are useful, vital even, but they are always fighting the last war. What I need are tools for when the unknown happens.The tool that manages all my tools is the shell. It is where I attach a debugger, it is where I install iotop and use it for the first time. It is where I cat out mysterious /proc and /sys values to discover exotic things about cgroups I only learned about 5 minutes prior in obscure system documentation. Take it away and you are left with a server that is resilient against things you have seen before but lacks the tools to deal with the future.reply",

It is where I cat out mysterious /proc and /sys values to discover exotic things about cgroups I only learned about 5 minutes prior in obscure system documentation.It is, SSH is indeed the tool for that, but that's because until recently we did not have better tools and interfaces.Once you try newer tools, you don't want to go back.Here's the example of my fairly recent debug session:    - Network is really slow on the home server, no idea why\n    - Try to just reboot it, no changes\n    - Run kernel perf, check the flame graph\n    - Kernel spends A LOT of time in nf_* (netfilter functions, iptables)\n    - Check iptables rules\n    - sshguard has banned 13000 IP addresses in its table\n    - Each network packet travels through all the rules\n    - Fix: clean the rules/skip the table for established connections/add timeouts\n\nYou don't need debugging facilities for many issues. You need observability and tracing.Instead of debugging the issue for tens of minutes at least, I just used observability tool which showed me the path in 2 minutes.reply",

I rebooted the backup server - no joy, even though it looked like the issue was there.  I restarted the proxies and things started working again.The error was basically: there are no available proxies, even though they were all available (but not working but not giving off \"not working\" vibes).I could bother with trying to look for what went wrong but life is too short.  This is the first time that pattern has happened to me (I'll note it down mentally and it was logged in our incident log).So, OK, I'll agree that a reboot should not generally be the first option.

      "interesting exercise and well written. my followon questions/work would be:1a. temperature=100000 is interesting too. obviously \"ideal\" temperature lies somewhere between 0 and 100000. has anyone ablated temperature vs intelligence? surely i'm not the first person to this idea. commonly people try to set temp=0 to get \"deterministic\" or \"most factual\" output but we all know that is just Skinner pigeon pecking.1b. can we use \"avg temperature\" as a measure in the way that we use perplexity as a measure? if we see temperature as inverted perplexity with some randomness thrown in, are they basically the same thing inverted? or subtly different?1c. what's the \"avg temperature\" of most human communication? whats the \"avg temperature\" of a subset of \"good writers\"? whats the \"avg temperature\" of a subset of \"smart writers\"?2a. rerun this negative exercise with constrained vocab to english2b. RL a model to dynamically adjust its own temperature when it is feeling 1) less confident 2) in brainstorm mode2c. dynamically inject negative temperature every X tokens in a decode, then judge/verify the outcome, to create high variance synthetic data?its hard for me to follow the train of thought on 2 because negative temp is essentially not that different from ultrahigh temp in practice.reply",

      "> commonly people try to set temp=0 to get \"deterministic\" or \"most factual\" output but we all know that is just Skinner pigeon pecking.Hmm? Given the same runtime, the same weights, and with the model actually giving deterministic output with temp=0, are you saying this isn't actually deterministic? Most FOSS/downloadable models tend to work as expected with temp=0 in my experience. Obviously that won't give you \"most factual\" output, because that's something completely else, but with most models it should give you deterministic output.reply",
      "\"What might be more surprising is that even when we adjust the temperature down to 0This means that the LLM always chooses the highest probability token, which is called greedy sampling.

      "Also from the article:\"Note that this is \u201crun-to-run deterministic.\u201d If you run the script multiple times, it will deterministically return the same result. However, when a non-batch-invariant kernel is used as part of a larger inference system, the system can become nondeterministic. When you make a query to an inference endpoint, the amount of load the server is under is effectively \u201cnondeterministic\u201d from the user\u2019s perspective\"Which is a factor you can control when running your own local inference, and in many simple inference engines simply doesn't happen.

The results are maximally weird.The notion of temperature comes from statistical mechanics. Consider a system that has states with energies E1,\u2026,EnE_1, \\dots, E_nE1\u200b,\u2026,En\u200b. If the system is in thermal equilibrium, the probability distribution over states is given by the Boltzmann distribution:The distribution is parameterized by a single number, the temperature TTT. At lower temperatures the lowest-energy states predominate; at higher temperatures there is a more even mix.At the last layer of a neural net, we apply the softmax function to the neuron activations {zi}\\{z_i\\}{zi\u200b} to get a vector of probabilities that sum to 1:Wait \u2014 this is just the Boltzmann distribution, up to a constant![1] \n\n[1]\nThere's no minus sign in the exponent because while higher-energy states are less likely, larger logits are more likely.\n"

      "> But what was the fire inside you, when you coded till night to see your project working? It was building.I feel like this is not the same for everyone. For some people, the \"fire\" is literally about \"I control a computer\", for others \"I'm solving a problem for others\", and yet for others \"I made something that made others smile/cry/feel emotions\" and so on.I think there is a section of programmer who actually do like the actual typing of letters, numbers and special characters into a computer, and for them, I understand LLMs remove the fun part. For me, I initially got into programming because I wanted to ruin other people's websites, then I figured out I needed to know how to build websites first, then I found it more fun to create and share what I've done with others, and they tell me what they think of it. That's my \"fire\". But I've met so many people who doesn't care an iota about sharing what they built with others, it matters nothing to them.I guess the conclusion is, not all programmers program for the same reason, for some of us, LLMs helps a lot, and makes things even more fun. For others, LLMs remove the core part of what makes programming fun for them. Hence we get this constant back and forth of \"Can't believe others can work like this!\" vs \"I can't believe others aren't working like this!\", but both sides seems to completely miss the other side.reply",

Compared to entering flow and churning out those tokens myself, which feels effortless once I get going.Probably other people feel differently.reply",
      "I'm the same way. LLMs are still somewhat useful as a way to start a greenfield project, or as a very hyper-custom google search to have it explain something to me exactly how I'd like it explained, or generate examples hyper-tuned for the problem at hand, but that's hardly as transformative or revolutionary as everyone is making Claude Code out to be.

Furthermore, why would I consider myself to have built it?When I enter a building, I know that an engineer with a degree, or even a team of them, have meticulously built this building taking into account the material stresses of the ground, the fault lines, the stresses of the materials of construction, the wear amounts, etc.When I make a program, I do the same thing. Either I make something for understanding, OR I make something robust to be used. I want to trust the software I'm using to not contain weird bugs that are difficult to find, as best as I can ensure that. I want to ensure that the code is clean, because code is communication, and communication is an art form \u2014 so my code should be clean, readable, and communicative about the concepts that I use to build the thing. LLMs do not assure me of any of this, and the actively hamstring the communication aspect.Finally, as someone surrounded by artists, who has made art herself, the \"doing of it\" has been drilled into me as the \"making\". I don't get the enjoyment of making something, because I wouldn't have made it!

      "Gentoo is the best! Once you get the hang of creating a bootable system and feel comfortable painting outside the lines, it feels like Linux from Scratch just without needing to manually build everything. I automated building system images with just podman (to build the rootfs) and qemu (test boot & write the rootfs, foreign arch emulation) and basically just build new system images once a week w/ CI for all my hardware + rsync to update. Probably one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever built, at this point I\u2019m effectively building my own Linux distro from source and it\u2019s all defined in Containerfiles! I have such affection for the Gentoo team for enabling this project, shocking to discover how little they operate on I\u2019m definitely setting up a recurring donation.reply",

      "Honestly this is just sorta a Tuesday for an advanced Gentoo user? There are lots of ways to do this documented on the Gentoo wiki. Ask in IRC or on the Forum if you can't find it. \"Catalyst\" is the method used by the internal build systems to produce images, for instance https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Catalyst.reply",

      "I would encourage you to write about it as well. It seems interesting and unconventional.I used to tinker a lot with my systems but as I gotten older and my time became more limited, I've abandoned a lot of it and now favor \"getting things done\". Though I still tinker a lot with my systems and have my workflow and system setup, it is no longer at the level of re-compiling the kernel with my specific optimization sort of thing, if that makes sense. I am now paid to \"tinker\" with my clients' systems but I stay away from the unconventional there, if I can.I did reach a point where describing systems is useful at least as a way of documenting them. I keep on circling around nixos but haven't taken the plunge yet. It feels like containerfiles are an easier approach but they(at least docker does) sort of feel designed around describing application environments as opposed to full system environments. So your approach is intriguing.reply",
      "I would also be very interested in reading that blog post!reply",
      "I think it is a great learning opportunity, but after using Gentoo for a decade or so, I prefer Arch these days. So if you want to learn more about Linux and its ecosystems, go for it, do it for a few months or years.That said, I haven't tried Gentoo with binaries from official repositories yet. Maybe that makes it less time-consuming to keep your system up to date.reply",
      "Been happily and very successfully using the official binpkgs, it works really well, sometimes there's a slight delay for the binary versions of the source packages to appear in the repositories, but that's about it. I guess it's kind of running Arch, but with portage <3! And the occasional compilation because your use flags didn't really match the binariesreply",
      "For me, the most underrated takeaway here is the state of RISC-V support.While other distributions are struggling to bootstrap their package repositories for new ISAs and waiting for build farms to catch up, Gentoo's source based nature makes it architecture agnostic by definition. I applaud the risque team for having achieved parity with amd64 for the @system set. This proves that the meta-distribution model is the only scalable way to handle the explosion of hardware diversity we are seeing post 2025. If you are building an embedded platfrm or working on custom silicon, Gentoo is a top tier choice. You cross-compile the stage1 and portage handles the rest.reply"

      "The idea of Claude having \"anterograde amnesia\" and the top-rated comment there by Noosphere89 really resonated with me:  \"I would analogize this to a human with anterograde amnesia, who cannot form new memories, and who is constantly writing notes to keep track of their life. The limitations here are obvious, and these are limitations future Claudes will probably share unless LLM memory/continual learning is solved in a better way.\"\n\n  This is an extremely underrated comparison, TBH. Indeed, I'd argue that frozen weights + lack of a long-term memory are easily one of the biggest reasons why LLMs are much more impressive than useful at a lot of tasks (with reliability being another big, independent issue).\n\n  It emphasizes 2 things that are both true at once: LLMs do in fact reason like humans and can have (poor-quality) world-models, and there's no fundamental chasm between LLM capabilities and human capabilities that can't be cured by unlimited resources/time, and yet just as humans with anterograde amnesia are usually much less employable/useful to others than people who do have long-term memory, current AIs are much, much less employable/useful than future paradigm AIs.reply",
      "For a coding agent, the project \"learns\" as you improve its onboarding docs (AGENTS.md), code, and tests. If you assume you're going to start a new conversation for each task and the LLM is a temp that's going to start from scratch, you'll have a better time.reply",
      "But that's the thing: Claude Plays Pokemon is an experiment in having Claude work fully independently, so there's no \"you\" who would improve its onboarding docs or anything else, it has to do so on its own. And as long as it cannot do so reliably, it effectively has anterograde amnesia.And just to be clear, I'm mentioning this because I think that Claude Plays Pokemon is a playground for any agentic AI doing any sort of long-term independent work; I believe that the solution needed here is going to bring us closer to a fully independent agent in coding and other domains. It reminds me of the codeclash.ai benchmark, where similar issues are seen across multiple \"rounds\" of an AI working on the same codebase.reply",
      "Yeah but it feels terrible. I put as much as I can into Claude skills and CLAUDE.md but the fact that this is something I even have to think about makes me sad. The discrete points where the context gets compacted really feel bad and not like how I think AGI or whatever should work.Just continuously learn and have a super duper massive memory. Maybe I just need a bazillion GPUs to myself to get that.But no-one wants to manage context all the time, it's incidental complexity.reply",
      "I agree with essentially everything you said, except for the final claim that managing context is incidental complexity. From what I know of cognitive science, I would argue that context management is a central facet of intelligence, and a lot of the success of humans in society is dependent on their ability to do so. Looking at it from the other side, executive function disorders such as ADHD offer significant challenges for many humans, and they seem to be not quite entirely unlike these context issues that Claude faces.reply",
      "This actually matches my experience quite well. I use vision (often) to try and do 2 main things in Claude code:1) give it text data from something that is annoying to copy and paste (eg labels off a chart or logs from a terrible web UI that doesn't make it easy to copy and paste).2) give it screenshots of bugs, especially UI glitches.It's extremely good at 1), can't remember when it got it wrong.On 2) it _really_ struggled until opus 4.5, almost comically so, with me posting a screenshot and a description of the UI bug and it telling me \"great it looks perfect! What next?\"With opus 4.5 it's not quite laughably as bad but still often misses very obvious problems.It's very interesting to see the rapid progression on these benchmarks, as it's probably a very good proxy for \"agentic vision\".I've came to the conclusion that browser use without vision (eg based on the DOM or accessibility trees) is a dead end, simply because \"modern\" websites tend to use a comical amount of tokens to render. So if this gets very good (close to human level/speed) then we have basically solved agents being able to browse any website/GUI effectively.reply",
      "I wonder if there's someone at Antrophic working to fine-tune the model's pokemon playing ability specifically.Maybe not but it sure would be funny.reply",

Scanning is maintained by a single person.Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers.
