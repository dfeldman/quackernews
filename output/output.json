      "Noob question from someone with little real CS experience, when the README for this project says:> verifying the correctness of codeWhat is the difference between \"verifying\" the correctness of code, as they say here, vs \"proving\" the correctness of code, as I sometimes see said elsewhere?Also, is there a good learning resource on \"proving\" things about code for working programmers without a strong CS / math background?Edit: I'm also very curious why \"zero knowledge\" proofs are so significant, and why this is so relevant. Eg I heard people talking about this and don't really understand why it's so cool: x.com/ZorpZK",
      "A very good resource for both verifying code and functional programming is Software Foundations (https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu).One note though: Verus and the tool Software Foundations works with (Coq) take different approaches to proving things.Verus attempts to prove properties automatically using something called an SMT solver, which is an automated system for solving constraints. Coq on the other hand, requires you to manually prove much more, offering a more limited set of automations for proving things.Both have their advantages and disadvantages, namely that automation is great when it works and annoying when it doesn't.(Another side note: Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are kind of something different. A great many people who work in formal verification/proof don't touch ZKPs at all (ex: me). They are better thought about as a cryptography primitive)",
      "Verifying and proving are used synonymously, as made clear later in the opening paragraph.As for zero knowledge proofs, there is little practical use, significance, or relevance to them due to the overhead involved and the lack of a \"killer app\", so to speak. But they're conceptually interesting.",
      "Whenever I hear people talk about the lack of practicality of some mathematical construct, I always remember G H Hardy who worked on number theory at the turn of the century. One of his famous quotes I love is:> I have never done anything 'useful.' No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world.Despite his self-proclaimed focus on pure mathematics, Hardy's work, particularly in number theory, has had profound applications in cryptography and other fields.I agree about the overhead. The costs have come down significantly already but they still remain a few orders of magnitude too large. That being said, it\u2019s killer app is cloud compute. Right now the only way to amortize the cost of HW is to run it on someone else\u2019s computer, which brings along with it all sorts of security and privacy risks. Well-performing ZK proofs (which we don\u2019t know if it exists / it may be a long time before we figure out how to do it) would \nlet you do cloud computing securely without worrying about vulnerabilities in your cloud provider\u2019s network. Like all cryptography, it\u2019s a double-edged sword because the same techniques would let websites deliver code for your machine to execute that you have no knowledge of what it\u2019s doing.",
      "Do you ever think about the many more folks who worked on stuff that really was completely useless and nobody remembers? \"Whenever I hear people talking about how the lottery is a waste of money with net negative expected returns, I think about the person I saw on TV who did win.\"Cloud compute might be a good use case. But the overhead would have to come down dramatically for it to ever beat simply doing the compute in-house and incurring the overhead of managing a physical rack. Which is (and always has been, and likely always will be) an extremely viable option for anyone who is seriously interested in data access control.",
      "> As for zero knowledge proofs, there is little practical use, significance, or relevance to them due to the overhead involved and the lack of a \"killer app\", so to speak. But they're conceptually interesting.This is just plain wrong. There are numerous applications in the blockchain space where the overhead is tolerable because they provide properties (privacy, succinct verification) that other techniques cannot provide.Their relevance to blockchains has led to massive reductions in the overhead, making it quite plausible that ZKPs will find use in settings where integrity is a must.For example, you could prove that a particular binary is the resulting of compiling source code that satisfies particular properties, such as memory safety. This would allow you to skip unnecessary safety checks.",
      "For a tool to be of \"practical use, significance, or relevance\" requires that the work it produces also is of \"practical use, significance, or relevance\". Blockchains are not."

      "I have been using CBMC to formally verify C for six, make that seven years now (edit: time flies). The latest release is actually pretty good.The secret to model checking is to understand that you're building and verifying a specification in code. It works best if specifications are built function by function. For each function, I'll build \"shadow functions\" that simplify any functions it calls with a range of potential non-deterministic behavior that matches that function's contract. In this way, formal specifications can be built from the ground up by first verifying a lower-level function and then replacing it with a shadow function that mimics its behavior in a non-deterministic but SMT solver friendly way.There are things that model checking doesn't do well. Anything with recursion or looping that can't be easily broken down will not perform well with a model checker. While algorithms like balanced binary trees or sorting can be broken down in a way that can be model checked, other algorithms may require the sort of induction one gets with constructive proofs to sufficiently verify. There is an art to this which will lead to style changes in C and a slightly different way of building up functions from pieces that can be trivially model checked. Honestly, that's not a bad thing.For the parts that can't be easily model checked, I'm working on a C parser library that can be formally verified, which will import C directly into Coq or Lean. I consider that the \"last mile\" before formal methods in firmware and system software is to the point that it's generally available.",

Costs for ITER are estimated to 45 to 65 billion USD it's one of the most ambitious and costly science projects in the world to date.

The extremely high capital costs would likely mean that fusion is unlikely to ever match solar or wind in energy production costs.I'm not opposed to fusion/plasma research, we have much insights into nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behaviour due to this research, I disagree with the notion that this is a field that achieves incredible outcomes with small budgets, that's far from reality.",

      "Conclusion from the paper is:In this paper we present a new model to explain the behavior of Large Language Models. Our frame of reference is an abstract probability matrix, which contains the multinomial probabilities for next token prediction in each row, where the row represents a specific prompt. We then demonstrate that LLM text generation is consistent with a compact representation of this abstract matrix through a combination of embeddings and Bayesian learning. Our model explains (the emergence of) In-Context learning with scale of the LLMs, as also other phenomena like Chain of Thought reasoning and the problem with large context windows. Finally, we outline implications of our model and some directions for future exploration.Where does the \"Cannot Recursively Improve\" come from?",
      "Looks like someone edited the title of this thread. I assume \"Cannot Recursively Improve\" was in the old one?",
      "Yeah, looks like it. This is better!",
      "I didn't read through the paper (just the abstract), but isn't the whole point of the KL divergence loss to get the best compression, which is equivalent to Bayesian learning? I don't really see how this is novel, like I'm sure people were doing this with Markov chains back in the 90s.",
      "Theoretically this sounds great. I would worry about scalability issues with the Bayesian learning models practical implementation when dealing with the vast parameter space and data requirements of state of the-art models like GPT-3 and beyond.Would love to see practical implementations on large-scale datasets and in varied contexts. I Liked the use of Dirichlet distributions to approximate any prior over multinomial distributions.",

      "There is a way to do this same compression by utilizing the raw probability distributions that the LLM produces as output. Fabrice Bellard has some experiments with doing this with transformers: https://bellard.org/nncp/The idea is that if you can produce an accurate probably distribution over the next bit/byte/token, then you can compress things with an entropy compressor (huffman encoding, range encoding, asymmetric numeral systems, etc). This comment is too small of a space to explain fully how they work, but it suffices to say that pretty much every good compression algorithm models probability distributions in some way.",

      "I read In Praise of Idleness when I was 13-14 because an older person recommended it to me. Although the essay was written in the 1935, he convinced me this was the future, and that it foretold what European life was going to be. And indeed, modern Western Europe lives this way -- where leisure is accorded importance, hard work is not the highest virtue, and citizens were free to create culture and invent new ideas. As evidence, he pointed to all the discoveries made by medieval monks and people with idle time to play with ideas, as opposed to the proletariat who worked but did not have the luxury to think higher thoughts. Idleness was thus the pre-condition for great ideas.In a sense, this is the vision of UBI -- where basic needs were met, and people were free to self-actualize.This is also the happy version of tenure in academia -- where you didn't have to worry about \"publish or perish\" but instead you get to work on really important ideas without showing results for years (multi year grants or being in a place like the IAS helps).Google in some ways used to operate like this before the current pivot -- many googlers lived a life of \"resting and vesting\" while wandering about for years looking for a big idea with little pressure to deliver anything.I definitely found this vision attractive, but as I grew older, I realized that it was not entirely tenable in it purest form. Yes, the best ideas certain came from having time to wander and work on different things (you get more creative working on multiple decorrelated ideas at the same time rather than one big idea), but in my experience, complete idleness without pressure to deliver anything does not work. I don't know if I believe the premise of In Praise of Idleness any more. We no longer live in a simple world. In a complex world, great ideas come from incrementalism, and keeping busy and making progress seems to be necessary in many domains in order get to the big idea because all the low hanging fruit have been plucked.",
      "I think Russel, like many scientists, feels the need to dangle \"the next big idea\" as a tantalizing reason to allow more idleness. I do think that in an important sense, he is right and you are wrong, that \"pressure to deliver\" is not as necessary as you think, and that the world has not changed so much since his time so as for him to have once been right but now be wrongHowever, I think this takes for granted the primacy of \"big ideas\" as the sole organizing principle we should arrange the world to efficiently produce, by force if necessary. I think the real argument for UBI is that self-determination is a core value, that the negotiations we make to better society neither need nor should involve a gun to the head of every person not born into wealth. I also think that overvaluing efficiency, expediency, and generally speaking impatience is pushing our species off a cliff",
      "Another complication is that boredom was easier to come by in 1932. There are far more things competing with far more sophistication for our attention today. Boredom is underrated!",
      "Low-hanging fruit depletion is a problem, but there are ways of dealing with it:- A larger number of people searching for the next Newtonian apple all over the place.- A smaller number of larger groups that pursue a narrow area with intense focus. That\u2019s more like \u201cwork\u201d though.- New areas. Especially software. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple were created by tinkerers with the privilege of free time. This process did not yet stop.To your other point, not every idle person will pursue new knowledge. And that's ok. A larger number of idle people will contain a larger number of tinkerers.",
      "I do wonder if the problem is not enough, or too much idleness.Isaac Newton is regarded as a genius, but he worked on really basic stuff like calculus and Newtonian mechanics.  Of course it was harder, when he and his competitors were inventing it.Sure, we handle more complex stuff now. But modern highschool material used to be really complex. Eventually theory, frameworks, language, and pedagogy, develop around a field that make it look deceptively simple. That\u2019s still incrementalism but incrementation comes from the next generation that grew up in an environment where our discoveries are table stakes.Is it possible that you no longer live in a simple world, because you\u2019ve become an expert, and moved on from ingesting the refined model from the previous generation, to either applying the current unrefined model to the hardest problems it can handle, or to building the model for the next generation?",
      "Re: your last paragraphI would say there's a mid-point somewhere between overworked 60-hour-a-week employees burning out and folks doing absolutely nothing productive. The nature and environment of work is important too, if you're tilling a farm there's an upper limit on your output, but with the internet anyone can be made to feel inadequate for not \"hustling\"/\"grinding\" enough.",
      "Maybe low hanging fruit only hang low in hindsight. There\u2019s a kind of control-certainty associated with some things, we got this, and there are some things where we at least know what we need to work on. Other things are more vague. So we now have more of the first category (in some areas) and this makes the apples appear to be lower than they were and most likely still are.",
      "It comes down to honesty. Are you idle because you want to be idle or are you just being lazy and not going after the opportunity right before you? Are you not pursuing the low-hanging fruit out of principle or is your ego holding you back from doing humbler things?If you can be honest with such questions then the duality goes away and everything boils down to doing the right thing",
      "This is not about idleness or laziness at all. It's about working for the man versus doing what you want to do.",
      "Right, how do you know what you want to do is not sleeping 15 hrs a day versus getting inspired by some idea"
