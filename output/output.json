It is a system for correctly exploiting information or bias in a gambling situation. It is also known as a maximally aggressive or high variance strategy, in that betting more than the Kelly selection can be quite ruinous.\nI recently ran into a strange card game where the Kelly strategy is risk free with zero variance. Peter Winkler calls the game \u201cNext Card Bet\u201d in his remarkable book Mathematical Puzzles. The problem and solution appear to come from Thomas Cover. I find this betting game and its analysis amazing, and want to share them with you here.\nThe game is played as follows. A standard 52 card deck consisting of 26 red cards and 26 black cards is shuffled and the player start with a stake of $1. Each card is exposed one at a time, without being replaced in the deck. The player is allowed to bet any fraction of their current stake on whether the next card is black o"

Interlinking local capacity / having one or two neighbors with fully fledged systems is way better than going weeks charging stuff in your car.

Hurricanes also tend to sweep up any other systems in the region, so once they disperse, it's pretty clear skies. Anecdotally, we didn't get any rain for months after Helene dissipated.Also, diesel and gas were pretty much inaccessible for the first 5 days of the disaster, so unless you have a stockpile that's been treated for longevity, you might not even be able to run your whole home generator for long.\n \nreply",

Its radio signals, traveling at the speed of light, currently need 23 hours to reach Earth.The Dwingeloo telescope was built in 1956, by what is now ASTRON, Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy.

And component definitions include defining properties, attributes, styles, etc.These things are being proposed for HTML, so Heximal is somewhat of a polyfill for HTML from the future.

      "I think \"single HTML file\" sets up a certain expectation that a five-thousand-line long HTML file with ~3500 lines of embedded JS doesn't really live up to. I mean, hey, everything can be a single HTML file if you embed the bundle inline in your HTML!Cool project, though - don't mean to take away anything from it.\n \nreply",
      "I totally understand your take, but as a guy that spends most of his time on side projects working on single HTML files, I have a different perspective.I find the totally self-contained nature of them very appealing because it travels well through space and time, and it's incredibly accessible, both online and offline.My current side project is actually using a WebDAV server to host a wide variety of different single HTML file apps that you can carry around on a USB drive or host on the web. The main trick to these apps is the same trick that TiddlyWiki uses, which is to construct a file in such a way that it can create an updated copy of itself and save it back to the server.I'm attracted to this approach because it's a way to use relatively modern technologies in a way that is independent from giant corporations that want to hoover up all my data, while also being easy to hack and modify to suit my needs on a day-to-day basis.\n \nreply",
      "tiddlywiki brings back memories ... never had been so optimistic about computers!\n \nreply",
      "Out of curiosity why WebDAV vs loading the HTML straight from disk wherever they are and having a service that's only needed to for saving changes?Edit: I sketched out a basic version in JS + Python, it's fairly ok to use. The nice parts about this approach is the HTML files are viewable without any extra services, and the service that enables saving doesn't itself need configuration or to keep state.\n \nreply",
      "I think I'd call that \"local-first\" or perhaps \"offline-first\". I can't think of a reason why a local-first app would need to be crammed into a single HTML file, hehe. I do agree it's very cool, though!\n \nreply",
      "I tried to allude to this in my response above, but the fundamental reason that they're all crammed into a single file is to make sharing really easy. This is what I meant when I said it travels well through space.\n \nreply",
      "Same reason excel business apps are one file - easy to move around and share without dependencies going missing!\n \nreply",

I also have an idea for something I call a link trap where you can rapidly just drop links in and then search and sort over them to quickly retrieve something you saw before that was interesting.

      "I loved this paragraph:> This dichotomy gels really well with the way my brain works. I\u2019m able to channel short bursts of creative energy into precisely mapping the domain or getting type scaffolding set up. And then I\u2019m able to sustain long coding sessions to actually implement the feature because the scaffolding means I rarely have to think too hard.It's why I keep begging my team, every time there's a new codebase (or even a new feature), to stop throwing `any` onto everything more complicated than a primitive. It is exhausting. It forces me to waste energy on the shitty, tedious parts. It forces me to debug working code just to find out how it works before I can start my work.They tend to take the quickest solution to everything -- which means everyone else has to do the same work over and over again until someone (me, invariably) sits down and makes a permanent record of it.In doing this they ensure that I can't trust any of their code, which is counterproductive for what should be obvious reasons. Every time I work on established, untyped (or poorly typed) code, it's like I'm writing new code with hidden, legacy dependencies.\n \nreply",
      "The longer I\u2019m in this industry, the more I find that there are two types of programmers: those who default to writing every program procedurally and those who default to doing so declaratively.The former like to brag about how quickly they can go from zero to a working solution. The latter brag about how their solutions have fewer bugs, need less maintenance, and are easier to refactor.I am squarely in the latter camp. I like strong and capable type systems that constrain the space so much that\u2014like you say\u2014the implementation is usually rote. I like DSLs that allow you to describe the solution and have the details implemented for you.I personally think it\u2019s crazy how much of the industry tends toward the former. Yes there are some domains where going the time from zero to a working product is critical. And there are domains where the most important thing is being able to respond to wildly changing requirements. But so much more of our time and energy is spent maintaining code than writing it in the first place that upfront work like defining and relating types rapidly pays dividends.I have multiple products in production at $JOB that have survived nearly a decade without requiring active maintenance other than updating dependencies for vulnerabilities. They have had a new version deployed maybe 3-5 times in their service lives and will likely stay around for another five years to come. Being able to build something once and not having to constantly fix it is a superpower.\n \nreply",
      "> Yes there are some domains where going from the time from zero to a working product is critical. And there are domains where the most important thing is being able to respond to wildly changing requirementsI agree with your observations, but I'd suggest it's not so much about domain (though I see where you're coming from and don't disagree), but about volatility and the business lifecycle in your particular codebase.Early on in a startup you definintely need to optimize for speed of finding product-market fit.  But if you are successful then you are saddled with maintenance, and when that happens you want a more constrained code base that is easier to reason about.  The code base has to survive across that transition, so what do you do?Personally, I think overly restrictive approaches will kill you before you have traction.  The scrappy shoot-from-the-hip startup on Rails will beat the Haskell code craftsmen 99 out of 100 times.  What happens next though?  If you go from 10 to 100 to 1000 engineers with the same approach, legibility and development velocity will fall off a cliff really quickly.  At some point (pretty quickly) stability and maintainability become critical factors that impact speed of delivery.  This is where maturity comes in\u2014it's not about some ideal engineering approach, it's about recognition that software exists to serve a real world goal, and how you optimize that depends not only on the state of your code base but also the state of your customers and the business conditions that you are operating in.  A lot of us became software engineers because we appreciate the concreteness of technical concerns and wanted to avoid the messiness of human considations and social dynamics, but ultimately those are where the value is delivered, and we can't justify our paychecks without recognizing that.\n \nreply",
      "Agreed 100%. Other benefit is fearless refactoring since API changes appear as type errors.With no type-checking you need to gamble testing all codepaths.\n \nreply",
      "> I personally think it\u2019s crazy how much of the industry tends toward the former.It's because most people who use technology literally don't care how it works.  They have real, physical problems in the real world that need to be solved and they only care if the piece of technology they use gives them the right answer.  That's it.  Literally everything programmers care about means nothing to the average person.  They just want the answer.  They might care about performance if they have to click the same button enough times, and maybe care about bugs if it's something that is constantly in their face.  But just working is enough...\n \nreply",
      "It\u2019s not crazy, you have a million instructions and you\u2019re just going to write all of that out in a single declaration or a list of procedures?First off the declaration is better as it\u2019s less error prone but it comes at the cost of being harder to write and harder to interpret.Imagine if we communicated with one declarative run on sentence. No paragraphs at all\u2026Procedures are default and easier to our nature as humans.\n \nreply",
      "Why is `any` allowed at all? Enable strict mode, set up your linter, don't allow any implicit or explicit `any` anywhere.Without this, Typescript is next to useless. Not knowing if the types are good is worse than no types at all.\n \nreply",
      "FYI, TypeScript strict mode does not prevent explicit `any` (only implicit `any`).You'd need to reach for something like https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-explicit-any/\n \nreply",
      "Progressive typing of an untyped code base. Types that are too complex to represent in that type system.\n \nreply",
      "Yep, adopting strict after the fact is a different conversation, but one that has been talked about a bunch and there is even tooling to support progressive adoption.Types that are too complex... hmmmm - I'm sure this exists in domains other than the bullshit CRUD apps I write.

Most of it is influenced by the inordinate amount of time I\u2019ve spent working on the Heartbeat codebase, a 300k+ line Typescript full-stack application that includes a React web app, a React Native mobile app and a Node.js server. My experience in this codebase has shown me that the more I lean into relying on the type system, the more I benefit.Writing code in a codebase that has fully bought into types feels like cheating. I can often implement 80% of a new feature without ever running the code. I\u2019ll start working on a large refactor that requires breaking an assumption made throughout the code & quickly discover that the type system makes the change trivial.

My daily work is to convert carbon-bearing gases into diamond through plasma chemistry. I've long considered making diamond knife blades, although recent literature searches have put me off a bit, given their demonstration that brittle ceramic blades like Zirconium oxide shed sharp microparticles that I doubt are good for the ingester.Nevertheless, I have made several small solid diamond blades (~15 cm long) that I've used to cut filet mignon. With load cells attached, the draw force to cut with a diamond blade is <20% of the draw force needed for an equivalent steel blade coated with titanium nitride and overcoated with a thin Teflon layer, about 5% of the draw force required by a custom Japanese knife. I have one diamond blade in my kitchen that I use as a paring knife. It's the very best tool I own.I'm gratified that our ancestors figured out how to make superlatively sharp blades knowing essentially nothing of the science underlying their work.

      "It's a bit of a nitpick, but I hate the term \"Damascus steel\" used in this context. This is pattern-welded steel, which was first called Damascus by Bill Moran in 1973. It offers few (if any) benefits that a solid billet of a single high-quality steel wouldn't, and it offers none that the original Damascus was said to have.Damascus steel was originally a crucible wootz steel that came from India or Iran and was sold to Europe through Damascus. The alternating colors came from the grain structure of the steel, not from different steel types layered together. As far as I am aware, we still do not know the exact process used to create it, although we have come close, and it's likely that modern CPM (Crucible Particulate Metallurgy) steels surpass it due to more consistent measurements for the components of the alloy.I am only an amateur blacksmith, but I have spent the last 15 years dreaming and researching to prepare myself. Given that I live in an apartment, I am limited to a small mobile forge that I can wheel out to the complex's grill area where I am actually allowed to have a fire, which limits the projects I can do due to the forge size and temperature. Crucible steel is a dream one day, but for now I just nitpick and try to tell people about the original Damascus, which is (in my opinion) much more fascinating than what gets the label today.\n \nreply",

Having experienced instructors helped with the beginning learning curve, plus they pointed out early pitfalls to avoid (like gripping the hammer too tight). While useful, you definitely don't need to take a class to get started. There's dozens of tutorials on making a basic forge on Youtube - either coal-burning or propane - and you can get started with something as basic as a sledgehammer head for your anvil. Even a Harbor Freight cast iron anvil is enough for a beginner, although they're more likely to crack.My starting costs were reduced by gifts, and my dad giving me an anvil he made with a piece of railroad several years ago. A basic gas forge from Vevor is around $75, but you can make your own small one from a coffee can, some refractory wool, and a handheld propane torch.Right now, I just make tools and trinkets for myself.

Many dared not enter this lawless zone that had developed a reputation as a place to be avoided, somewhere that harbored vice and illicit trades. A place where triads and criminals were in control and those brave enough to enter risked having their cameras smashed or worse their throats slit;1 apparently at odds with the rest of Hong Kong.It was often considered an anomaly, a place defined through difference from its context and little has been written to understand it beyond this limited scope. This opinion of the area was placed firmly into view when a Chinese government spokesman described the Walled City strikingly as \u201ca problem left over from history,\u201d2 essentially claiming it w"

      "Another thing that happens to outdoor grown cannabis is pesticide contamination.  Even if your farm is a good distance from some commercial agriculture, if they spray it can, and does, contaminate your crop -- which for regulated cannabis requires destruction.  Literally burning (or composting) thousands of dollars of product.And if the pesticides test are hot on the cross-contaminated cannabis; how much is on those apples three fields over?\n \nreply",
      "Wouldn't composting risk having the pesticides go into the next crop further contaminating?Although, to your point, they can just sell it to the nearby farms growing stuff we eat that isn't tested the same way...\n \nreply",
      "Typically, and USA specific, the rules are to grind it up, mix with equal parts existing dirt/compost and then it's OK.  So that dilutes it by half; then this compost is spread around and, like you said, can be used for other crops.  Also, as the material sits in the compost pile, which should be agitated, the pesticides will leach out/break down.I just got a message from WA-LCB today with updated pesticide information, working with WSU, so here's some details -- https://agr.wa.gov/departments/cannabis/pesticide-useAnd here's the Action Limits defined in WA law: https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=314-55-108\n \nreply",
      "Many asterisks here but there are methods for remediating herbicide and pesticide contamination. Not saying it\u2019s universally solved, but its not universally unsolvable either.Edit: I meant to speak specifically in terms of compost production.\n \nreply",
      "> which for regulated cannabis requires destructionWhich regulation is this that requires destroying a nearby crop... instead of the one the pesticide was actually applied to?  I'm confused here.  Pesticides don't \"contaminate\" crops in that way, they're literally intended to be use on the food.\n \nreply",

      "The fact that cannabis is so genetically unstable is very interesting. The root cause of the problem is that the level of CBD or THC produced by the plant in the resin is a result of polygenic expression\u2014 in other words, even if you have two strains of CBD-dominant crop, pollination can still result in increased THC in the next generation of the plant.\n \nreply",
      "For the love of Fuck, just legalize it, what are we doing here?Worried it will be too much? Limit max THC % and max amount you can buy in a given span of time.Thankfully, this is one of those issues that will just be GONE once the boomers die off, so this sort of idiocy won't be around too much longer.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah we really just need to demand scientific, evidence-based policy and be fine on this topic.It's going to be weird being \"boomer\" / old af ourselves (I'm in my 40s) telling people about the days when it was illegal, the way it'd be boomer af for someone to tell us about Prohibition days.On the other hand, western society seems to be swinging more authoritarian again, e.g. abortion laws in the US, AfD here in Germany, despite cannabis legalisation efforts in both.
