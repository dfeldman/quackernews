      "It's fascinating how differently languages approach the string formatting design space.- Java's been trying to add f/t-strings, but its designers appear to be perfectionists to a fault, unable to accept anything that doesn't solve every single problem possible to imagine: [1].- Go developers seem to have taken no more than 5 minutes considering the problem, then thoughtlessly discarded it: [2]. A position born from pure ignorance as far as I'm concerned.- Python, on the other hand, has consistently put forth a balanced approach of discussing each new way of formatting strings for some time, deciding on a good enough implementation and going with it.In the end, I find it hard to disagree with Python's approach.

      ">I tried to explain how review workflows work in a PR-based setup, and gave concrete suggestions for how we could improve the process. But they didn\u2019t want to try it. That might sound like a small thing, but at that stage, all I wanted was a smooth and efficient collaboration process. The easier it was for me to track changes, the better.I'm surprised the copy editor was more comfortable using git than using a web-based review tool to leave comments, especially given that she was reviewing a Go book and didn't seem to know what Go was.How does that even happen? It seems bizarre that Manning had this copy editor at all.I recently had a negative experience with Manning. I sent them an email saying that I'm in the process of writing a book, and I'm self-publishing it, but I was curious about the possibility of applying to Manning for a second edition. I asked whether they accept second editions after a self-published first edition and what document formats they accept.I got back a form letter telling me that they'd rejected my proposal. When I followed up and said I didn't send a proposal but was asking preliminary questions, they told me that they understood I hadn't sent a proposal, but they were going off of the table of contents on my book's website. I guess they decided to pre-emptively reject me?They also only said Google Docs as a document format, but based on this blog post, clearly they accept AsciiDoc.\n \nreply",

      "This is a long essay, and here is my pitch as to why you should read the whole thing if you have any interest in subjects like C programming, binary formats, kernel modules, or assembler.Breadbox, the author, wants to make smaller binary executables. He explains about ELF binaries, a.out binaries, old MSDOS .COM binaries, and how the later had no metadata, and could be very small. He then explains how you can dynamically load code that deals with new executable binary formats into the Linux kernel, and how this process works. He walks through some sample C for building a \"Hello World\" kernel module. He then walks you through ~1 page of code for a kernel module that registers a new binary format, sets up some callbacks, and if conditions are right, will vm_mmap() the code into memory and call start_thread() on it.Yay, it works! He has a tiny binary. This is where most articles would end, but Breadbox goes deeper. What if you want a stack and a heap? What if you want to access argc, argv, and envp? What if you want to append code at the end that automatically calls the exit syscall? All these details are covered, and I think it's glorious.While this all may seem like pretty dry stuff, there is humor sprinkled throughout, which makes it more fun to read.\n \nreply",

      "I really like picking up arcane UNIX/Linux knowledge. In the 90s, I was asked in an interview by a wizened old UNIX greybeard what the brk system call did, and what I would think if I saw it pop up frequently in the strace output of a program I was trying to diagnose. I did not then know the answer to that question, and I subsequently bombed the rest of that interview. If I would have read this article I could have told him stood for \"program break\" and mentioned that it was an end-of-heap marker, and that I should expect that the program was calling malloc (which was then implemented with brk) a lot. I probably would have still bombed the other interviews, but I could have at least momentarily impressed the crusty old sysadmin.Nowadays however, interviewers are rarely impressed with what arcane knowledge you may or may not have, regardless of how hard won the experiences were that taught it to you.I was reminded of this when reading the \"Demystifying the shebang\" article today on HN when I saw it in some strace output, which along with the other similarities got me to thinking about this article.\n \nreply",

      "Less fun fact: you can't substitute a <cr><nl> for <nl>.I had a Perl script (way) back in the day that came from a Windows system and it wouldn't work on Linux. After I figured out <cr><nl> was causing the problem, I figured it out what bin_script (might have been in bin_misc) was doing wrong. bin_script sees \"/bin/perl<cr>\" and then fails to find that interpreter.So I proposed a one line change which fixed the glitch and posted it to LKML \u2026 and promptly got yelled at by Allan Cox for breaking compatibility. I dunno if the null byte breaks the same compatibility. Chapter and verse weren't cited.\n \nreply",
      "Null de facto works, and it's almost certainly due to a consequence of the kernel treating the result of extracting the argument as a C string. For instance, it might actually be scanning past the NUL and earnestly finding the newline. Even if that entire datum is copied into the argument vector and passed to the interpreter. the interpreter will only see the argument up to the null terminator, due to it being a C string.About the only way it could break would be if the kernel used a string function to look for the newline, like a range-limited form of strchr, and then aborted the hash bang dispatch with an error upon not finding the newline, rather than accepting that the argument is delimited by a null.I tested it on various platforms like MacOS, Solaris, some BSDs, Cygwin, Linux. Far from exhaustive but a good coverage of the modern desktop and server landscape.The null byte would have fixed your Perl script without having to convert the line endings; the argument would have been delimited, in spite of the line ending in <CR><LF>.\n \nreply",

      "Read your article, it's really nice. I really feel much less demystified by this.But can you / somebody please explain what this meansAccording to the official Kernel Admin Guide:This Kernel feature allows you to invoke almost (for restrictions see below) every program by simply typing its name in the shell. This includes for example compiled Java(TM), Python or Emacs programs. To achieve this you must tell binfmt_misc which interpreter has to be invoked with which binary. Binfmt_misc recognises the binary-type by matching some bytes at the beginning of the file with a magic byte sequence (masking out specified bits) you have supplied. Binfmt_misc can also recognise a filename extension aka .com or .exe.It\u2019s another way to tell the Kernel what interpreter to run when invoking a program that\u2019s not native (ELF). For scripts (text files) we mostly use a shebang, but for byte-coded binaries, such as Java\u2019s JAR or Mono EXE files, it\u2019s the way to go!Like, can you give me an example by what you mean. What are its use cases, if any. I read it many times and always with some sort of enthusiasm because of this sentence ending in exclamation point making me feel like it's huge yet I just can't understand it's significance.Does it mean we can have .jar files which can then run shebang like, so we don't need #! , can this also be used for main.go or every other language which has some issues with #! ,I see there being some interpreter for golang, rust etc. which just compiles it but it was just too complex. I am just imagining something like a simple go file which is valid golang but can be run by linux simply by ./ And it autocompiles it...\n \nreply",

It simply sees that you tried to run a PE file and will run it in wine.\n \nreply",

Thanks to the shebang, you don\u2019t need to explicitly invoke their interpreters. For example, there are two (very confusing) programs to create a user on Linux: useradd and adduser. One of them is the actual program that will create the user in the system, the other one is a utility that will create the user, the home directory and configure the user for you.

This does not seem to be a case where the human expertise and artistry is actually important to the final product, besides the feeling of tradition.Perhaps the best argument for keeping traditional jobs like this is that, even if that exact job could be done by machine, replacing these humans with machines would be the start of a short process that would end up with indistrially-produced bad cheese.\n \nreply",

You're still a computer scientist doing computer engineering work just on a different problem set.Lamp lighter to cheese tapper is a profession change. A lamp lighter with bad hearing or attention to detail is not a problem per se. Tapping cheese to see if its ripe (and all the other skills that come with cheese making) will potentially be different enough.Now the problem comes in, when lamp lighter is supposed to start doing OCR engineering work.

      "I know I will probably get pushback over this, but CalDAV sucks.  People say that it's great and that it's easy; yet if that were true there would be way more self-hosted CalDAV solutions out there and they would be far more ergonomic than what's available.  I was not impressed with Radicale.  Because there's really only one calendar file I wanted to serve to myself, I tried implementing my own CalDAV server just for that purpose and pretty much gave up because of how unintuitive and complicated it was merely to make a single file available.  I can see why it would be needed if sharing a calendar with other people with calendar apps that support CalDAV, but I think it's kind of a waste of time if hosting a calendar for one's self.Instead, initially went with the approach of hosting my dynamically updating iCal file in an S3 bucket and using ICSx5 on Android to sync with it.  No CalDAV needed \u2013 just HTTPS.However, FOSS calendars for Android still suck, and for some reason I couldn't get ICSx5 to work within GrapheneOS, so I now use almost the same approach but with Proton Calendar which happens to support calendars from direct links to iCal files.  It's not perfect, but it suits my needs enough.I think the author's approach for using iCalendar format is a good one, though what I've discovered is the amount of support for various iCalendar features varies drastically between calendar software.  Rather than dealing with that headache, I somewhat gave up and decided to shove most metadata into the description field rather than use the respective properties.EDIT: My use case is software I wrote to grab data from various sites (Eventbrite, Meetup, pub trivia companies, public event calendars, etc.), filter for only social events I would be interested in, and combine them into a single calendar I can view in my normal calendar software.\n \nreply",

If you simply add 604800 seconds to the TAI, that meeting will be at 14:00, which is surprising. OK, easy enough to solve; convert the TAI back to the local timezone, add 7 to the day field (carrying into month and year, as needed), and you're good to go. Now suppose that the meeting was set up in the US, and you realized that you needed to reschedule the meeting while you were travelling in Germany. You get back to the US, and suddenly the meeting is an hour early, because DST rules aren't universal.Worse, imagine a recurring meeting, every week at noon. You've got the TAI for the original instance, but as you cross a DST boundary, some places will shift according to DST and others won't, and thus you have half the attendees showing up at the wrong time.Finally, TAI introduces the leap second bug for calendars. When you schedule a meeting for noon next year, you want that to happen at noon, not now plus however many seconds.

      "I feel like it needs a comparison with https://kro.run/ and crossplane v2 which makes it more generic and less cluster scoped.\n \nreply",
      "I thought Crossplane v2 was only a design proposal at the moment: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pull/6255But I guess there is an actual preview implementation now? https://docs.crossplane.io/v2.0-preview/The comparison on Kro would definitely be good to include as there are quite a few similarities. I can write up more on how it compares in a bit.\n \nreply",
      "Koreo and Kro share a lot of similarities in that both allow you to build abstractions that encapsulate a lot of complexity. For instance, in Kro you could implement a ResourceGraphDefinition that builds a \"Workload\" abstraction that produces a Workload CRD that, say, lets you specify a container image, a database, and a bucket. Then when you create an instance of this CRD, Kro might map this to a Lambda function, RDS instance, and an S3 bucket, perhaps using ACK for example. In Koreo, this would be a Workflow that has various ResourceFunctions which produce the Lambda, RDS, and S3 bucket. Just like with Kro, this would be triggered off of a CRD. In essence, both let a platform team (or whoever) provide high-level APIs that encapsulate resource management.One difference is just in how the two approach doing this. Koreo takes an approach of providing primitives that can be composed or reused and, importantly, are actually testable (since testing is a first-class thing in Koreo). This lets you more easily validate automations but also makes it easier to provide \"building block\" like components that can be shared between Workflows.Another difference is in how Koreo solves configuration management. Rather than relying on string templating or unstructured YAML overlays, Koreo treats configuration as structured data. This allows you to specify and tweak configurations in a predictable and typesafe way by transforming, validating, and composing them programmatically. Koreo is very much modeled after functional programming principles, so we can, for instance, define functions that validate preconditions or apply standard tags to resources in an environment. This model also enables configuration reuse and overrides across teams and environments without introducing tight coupling or duplication. Instead, we can apply configuration \"layers\" to build up a resource. Kro really focuses more on resource orchestration and leaves the configuration management up to the user.\n \nreply",
      "Also, what's interesting about Koreo is that you can actually build \"meta\" Workflows. That is, Workflows that produce Workflows, meaning you could implement something like Kro itself in Koreo fairly easily. This is why it's really closer to a programming language and runtime for programming Kubernetes control loops.Koreo would also allow you to implement a workload spec such as Score rather easily for the same reason. https://score.dev\n \nreply",
      "Yes, those were exactly my thoughts after reading the introduction. It seems the new meta is adding another meta (heh) level on top of Kubernetes, and kro seems to be the most promising at the moment.\n \nreply",
      "Just one more YAML bro I swear trust me bro just one more meta level will solve everything just one more yaml please I promise you it's not bad just write yaml it's simple and clean just some more yaml man just one more yaml file you will certainly not regret it just add one more yaml(Congratulations on the launch, looks interesting!)\n \nreply",
      "I wrote the core engine behind this and your comment made me laugh pretty hard because I agree.  I debated a lot about the best syntax and we experimented with various alternatives approaches. The core engine actually isn't YAML centric at all, in fact it doesn't use YAML\u2014it is just data structures in and out.We wound up exposing this as YAML purely because there's a lot of tooling out there for dealing with YAML. I am not sure if that's a good reason or not....  Writing the language server was quite nasty because of that choice! Our hope was that the language server and structural type checking (which is very simplistic at the moment) and testing framework can make it feel more like a real language and less YAMLy.\n \nreply",
      "I think I can see some of where this could be utilized, but I think I'm still missing a step and I'm hopeful someone can fill me in.There's a comparison against Argo Workflows, but with the description here and in other comments, Koreo seems to be aiming more for what I would use Argo CD for - managing the entire state of the cluster, the controllers, configuration, etc. Because of it tying into repos, you can then define the entire state of your cluster in code, and Argo CD has tools for doing some of the interpolation of variables into your YAML.The project looks cool, and I don't think that the world suffers from having multiple ways of doing something, I just want to understand it better.\n \nreply",
      "My understanding of Argo CD is limited so forgive me but I believe Koreo is a bit more similar to Argo Workflows. Where the scripts and logic is baked into the Argo Workflow image, in Koreo it leverages other K8s controllers to do the heavy lifting of interacting with the APIs. If I understand Argo CD correctly, it is an implementation of Argo Workflows. In this way, you are able to build your own CI/CD workflow via Koreo if you so wanted.\n \nreply",
      "I feel I've built something similar using fluxcd + cuelang. FluxCD allows having order through depends on and how you organize your Kustomization resource.\nI still believe the FluxCD project needs a UI that matches what you can get from the cli. CLI has so many features that you might or might not get fully from the available UI's.\n \nreply"

Honestly, I completely forgot you could do this (too much time with react I guess?). So now there's only one top level event listener.

These can stack.There are lots of obvious and interesting applications here in LLMs - there's some research showing that LLMs have honesty/dishonesty parameter groupings, for instance.But, I can't really figure out what this OT map is. Is it a single layer tensor? Is it multidimensional? If it's the size of the original model (which they say it is not), then I understand how to apply it - just add weights and rerun.

Agents (like us and others) are 3D and dynamic, while the multiverse is 4D static spacetime.

      "For those who are curious, `...` is a placeholder value in Python called Ellipsis. I don't believe it serves any real purpose other than being a placeholder. But it is an object and it implements `__eq__`, and is considered equal to itself. So `...==...` evaluates to `True`. When you prefix a `True` with `-`, it is interpreted as a prefix negation operator and implicitly converts the `True` to a `1`, so `-(...==...)` is equal to `-1`. Then, you add another prefix `-` to turn the `-1` back into `1`.`--(...==...)--(...==...)` evaluates to `2` because the first block evaluates to 1, as previously mentioned, and then the next `-` is interpreted as an infix subtraction operator. The second `-(...==...)` evaluates to `-1`, so you get `1 - -1` or `2`.When chaining multiple together, you can leave off the initial `--`, because booleans will be implicitly converted to integers if inserted into an arithmetic expression, e.g. `True - -1` -> `1 - -1` -> `2`.> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.This article is obviously completely tongue-in-cheek, but I feel the need to point out that this sentence is not meant to be a complete inversion of the Perl philosophy of TIMTOWTDI. The word \"obvious\" is crucial here - there can be more than one way, but ideally only one of the ways is obvious.\n \nreply",

      "Thank you!I noticed some ** and * in the thing sent to eval(), which (given that the building blocks are small integers) seemed related to prime factorizations.The initial %c is duplicated 21 times (3*7, if I read correctly), and then string-interpolated (%c%c%c...) against a long tuple of integers. These integers themselves are composed of products of factors combined using * and **.There is also one tuple \"multiplication\" embedded within that long tuple of integers -- (a,b)*2 = (a,b,a,b). That is for the 'l' 'l' in \"hello\".It's all very clever and amusingly mathy, with a winking allusion to the construction of natural numbers using sets. It made me Godel.\n \nreply",
