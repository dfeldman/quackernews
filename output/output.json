      "This project looks like a very nice lightweight way to implement policy in a Rust application; I really like the ergonomics of the builder. Despite being very different systems, the core permissions check being the same signature as a call to SpiceDB[0] (e.g. the subject, action, resource, and context) shows the beauty of the authorization problem-domain regardless of the implementation.I would like to add some color that a policy engine is not all you need to implement authorization for your applications. Without data, there's nothing for a policy engine to execute a policy against and not all data is going to be conveniently in the request context to pass along. I'd like to see more policy engines take stances on how their users should get that data to their applications to improve the DX. Without doing so, you get the OPA[1] ecosystem where there are bunch of implementations filling the gap as an afterthought, which is great, but doesn't give a first-class experience.[0] https://spicedb.io[1] https://openpolicyagent.org\n \nreply",

How do we know it requires problem solving skills? Because memorization-only LLMs can't do it but humans can.I think ARC are producing some great benchmarks, and I think they probably are pushing forward the state of the art, however I don't think they identified anything particular with o3, at least they don't seem to have proven a step change.\n \nreply",
      "The reason these tasks require fluid intelligence is because they were designed this way -- with task uniqueness/novelty as the primary goal.ARC 1 was released long before in-context learning was identified in LLMs (and designed before Transformer-based LLMs existed), so the fact that LLMs can't do ARC was never a design consideration. It just turned out this way, which confirmed our initial assumption.\n \nreply",
      ">> The reason these tasks require fluid intelligence is because they were designed this way -- with task uniqueness/novelty as the primary goal.That's in no way different than claiming that LLMs understand language, or reason, etc, because they were designed that way.Neural nets of all sorts have been beating benchmarks since forever, e.g. there's a ton of language understanding benchmarks pretty much all saturated by now (GLUE, SUPERGLUE ULTRASUPERAWESOMEGLUE ... OK I made that last one up) but passing them means nothing about the ability of neural net-based systems to understand language, regardless of how much their authors designed them to test language understanding.Failing a benchmark also doesn't mean anything. A few years ago, at the first Kaggle competition, the entries were ad-hoc and amateurish. The first time a well-resourced team tried ARC (OpenAI) they ran roughshod over it and now you have to make a new one.At some point you have to face the music: ARC is just another benchmark, destined to be beat in good time whenever anyone makes a concentrated effort at it and still prove nothing about intelligence, natural or artificial.\n \nreply",
      "I mostly agree with what your are saying but\u2026> passing them means nothing about the ability of neural net-based systems to understand language, regardless of how much their authors designed them to test language understanding.Does this implicitly suggest that it is impossible to quantitatively assess a system\u2019s ability to understand language? (Using the term \u201csystem\u201d in the broadest possible sense)Not agreeing or disagreeing or asking with skepticism. Genuinely asking what your position is here, since it seems like your comment eventually leads to the conclusion that it is unknowable whether a system external to yourself understands language, or, if it is possible, then only in a purely qualitative way, or perhaps purely in a Stewart-style-pornographic-threshold-test - you\u2019ll know it when you see it.I don\u2019t have any problem if that\u2019s your position- it might even be mine! I\u2019m more or less of the mindset that debating whether artificial systems can have certain labels attached to them revolving around words like \u201cunderstanding,\u201d \u201ccognition,\u201d \u201csentience\u201d etc is generally unhelpful, and it\u2019s much more interesting to just talk about what the actual practical capabilities and functionalities of such systems are on the one hand in a very concrete, observable, hopefully quantitative sense, and how it feels to interact with them in a purely qualitative sense on the hand.

      "Hey HN, Greg from ARC Prize Foundation here.Alongside Mike Knoop and Fran\u00e7ois Francois Chollet, we\u2019re launching ARC-AGI-2, a frontier AI benchmark that measures a model\u2019s ability to generalize on tasks it hasn\u2019t seen before, and the ARC Prize 2025 competition to beat it.In Dec \u201824, ARC-AGI-1 (2019) pinpointed the moment AI moved beyond pure memorization as seen by OpenAI's o3.ARC-AGI-2 targets test-time reasoning.My view is that good AI benchmarks don't just measure progress, they inspire it. Our mission is to guide research towards general systems.Base LLMs (no reasoning) are currently scoring 0% on ARC-AGI-2. Specialized AI reasoning systems (like R1 or o3-mini) are <4%.Every (100%) of ARC-AGI-2 tasks, however, have been solved by at least two humans, quickly and easily. We know this because we tested 400 people live.Our belief is that once we can no longer come up with quantifiable problems that are \"feasible for  humans and hard for AI\" then we effectively have AGI. ARC-AGI-2 proves that we do not have AGI.Change log from ARC-AGI-2 to ARC-AGI-2:\n* The two main evaluation sets (semi-private, private eval) have increased to 120 tasks\n* Solving tasks requires more reasoning vs pure intuition\n* Each task has been confirmed to have been solved by at least 2 people (many more) out of an average of 7 test taskers in 2 attempts or less\n* Non-training task sets are now difficulty-calibratedThe 2025 Prize ($1M, open-source required) is designed to drive progress on this specific gap. Last year's competition (also launched on HN) had 1.5K teams participate and had 40+ research papers published.The Kaggle competition goes live later this week and you can sign up here: https://arcprize.org/competitionWe're in an idea-constrained environment.

Semi Private Eval - 120 tasks that are exposed to 3rd parties. We sign data agreements where we can, but we understand this is exposed and not 100% secure. It's a risk we are open to in order to keep testing velocity. In theory it is very difficulty to secure this 100%. The cost to create a new semi-private test set is lower than the effort needed to secure it 100%.4. Private Eval - Only on Kaggle, not exposed to any 3rd parties at all. Very few people have access to this. Our trust vectors are with Kaggle and the internal team only.\n \nreply",

No real way to find something that's not emitting something.Regardless, this method is probably more intended for scenarios like nuclear accidents where you don't really have to worry about someone hiding the source from you.

      "I feel like Delphi, along with maybe VB6 and WinForms, have been the pinnacle of easy UI development, and things have gone significantly downhill since then. Especially on the web side, where even a single view sometimes requires having multiple unrelated dependencies (packers, builders, transpilers, etc.), often implicitly-configured to produce output, in head-space. And due to this dependency hell, when porting a project like this to a new platform, or just getting it to run, a slight change in the environment silently breaks the build.\n \nreply",
      "Agree, Delphi was extremely nice way to do UI development.. I've made many small GUIs for everyday tasks back when I was using it.Unfortunately \"dependency hell\" was very real -- it was super-easy to download ActiveX controls, install on the system, and then depend on them in the apps. Worse, Windows had a single ActiveX database per computer, and an control installed by a completely unrelated app would appear in the Delphi's palette, ready to be placed on a form. After having a few apps that would not work on friends' computers, I've mostly gave up on ActiveX components completely.. luckily third-party Delphi components were better - at least the compiled binaries would work. Source code still required system-wide install though...If you think that \"pip install\", or \"npm install\", or even \"apt-get install\" on a Linux system is bad, you haven't seen what Delphi world was like. But to be fair, it's not really Delphi's fault - all Windows development was like that, full of bespoke settings that need to be set on each PC. For a complex software, it was normal to spend a few days just setting up the system so you can do initial build.Another Delphi-specific issue was that by default forms were specified in pixels, and were hard-coded to specific font sizes; and color pickers had hardcoded colors (as opposed to system theme colors) prominently displayed. Unless you were very careful, it was very easy to make an app that could not handle different font or screen theme. And many apps that would benefit greatly from being resizable were non-resizeable instead, just because it was easier.\n \nreply",
      "FWIW ActiveX specifically was really more so that Delphi is able to use the Visual Basic stuff than something native to Delphi. Components made for Delphi specifically are (usually) compiled as part of the final executable without needing ActiveX.In fact AFAIK ActiveX support in Delphi was implemented by generating a wrapper component that converted the ActiveX control stuff to what Delphi \"naturally\" speaks.For forms, even in Delphi 2 you can use the \"align\" property in several controls to automatically position them inside a container using the top, bottom, left, right and client area. The areas also stack so you can, e.g., position several controls at the top area and you'd get an effect similar to what a VBox container would provide in other toolkits. Though the initial versions of Delphi did not have this available everywhere, it was added to various controls over time.Later versions also added \"anchors\" so that you can drag-drop stuff visually to the form but also have them resize automatically based on the parent's size. Lazarus (sort of open source Delphi-like IDE) extended this to allow anchoring stuff related to other control (so, e.g., you could have a button's right side a few pixels from another button's left side and that button's right side be a few pixels from the container's right side, or have a label be placed at the middle of an input box, or other stuff like that).\n \nreply",
      "Delphi and Visual Basic 6 were definitely not the pinnacle of UI development.For example, all layout was pixel based. Making windows resizable required much complex ad-hoc code, and internationalization was hard as well. Very early in my career, I have spent person months clicking through every single screen in a large desktop application to find words cut off due to words having different lengths (measured in pixel) in different languages. I knew what \"Ok\" and \"Cancel\" meant in half a dozen languages. At the time, Java was really breaking ground with container based layouts in Swing. Delphi and Visual Basic caught up only in the .NET era.\n \nreply",
      "Don't know about VB6, but at least Delphi had Align property and TPanel/TGroupBox. Together, it allowed to make apps that handle resizing just fine without any custom logic.(it has been a very long time, but I think those only handled internal composition and not overall window size.. so you'd still need some custom code if you wanted dialogs as compact as possible. But as long as you never missed setting Align property, you did _not_ have to manually resize every control for different text/font size).\n \nreply",
      "You can\u2019t look at the language in isolation. Visual Basic was backed by the fantastic Visual Studio for development. That ecosystem was way more mature than Java ever got with Swing et al. IMO, if there\u2019s one thing MS ever did right, it was how they nailed WYSIWYG GUI app development.

This simplified UI design sufficiently enough that VB/Delphi provided an optimal solution that, yes in hindsight, would most accurately be described as a \"local maxima\" for the environment and the time.> Making windows resizable required much complex ad-hoc codeI remember there were ActiveX controls one could drop onto their form that would attempt to derive the layout based on initial positioning of controls, i.e. that a lower row of buttons should be anchored to the bottom of the window, while textboxes are took up a larger area would automagically resize with the window.\n \nreply",

      "If 39 pages is too much for you, there's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Whitecoat#Seventh-da...\"\"\"Over the course of the 19-year program, more than 2,300 U.S. Army soldiers, many of whom were trained medics, contributed to the Whitecoat experiments by allowing themselves to be infected with numerous different kinds of bacteria that were considered likely choices for a biological attack. While some volunteered immediately after basic training, for conscientious objectors at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas (before they began their medic training), the near certainty of being assigned as a combat medic in Vietnam helped some medics choose instead to remain in the United States with the Whitecoat program. The goal of the program was to determine dose response for these agents.\"\"\"I attended an SDA high school and was a member of the church for a couple years in college (I dated an SDA woman). It was interesting that they had a ton of dentists, doctors, etc. and ran well-regarded medical schools, but also espoused young Earth creationism. They also were generally suspicious of government involvement in religion, with many worried about a \"national Sunday law\" and being disallowed from worshipping on Saturday. Conversely, this generally included a desire for religion not to get too involved in government, which I respected quite a lot.I never really believed, and left the church after breaking up, but I really miss the sense of community. Every Saturday I'd go to a service with a boring sermon but some _fantastic_ singing (the entire congregation could, and did, sing, and those walls rang with \"Down By The River To Pray\" in 4 part harmony), then have a vegetarian (albeit cheesy) potluck after, and then just chill at the beach with friends. Society would do well to adopt the sabbath as a cultural practice. The minister where I was seemed pretty chill with marriage equality - I remember he gave a sermon about marriage while people protested California's prop 8 outside and he pointed out how badly LGBT couple wanted marriage at the same time others took it for granted.I wonder if it's still like that.\n \nreply",

A manager must make the work challenging and rewarding so that his people will remain with the organization for many years. This allows it to benefit fully from their knowledge, experience, and corporate memory.\u201d~ Hyman Rickover, 1982\n \nreply",
      "We don't have time machines and so can't re-run the experiment. I've read biographies of Rickover and not all people who lived through this time are complementary.It's certainly true the strategic arms processes and nuclear submarine engineering benefited in a long term view.I just find myself asking if the US army recruiting tag line Be The Best You Can Be was really met, or if Rickover achieved what might be more akin to crystallography \"local optimum\" where there are better peaks out there, but this one is mine. (To borrow another army concept)Viewed from Australia the current state of US submarine construction is woeful. We're on the brink of being ripped off having prepaid for access to Virginia class subs soon, and AUKUS subs in future. We expect to be told we cannot have Virginia class subs ever, we cannot have longterm crewing or command ever, but we can host them retained in US HANDS and we can continue to pay for them.Not that Rickover made that happen,  but whatever his lessons are, the US submarine building industry doesn't seem to have learned then, or be able to apply them.\n \nreply",
      "He died in 1986, so everything in the Virginia program happened well after his death.  His forced retirement in 1982 was largely because he made a lot of political enemies by making a stink about General Dynamic's flaws in workmanship on the Los Angeles class.  His whole management style was to push for accountability and sweat the details.I think what you're country is seeing is general flaws in quality for basically everything American-made these days.  Which, if I'm being totally blunt, are because Americans are lazy and don't care about quality and basically do the minimum that won't get them fired.  Hell, I started my career caring about quality and craftmanship and now I do the minimum that won't get me fired too, because there's no point busting your ass for some lazy manager up the chain to take credit for it.\n \nreply",
      "Rickover's final testimony to congress in 1982 speaks about this:Corporate Power A preoccupation with the so-called bottom line of profit and loss statements, coupled with a lust for expansion, is creating an environment in which fewer businessmen honor traditional values; where responsibility is increasingly disassociated from the the exercise of power; where skill in financial manipulation is valued more than actual knowledge and experience in the business; where attention and effort is directed mostly to short-term considerations, regardless of longer-range consequences.Political and economic power is increasingly being concentrated among a few large corporations and their officers - power they can apply against society, government and individuals. Through their control of vast resources, these large corporations have become, in effect, another branch of government. They often exercise the power of government, but without the checks and balances inherent in our democratic system.With their ability to dispense money, officials of large corporations may often exercise greater power to influence society than elected or appointed government officials - but without assuming any of the responsibilities and without being subject to public scrutiny. Woodrow Wilson warned that economic concentration could ''give to a few men a control over the economic life of the country which they might abuse to the undoing of millions of men.'' His stated purposes was: ''to square every process of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set up at the beginning and have always carried in our hearts.'' His comments are apropos today.Summary: https://www.worldfuturefund.org/Articles/rickover.html Full testimony: https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/97th%20Congress/Economics...\n \nreply",

      "There's a quip about organizing sales orgs that resonates with me:Expect every salesperson in your company to optimize their own compensation. If you want to change their behavior, then change your sales compensation plan to drive the behavior you want.I don't think this is appreciated enough at the management and CEO level of engineering-based companies.How many engineering-tied metrics were explicitly part of Boeing's CEO's comp plan? If \"Boeing makes less money, but produces safer planes\" = more money to the CEO, then that happens.And yet we're suprised when, absent that, individuals act in their own self interest and optimize for bad engineering outcomes.\n \nreply",
      "Sales organizations are often the most game-theoretic rational folks in an organization: a large fraction of their compensation is directly attributable to recent efforts.That doesn't make them honest or efficient or trustworthy, just canny and responsive.By way of contrast, operations can only be seen negatively (if things are working, that's normal, and if things are not, that's bad) and development usually has conflicting incentives (stability! and features! and responsiveness! and bugfixes!) with cycle times and group responsibilites obscuring attribution.\n \nreply"
