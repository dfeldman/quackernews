      "So I laser weld, and beyond my own PPE, interlocks (gun won't fire if it's not touching metal, etc), the most important part of the whole setup is laser safety curtains.Because it's a 2500 watt laser, if i didn't have laser safety curtains , the relections/etc could very easily blind someone at a fairly long distance.The NOHD (nominal ocular hazard distance) is something like 10km (2500 watt laser, 0.06mm spot size, divergence is very very small).  The actual hazard distance is shorter, but still, kinda crazy.(as for why i have a laser welder - i got it cheap and besides the downsides above, it is very easy to weld ~anything without much skill.  A person who has never welded in their life can weld sheet metal and have it come out basically perfect in 5 minutes)\n \nreply",
      "Why don't welding/cutting lasers add more divergence with built-in optics? Would it hurt performance? It seems like you could add 1 mrad and it would hardly make a difference at the usual working distance, but spread out to a meter over 1 km, so you can't zap people across town.\n \nreply",
      "If it's a 1-micron wavelength laser with a 60 micron radius spot, the divergence can't be much less than about 5.7 mrad half angle. What makes eye safety tricky is just that 2.5 million milliwatts is a lot of power. Even when you spread it out some.\n \nreply",

      "Ideally you have an enclosed area with interlocks.  All of the laser welders support it (and it's the standard way).  They make and sell mobile ones that can be pushed around. See, e.g., https://lasersafety.com/barriers/rigid-barriers/ for some examples (I don't know these folks, they just have helpful pictures/listings of kinds of things that exist)If you can't do this, you do need to panel or curtain the ceiling or use laser absorption coating or other things.There are places that also just use reflection sensors that detect reflection on the ceiling and trigger (again, machines already support handling this).  I have heard this works very well but have no direct experience with it.All that said, reflection off ceiling is more uncommon for practical reasons (The angle at which you hold the gun to the piece, the fact that ceiling directed angles often become back reflection into the gun which it already detects, etc).They already detect very high reflection as well.For a makerspace, one of the issues you will have is that people will likely want to try to weld copper and aluminum a lot, both of which are highly IR reflective.If you said \"You can only weld steel and iron\" you would eliminate a very high percent of reflection in the first place.Here's a basic chart that looks right:\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomasz-Kurzynowski/publ...For a 1064nm laser, you can see Al or Cu is going to reflect a lot of the energy, while steel/iron are still off the graph high in absorption\n \nreply",

Austin is currently the tech lead for what we sometimes call the \u201cGo core\u201d, which encompasses compiler toolchain, runtime, and releases. Cherry Mui will be stepping up to lead those areas. I am not leaving the Go project, but I think the time is right for a change.It\u2019s important to remember that tech lead\u2014like any position of leadership\u2014is a service role, not an honorary title. I have been leading the Go project for over 12 years, serving all of you, and trying to create the right conditions for all of you to do your best work. Large projects like Go absolutely benefit from stable leadership, but they can also benefit from leadership changes. New leaders bring new strengths and fresh perspectives.

Object motion, deformation, occlusion, lighting changes, and other factors can vary dramatically from frame to frame. Videos are often lower quality than images due to camera motion, blur, and lower resolution, further increasing the difficulty.SAM 2 demonstrates improved accuracy in video segmentation, with 3 times fewer interactions than previous approaches. SAM 2 is more accurate for image segmentation and 6 times faster than the original Segment Anything Model (SAM).First, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:Due to a bug in the segment-anything-2 codebase, after installation, you need to run the command python setup.py build_ext --inplace.

      "This is coming from Dileep George and the Jeff Hawkins adjacent theories around hierarchical temporal memory, cortical columns, and much of the higher level theory around what it is that the brain is doing in its smallest, repeated functional units. They split some time back, but they're both quite rigorous and have done exciting research. This paper goes over allocentric framing of learning, allowing cortical networks to be built through learning and thinking over time, driving a more complex and nuanced model of the world to be built throughout the networks in the brain, where the hippocampus seems to hold the long term memory, with connections that feed back up to nearly every region in the cortex. It's not complete, but it abstracts a level away from phenomenological observations like the notion of Jennifer Aniston cells, or mirror neurons, or things that occur as a consequence of some underlying functionality. We're getting much closer to a complete picture of the algorithms underlying human intelligence, and those may unlock human level machine intelligence, the understanding of consciousness, and all sorts of great medicine and technology.

      "Agreed.Anecdotal (but deep) research led me to postulate that our entire \"inner world\", for lack of a better word, is an emergent construction based on a fundamentally spatiotemporal encoding of the external world. This assumes that feeding and motility, i.e., a geometric interpretation of the external world, is among the first 'functions' of living organisms in the evolutionary order. They subsequently became foundational for neuronal systems when these appeared about 500 million years ago.The hypothesis was informed by language notably, where most things are defined in spatial terms and concepts (temporal too, though more rarely), as if physical experiences of the world were the building blocks of thinking, really. A \"high\" council, a \"sub\" culture, a \"cover\", an \"adjacent\" concept, a \"bigger\" love, a \"convoluted\" or \"twisted\" idea, etc.Representations in one's inner world are all about shape, position, and movement of things in some abstract space of sorts.This is exactly how I'd use a 4D modeling engine to express a more 'Turing-complete' language, a more comprehensive experience (beyond movement: senses, intuitions, emotions, thoughts, beliefs\u2026): use its base elements as a generator set to express more complex objects through composition in larger and/or higher-dim space. Could nature, Evolution, have done just that? Iteratively as it conferred survival advantages to these genes? What would that look like for each layer of development of neuronal\u2014and later centralized \"brain\"\u2014systems?Think as in geometric algebra, maybe; e.g., think how the metric of a Clifford algebra may simply express valence or modality, for those neuronal patterns to trigger the proper neurotransmitters. In biological brains, we've already observed neural graphs up to 11 dimensions (with a bimodal distribution peak around ~2.5D and ~3.8D iirc\u2026 Interestingly for sure, right within the spatiotemporal ballpark, seeing as we experience the spatial world in 2.5D more than 3, unlike fishes or birds).Jeff Hawkins indeed strongly shaped my curiosity, notably in \"A Thousand Brains\" and subsequent interviews. The paper here immediately struck me as very salient to that part of my philosophical and ML research\u2014so kinda not too surprised there's history there.And I'm really going off on a tangent here, but I'm pretty sure the \"tokenization problem\" (as expressed by e.g. Karpathy) may eventually be better solved using a spatiotemporal characterization of the world. Possibly much closer to real-life language in biological brains, for the above reasons. Video pretraining of truly multimodal models may constitute a breakthrough in that regard, perhaps to synthesize or identify the \"ideal\" text divisions, a better generator set for (any) language.\n \nreply",

      "TL; DR \u201cWhile the medical profession had seen nothing wrong with tonics such as Coca-Cola advertising themselves to white, middle-class consumers for their aphrodisiac qualities, it became an entirely different matter when Black people used cocaine...Candler fought back against the damage that cocaine\u2019s declining reputation did to his brand\u2019s reputation, arguing that the small quantity of coca extract in Coke was merely energizing...But this strategy became less tenable in 1899, when the company expanded its sales of bottled coke to a national market. This meant that Coca-Cola was now available outside white soda fountains to anyone with a nickel to spare\u2014including Black men.\u201d\n \nreply"

Selling it to Black Americans was another matter.We all know that Coca-Cola once contained cocaine. But why? And why did they take it out? As Michael M. Cohen writes, the answer is all about the way authorities perceive drugs differently depending on the race and class of the people using them.Cohen writes that Coke was the brainchild of Dr. John Stith Pemberton, who was injured while fighting for the Confederacy and then became addicted to the morphine prescribed for pain relief. Living in Atlanta after the war, the physician tried the new wonder drug cocaine and found it cured his morphine problem. Like many other medical professionals of his time, he identified cocaine as a safe solution to conditions including the \u201cnervousness\u201d that plagued the white middle class\u2014not to mention impotence and sexual dysfunction.In 1884, Pemberton began selling cocaine-laced wine.
