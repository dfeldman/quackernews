At the 7B scale, we outperform the leading models of Mistral, Google\u2019s Gemma and Meta\u2019s Llama3 series in both quality and performance. We believe Zamba2-7B is the leading model for running on-device and on consumer GPUs as well as for many enterprise applications which require a powerful but compact and efficient model for natural-language tasks.Zamba2 performs exceptionally well on standard language modeling evaluation sets, especially given its latency and generation speed. Among small language models (<9B), we lead the pack in both quality and performance.Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for the following reasons:Due to the exceptional quality of our pretraining and annealing datasets, Zamba2-7B performs extremely well on a per-training-token basis, sitting comfortably above the curve traced out by competitor models.Zamba2 performs exceptionally well on standard language modeling e"

      "This is at least the 3rd version of this product idea that I\u2019ve seen in the past decade. Certainly the nicest design!The first time I saw this was some friends of friends who were trying to make it into a startup. They quickly discovered that their users liked the idea of a busy light for the office, but didn\u2019t like to update it on or off throughout the day. So after the first few days people just defaulted to leaving it marked as \u201cbusy\u201d. Within a week or two their coworkers realized that the light was always on busy, so they started asking if they were really busy.At that point, the entire busy light idea had been defeated.This product looks more versatile. Being able to automatically tie it to meeting status or set pomodoro timers could make it more interesting.However, I predict the same fate: Eventually people will realize the light is busy when the person isn\u2019t really busy, and then return to the old habit of interrupting to ask if they\u2019re busy.\n \nreply",
      "That seems like an easy fix: Tell visitors to look at the light.\n \nreply",
      "That\u2019s the problem: If the light is always on, or almost always on, then it quickly loses meaning.Unless the user actually adds green available time at regular intervals throughout the day, people learn that they have to ignore the red busy light and ask.\n \nreply",

      "During the solving of a problem on Project Euler, I learned that compilers are smarter than me.I don't remember the problem number or its title, but it involved starting from the top-left corner of a 2D grid and finding how many possible paths there are to get to the bottom-right corner while only moving either down or right.My naive solution was a brute-force depth-first recursive search.  On my CPU at the time, it took about 3 minutes to solve.  I thought, the logic of this is incredibly simple, why not do it in assembly?My assembly solution took 5 minutes.I decompiled the compiled C code to see what it had done, but I couldn't understand it.

      "Cool work! Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe to use the new OpenAI structured output that's more reliable, the response_format should be \"json_schema\" instead of \"json_object\". It's been a lot more robust for me.\n \nreply",
      "I may be reading the documentation wrong [0], but I think if you specify `json_schema`, you actually have to provide a schema. I get this error when I do `response_format={\"type\": \"json_schema\"}`:     openai.BadRequestError: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': \"Missing required parameter: 'response_format.json_schema'.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'response_format.json_schema', 'code': 'missing_required_parameter'}}\n\nI hadn't used OpenAI for data extraction before the announcement of Structured Outputs, so not sure if `type: json_object` did something different before. But supplying only it as the response format seems to be the (low effort) way to have the API infer the structure on its own[0] https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/s...\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019ve been using jsonschema since forever with function calling. Does structured output just formalize things?\n \nreply",
      "function calling provides a \"hint\" in the form of a JSON schema for an LLM to follow. the models are trained to follow provided schemas. If you have really complicated or deeply nested models, they can become less stable at generating schema-conformant JSON.Structured outputs apply a context-free grammar to the prediction generation so that, for each token generation, only tokens that generate a perfectly conformant JSON schema are considered.The benefit of doing this is predictability, but there's a trade-off in prediction stability; apparently structured output can constrain the model to generate in a way that takes it off the \"happy path\" of how it assumes text should be generated.Happy to link you to some papers I've skimmed on it if you're interested!\n \nreply",
      "Structured output uses \"constrained decoding\" under the hood. They convert the JSON schema to a context free grammar so that when the model samples tokens, invalid tokens are masked to have a probability of zero. It's much less likely to go off the rails.\n \nreply",
      "Stuff like this shows how much better the commercial models are than local models. I\u2019ve been playing around with fairly simple structured information extraction from news articles and fail to get any kind of consistent behavior from llama3.1:8b. Claude and chatGPT do exactly what I want without fail.\n \nreply",
      "OpenAI stopped releasing information about their models after gpt-3, which was 175b, but the leaks and rumours that gpt-4 is an 8x220 billion parameter model are most certainly correct. 4o is likely a distilled 220b model. Other commercial offerings are going to be in the same ballpark. Comparing these to llama 3 8b is like comparing a bicycle or a car to a train or cruise ship when you need to transport a few dozen passengers at best. There are local models in the 70-240b range that are more than capable of competing with commercial offerings if you're willing to look at anything that isn't bleeding edge state of the art.\n \nreply",
      "Any pointers on where we can check the best local models per amount of VRAM available?  I only have consumer level cards available, but I would think something that just fits in to a 24Gb card should noticably outperform something scaled for an 8Gb card, yes?\n \nreply",

OpenAI's API could be a cost-efficient tool for large scale data gathering projects involving public documents.OpenAI announced Structured Outputs for its API, a feature that allows users to specify the fields and schema of extracted data, and guarantees that the JSON output will follow that specification.For example, given a Congressional financial disclosure report, with assets defined in a table like this:You define the data model you're expecting to extract, either in JSON schema or (as this demo does) via the pydantic library:OpenAI's API infers from the field names (the above example is basic; there are ways to provide detailed descriptions for each data fi"

      "I've been using Payload for 18 months. They're only recently (with the upcoming v3 release) really piggy-backing on Next.js' server and routing. Before that, it was \"just\" a really nice headless CMS built on Node/TypeScript.This was obviously posted in the wake of the WordPress drama, but I landed on Payload while feeling stagnant after 10+ years building on WordPress. Everything else I was doing was 100% TypeScript, my entire professional career had been working with metadata driven data structure, I felt right at home with Payload.It's just enough structure (full admin area, API, GraphQL) to make scaffolding a basic site (with authentication) quite easy. I had built an app using Next 13 before Payload began integrating directly and using the local API (versus making HTTP calls to a server endpoint) is very clean. It feels like WordPress (i.e. you're editing \"client\" code on the \"server\") but with a LOT less cruft.Because it's headless, anything goes on the front end. One big reason that WP got so big was because of the theming capabilities. Payload has extensibility by way of plugins, but it's (obviously...) not as robust as what's available in the WP plugin repo. It'll be interesting to see how these alternatives fare against the more prescriptive tools like Ghost (which does support theming, but does not support custom fields in any way, shape, or form).That being said, I'm all in on Payload moving forward. If you're curious, go straight to the v3 beta -- it's very close to release and plenty stable, in my opinion. Happy to answer questions.(Not affiliated with Payload, just a big admirer of their work)\n \nreply",
      "How easy/hard would you consider the amount of work needed to create a ecommerce for digital products using Payload? I'm currently using WP + Woo but the plugins that I'm using aren't flexible enough and I'm re-inventing some of them, so might as well re-invent some more and learn Next.\n \nreply",
      "Payload has an e-commerce template, but it definitely pales in comparison to WooCommerce. I can't speak to specifics, but if I were looking to migrate away from WooCommerce, I'd look at MedusaJS (http://medusajs.com)\n \nreply",
      "how does it compare to Django as far as battery-included goes\n \nreply",
      "NextJS instead of templates. Full-featured admin area. I'd say Payload is more akin to Wagtail than Django itself. It feels ridiculously modern compared to other CMSes I've touched, Wagtail included. Payload doesn't prescribe i18n like Django.When you need to, you can step down into NextJS and write custom endpoints and the like.\n \nreply",
      "The pitch alone on PayloadCMS shows that this is still a developer-focused CMS. Just look at the difference between the github page, the Payload website, and wordpress.org's landing. This is not purely a marketing difference but a strategic conversation.I'm all about transitioning CMSes and yet WordPress has got the turnkey part of their open-source platform clear and easy to understand. You can self-host or choose a provider. Payload doesn't make that clear, it's either too dev-centric for running or wants you to \"Schedule a Demo\" (which is a way to capture enterprise dollars).What about more consumer-friendly pitches and deployments? Any recommendations on that?\n \nreply",
      "I work on Payload and this feedback is noted!You can deploy Payload anywhere you can deploy any Nextjs app, and as of v3, you'll be able to deploy it to serverless environments too like Vercel and Netlify. We'll work on adding more deployment guides directly into our docs for various platforms as well to help with this.Again, we read everyone's feedback about Payload itself and our website so it's very much appreciated and we'll be addressing this gap in how we present ourselves!edit: I may have misunderstood your initial point, oopsYeah we're not consumer facing in the way Wordpress is. It's quite a huge gap to fill\n \nreply",
      "So let me get this straight... PayloadCMS is a framework, for Next.js which is a framework for the React framework.Yo dawg, i heard you like frameworks!\n \nreply",
      "A common misconception. React is a library.These are examples for React frameworks: https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#production...Next.js is a React framework.If Payload is a framework or not is debatable. I think it's more like a data layer around a database for a any js app and an Admin Panel (that uses Next.js now). It might be called a framework for your own Headless CMS, because it is code first. So you basically code the panel and the data structure yourself.\n \nreply",
