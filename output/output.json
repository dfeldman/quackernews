      "Alphabetic writing really is incredible.Despite the fact that I personally prefer syllabaries. I can't discount the fact that alphabets have done an incredible job of being adopted by other languages that didn't previously have any sort of writing system. Alphabets are really flexible like that.The latin alphabet alone is used in all sorts of languages from English to Tukish, Indonesian and Swahili. Having this many diverse languages follow a single writing system is only really possible with alphabets. You couldn't do this with Chinese characters or Korean hangul, for example.\n \nreply",
      "Some informed speculation about this on languagehat, in the comments: https://languagehat.com/oldest-alphabet/\n \nreply",
      "I'm curious how they arrived at the conclusion it's an alphabet without deciphering it.\n \nreply",
      "Normally researcher will make a statistical distribution and compared it with the existing deciphered alphabets for example the most popular is the yet to be deciphered Indus script against the popular Egyption script or Egyptian hieroglyphs.The Indus script research findings on it being a script was so controversial that the researcher had a death threat upon him based on the discovery.I think the OP article author is wrong by claiming it's the oldest while it should be the Indus script [1].[1] Indus script:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_script\n \nreply",
      "Right.  4 clay cylinders inch-long, perforated, with geometric symbols on the outside, are not jewelry (otherwise found in the same tomb) but ... labels with a new form of writing because... they were found next to the pottery?The article is brilliantly written to lead with the significance of such a find before providing evidence.\n \nreply",
      "The article is well cited. They handily beat out newspapers by providing links to earlier blog posts on the research.You might want this one: http://www.rollstonepigraphy.com/?p=921> I will convey my own perspective regarding these four inscribed clay cylinders: namely, the script is Early Alphabetic (based on the clear morphology of the letters), the language is arguably Semitic, and the date is early (based on the secure archaeological context and carbon 14 dates).> My initial thought (because of the graphemic shapes of the signs on the cylinders and the clear similarity to Early Alphabetic letters) was that these cylinders might be intrusiveSo, the major argument that they're writing is that they look very similar to other writing that we can read. Imagine that you can read Latin, but not Greek, and you're confronted with some inscriptions in Greek. Should you call them writing?\n \nreply",
      "\"\u4e47\u4e42\u3112\u5c3a\u5342\" looks like \"EXTRA\", but it's (meaninglessly-arranged) Chinese characters with a purely coincidental relationship to the Latin.Did they find a bunch of these artifacts, with a variety of inscriptions? If so then sure, I buy it. If it's just the \"CHON\" fragment - that could well be coincidence.\n \nreply",

      "ahmedfromtunis's comment was killed, presumably because he attributed it to Gemini, but it was correct on the facts. Here's the response I wrote to him:-----Count of symbol types is what you'd look at. You have a bunch of unknown symbols, so there's nothing else you can look at.For comparison:Japanese hiragana: ~71 symbols [*]Cherokee syllabary: ~86 symbolsGreek alphabet: ~24 symbolsLatin alphabet: ~21 symbols ( https://ancientgraffiti.org/Graffiti/graffito/AGP-EDR187776 )[*] Many Japanese syllables are spelled with digraphs (\"sh\", if the \"h\" appeared in a special combining form) or diacritics (\"\u00e8\", if \u00e8 and e were completely distinct sounds, as they are in French), which lowers the memory burden. I've counted diacritics as creating new symbols and digraphs as not doing so.\n \nreply",

Alphabetic writing changed the way people lived, how they thought, how they communicated,\" said Glenn Schwartz, a professor of archaeology at Johns Hopkins University who discovered the clay cylinders. \"And this new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined b"

The integrations offer a vastly superior experience than messing around with VirtualBox and Vagrant by hand (been there, done that) to achieve running Docker on one's development machine.\n \nreply",
      "Rancher desktop is also a viable option and free. Many including my work moved to it after Docker's new licensing kicked in.IMO the real magic of Docker was the Docker/OCI image format.

      "Completely agree. I moved from docker desktop to rancher after an update blew away my kubernetes cluster, and then from Rancher to Orbstack due to a number of bugs that were crashing the underlying VM.

      "Docker Desktop on Mac is a handicapped, underprivileged mess. Docker cli for Mac with Colima is still underprivileged, but at least you can skip the bs license and Docker's gui. On Windows you can at least use Docker on WSL which works great. Why use Docker Desktop is beyond me.\n \nreply",
      "> Why use Docker Desktop is beyond me.I lived through a failed attempt to migrate from Docker Desktop for Mac to an open source alternative (minikube+portainer, IIRC). A lot of test scripts developers relied on \u2013 to run parts of the integration test suite on their laptops for debugging \u2013 broke, because Docker Desktop for Mac went to a lot of effort to make macOS look like you were running Docker on Linux, whereas the open source replacement wasn't as seamless. Some of these test scripts contained Java code directly talking to the Docker daemon over its Unix domain socket, so need the same API implemented. Many other scripts made heavy use of the Docker CLI. After spending a lot of time on it, it was decided to just go back to Docker Desktop for Mac. The failed migration had resulted in highly paid engineers spending time pulling their hair out trying to get test scripts to work instead of actually fixing bugs and delivering new features.Now, that was 2+ years ago now, and maybe the open source alternatives have caught up since, or maybe we picked the wrong one or made some other mistake.

      "I was following this discussion on the /r/chipdesign subreddit when Ken posted there a few days ago.  Nice to see that he gave credit and linked to that thread.I'm a physical design engineer that uses software from Cadence and Synopsys to do chip layout of blocks with billions of standard cells.  Our flow automatically puts antenna diodes in for all block input pins.  Then the tools are usually good enough to breakup internal nets with layer jumping to avoid antennas.Some of the charge also comes from the CMP process.  Modern chips have about 20 layers of metal but there are lots of other via layers in between those and then all the base layers with the actual transistors.  You want the wafer to be flat before building the next layer.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical-mechanical_polishing\n \nreply",
      "Fun fact about \"antennas\" in chip manufacturing: They have nothing to do with actual antennas. Charge can build up on long wires during manufacturing because the chemicals involved are not neutral and have some interactions with exposed wires. That charge needs to go somewhere to protect the rest of the circuits. There's nothing RF about this.Later technologies (28 nm and below) have extensive design rules around prevention of \"antenna\" effects.\n \nreply",
      "I think that\u2019s incorrect. The article and the Wikipedia page on the antenna effect say antenna effects are caused by plasma etching, which uses RF to create the plasma.\n \nreply",
      "It's a bit confusing. The plasma is created by RF, but the RF doesn't cause the antenna effect (nor do \"chemicals\"). The charged ions and electrons in the plasma are what cause the charge buildup. The wire acts as an antenna in a metaphorical sense, not a literal sense, as I mentioned in Footnote 3.\n \nreply",

It's been very cool to see your die analyses ramp up to more and more complex chips over the years.

Industry is already performing and incentivized to provide these capabilities better than NASA.

      "In my last year of university (5 years ago) I took a networking seminar. Each student took a look at a different technology to utilize multiple links for internet data transfers.Initially I was amazed by MPTCP and wondered why it had so little adoption. As I looked into the papers I slowly figured out why. With different links (WLAN, LAN, LTE) their real world characteristics are too different for efficient aggregation. It is the head of line blocking problem times ten.It might be fine as a back up link, but there are other problems like the limit to TCP and middelboxes dropping unknowns packets.\nThe challenges outnumber the benefits for consumers and in data centers there are other technologies to aggregate links that operate on a level below TCP.\n \nreply",
      "People underestimate how often MPTCP is actually used. Siri has been using it for ages and has since expanded their MPTCP usage to many other built in apps. At some point MPTCP became available to all apps on iOS. Any network with an iPhone connected to it is using MPTCP, whether you know it or not.When you're using TCP, you can enable MPTCP for free and make your connections faster and more stable. If you're not using TCP, there are alternatives, but then MPTCP is completely irrelevant anyway. You can use QUIC if you want to bypass shitty middleboxes, for instance, as that has similar features but smuggles itself past shitty middleboxes by being marked as UDP (which also makes it more likely to get dropped when the network is congested, unfortunately).\n \nreply",

      "It needs server side support, but the OS just supports it out of the box. On linux enabling multi path is I believe just a configuration flag and then it just works.\n \nreply",
      "I imagine re-ordering is a big problem. The only application I can think of that would require a single flow is media streaming, but you only need ~4Mbs for a decent quality stream anyway. Other applications like file transfer can be split into multiple concurrent flow, at which point you might as well just let the local router nat each flow to each internet connection in turn.\n \nreply",
      "I routinely ship 50mbit media streams over the internet, and sometimes streams up in the 200mbit range. In campus streams are up in the 10gbit range.Over bonded networks bitrate are typically under 40mbit, and usually under 20Of course none of this uses tcp.\n \nreply",
      "Instead of trying to aggregate by packet, wouldn't it be more effective by managing sessions?Once a session establishes a route, maintain it.  Add logic to prioritize routes by session importance.\n \nreply",
      "Then some sessions get a shitty link and others get a better link. Your bandwidth may go up for a benchmark of a lot of concurrent sessions but your latency will be random and all over the place.Doing it at the packet level in theory gives you the ability to exploit the aggregate bandwidth for any session but as OP noted you still have all the latency problems and middleboxes getting in the way.QUIC by the way solves the middlebox problem and you could put individual QUIC streams on separate connections to solve the head of line blocking that can appear but I feel like that\u2019s closer to the TCP session thing where you only benefit the use cases that set up multiple streams. HTTP3 where this does happen may not benefit though because bandwidth tends to not be a problem if your rich enough to afford multiple links in the first place (ie more latency sensitive). This could be useful in places if you build a custom end to end solution for video streaming where you put the time-sensitive parts of the video on the lowest latency link and let the rest of the video buffer across all links. It\u2019s a very niche use case though and not worth the effort I think.\n \nreply",

      "I like this. It\u2019s an opportunity for unpopular science to shed light on things we might not otherwise talk about.\nThe research on blue zones is all fraud or records error.\nDucks are rapacious little fuckers.\nThis topics are not pleasant, but they\u2019re real science. Our understanding gets advanced, errors in thinking get corrected.Science is one of the rare structure of knowledge which includes self correction by default. But correction and reputation don\u2019t play nicely together. For correction to occur somebody had to be wrong. In some cases a lot of people.Having a prize like this lets us elevate previously embarrassing findings, take the whole thing less seriously and make room for ideas outside the status quo.I\u2019m not sure this prize is any less important than the Nobel prize.\n \nreply",
      "I credit the Ig Nobels for alerting me of the \"blue zone\" myth.For people who don't know, it was about research related to communities around the world that are known to have a high number of centenarians. Lots of researchers have studied those populations to see how their genes/lifestyles are different from ordinary folks and try to take lessons from them.Then one researcher came along and showed that most/all of those communities have poor record keeping, and it's quite possible they didn't have as many centenarians as claimed. What's more, for the folks in those communities where the records are reliable, the average lifespan is actually average or even below average.One example: I think it was Okinawa - most of the records were destroyed due to heavy bombing in WW2. So we just had people's own claims of their age.\n \nreply",
      "Oh why can't anyone just ever call a spade a spade on here?The main finding was that it was Fraud.  People in these villages got addicted to free money for their long dead relatives. So instead of declaring them dead they willfully knowingly illegally buried/cremated them and happily kept cashing checks. In the form of various retirement payments and government social programs.It unveiled massive wide scale fraud.  It was not some silly innocient whoopsie story as you tell it.\n \nreply",

      "While I enjoyed 4dwm when I had a sgi, I am not convinced the desktop environment was that great, it did however have a very nice file manager, which I guess is 90% of a desktop environment, so perhaps it was pretty good after all.The best sgi ui innovation, which unfortunately I rarely see anywhere else, was the use of drop pockets, these are drag and drop targets, small squares that are uniformly styled to give the user a hint that dropping something here is useful.I was unable to find a good example with multiple pockets, but for example: when you see that blue square in the file manager, you know you can drop something there and it will try to use it as a path.https://docs.maxxinteractive.com/books/user-experience-ux/pa...\n \nreply",
      "Vaguely related, I saw an extremely nice little bit of UI on a MRI machine console the other day. When planning a sequence of scans, you drag them into a listbox. But once that listbox is \"full\" from top to bottom, it's hard to append to the end (rather than inserting between two existing scans), because you keep having to hit that tiny 1px wide target between the bottom of the box and the last entry.So someone at Bruker noticed this, and made a drop target UNDER the listbox that's labeled Drop Here to Append. It makes things SO much more pleasant.Best screenshot I could find online: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Horea-Christian/publica...\n \nreply"
