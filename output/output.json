      "Yea, this is more like vandalizing Wikipedia than spoofing or interfering with safety-critical systems. It's juvenile, but probably not crashing any planes. It'll get reverted, and then presumably the adsb exchange website will tighten up their security.reply",
      "As other commenters noted, this is almost certainly not RF spoofing, just sending bad data to an aggregator (ADS-B Exchange) over the internet.This instance of spoofing is notable for being the first that I know of that wasn't primitive vector art or text, but a raster image!In that area of Florida multiple receivers would have picked up actual ADS-B broadcasts. ADS-B aggregators do have various anti-spoofing measures, but they're not impossible to circumvent.The only case of actual RF spoofing of aircraft transponder signals that I know of was actually done by the U.S. Secret Service, which interfered with passenger jet collision alert systems (TCAS) by apparently broadcasting bogus signals near Ronald Reagan National Airport (KDCA): https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/aviation-flights-whi...reply",
      "Just because I don't often get a chance to talk about this, I'll mention that there was a malfunction/accident/bug that caused what you might call spoofed signals to go out around Long Island and New York. Really interesting case where it seems that an FAA system wasn't handling magnetic declination correctly, which led to it generating false TIS-B targets that were rotated 13 degrees from real aircraft positions, from the radar antenna point of view: https://x.com/lemonodor/status/1508505542423064578(TIS-B is a system that broadcasts ADS-B-like signals for aircraft that are being tracked by radar but either don't have ADS-B Out or otherwise might not be picked up by other aircraft with ADS-B In, e.g. maybe they're at a low altitude.)There have been a couple other incidents with the TIS-B system. E.g. this apparent test near Dallas in 2022 that generated dozens of false targets in an interesting pattern: https://x.com/lemonodor/status/1481712428932997122 There was a similar incident around LAX several months later.reply",

Or because their heirs don't have enough money? I might be missing something, but how do these two incredibly-delayed payments help them train now?

It's very common for a kid to only get access to their trust when they turn 18 with more access granted at other milestones. It also sounds like a free life insurance policy. Those also only pay out when someone dies.This doesn't sound macabre at all to me.

      "This is pretty normal for government procurement, though. and in fact, most large organisation procurement. There's a whole wall of standards that the supplier must meet, e.g. ISO9000 that your little web-dev shop almost certainly doesn't. They won't buy from a supplier that is likely to go out of business. There's a ton of other criteria that you've got to meet to get the business. If there's any, even the slightest, chance that buying from a business might one day reflect badly on the civil servant in the procurement office, then they won't buy from that business. The civil servant has nothing to lose from saying \"no\" and runs a risk if they say \"yes\".Businesses that do meet these criteria charge like wounded bulls. In part because they know that all the other businesses that the govt could turn to will also charge like wounded bulls.reply",

Say, \"Have a plan for the things you do\".Step 2: Add one additional requirement to your standard: \"Prioritize Vendors that meet this standard\".Step 3: Obscure the hell out of the standard, (to not make the grift too obvious) and stick it behind a paywall.Step 4: Franchise out the (nigh-impossible to fail) \"approval\" process to 3rd parties, who pay you for the privilege.Step 5: Your first few \"standardized\" companies put pressure on their vendors and customers to get certified, so they hire consultants, who in turn pay you, who tell them \"Good job, you meet the standard.

Meanwhile, even the open weights stuff OpenAI gave away last summer scores between the two.Why do you care about LM Arena? It has so many problems, and the fact that no one would suggest using GPT-4o for doing math or coding right now, or much of anything, should tell you that a 'win rate of 70%' does not mean whatever it looks like it means. (Does GPT-4o solve roughly as many Erdos questions as gemini-3-pro...? Can you write roughly as good poetry?)reply",
      "It'd certainly be odd if people were recommending old LLMs which score worse, even if marginally. That said, 4o is really a lot more usable than you're making it out to be.The particular benchmark in the example is fungible but you have to pick something to make a representative example. No matter which you pick someone always has a reason \"oh, it's not THAT benchmark you should look at\". The benchmarks from the charts in the post exhibit the same as described above.If someone was making new LLMs which were consistently solving Erdos problems at rapidly increasing rates then they'd be showing how it does that rather than showing how it scores the same or slightly better on benchmarks. Instead the progress is more like years since we were surprised LLMs were writing poetry to massage out an answer to one once. Maybe by the end of the year a few. The progress has definitely become very linear and relatively flat compared to roughly the initial 4o release. I'm just hoping that's a temporary thing rather than a sign it'll get even flatter.reply",
      "Frankly, this reads as a lot of words that amount to an excuse for using only LMArena, and the rationale is quite clear: it\u2019s for an unrelated argument that isn\u2019t going to ring true to people, especially an audience of programmers who just spent the last year watching the AI go from being able to make coherent file edits to multi hour work.LMArena is, de facto, a sycophancy and Markdown usage detector.Two others you can trust, off the top of my head, are LiveBench.ai and Artifical Analysis. Or even Humanity\u2019s Last Exam results. (Though, frankly, I\u2019m a bit suspicious of them. Can\u2019t put my finger on why.

Artificial Analysis at least has the same at 20% from the top, so maybe that's the one we all agree to use for now since it implies faster growth.> FWIW GPT 5.2 unofficial marketing includes the Erdos thing you say isn\u2019t happening.Certainly not, unless you're about to tell me I can pop into ChatGPT and pop out Erdos proofs regularly since #728 was massaged out with multiple prompts and external tooling a few weeks ago - which is what I was writing about. It was great, it was exciting, but it's exactly the slow growth I'm talking about.I like using LLMs, I use them regularly, and I'm hoping they continue to get better for a long time... but this is in no way the GPT 3 -> 3.5 -> 4 era of mind boggling growth of frontier models anymore. At best, people are finding out how to attach various tooling to the models to eek more out as the models themselves very slowly improve.reply",

While the\ndata distributions between phase 2 and phase 3 make direct comparison difficult, the overall effect was notable: BatchHet reduced by a factor of 4.23x, and step-to-step variance reduced by a factor of 2.4x (see Figure 1), a significant improvement when compared to the default packing strategy. We note that training runs without the RSDB exhibit much higher values in the higher-order moments of the running loss distribution, which we believe to correlate with network instability during training.\n```Page 9 of the technical report has more details, but it looks like they found some data prep methods as well as some other optimizations that overall worked out really well.

It's worth reading the whole thingTo 'steelbrain: cherry-picking one single quote out of a nuanced article does the journalism here a dire disservice.

Congratulations to Shannon and Parker on shipping this!I had to make this same decision years ago: do I focus on Ruby or do I bring Sidekiq to other languages? What I realized is that I couldn't be an expert in every language, Sidekiq.js, Sidekiq.py, etc. I decided to go a different direction and built Faktory[0] instead, which flips the architecture and provides a central server which knows how to implement the queue lifecycle internally. The language-specific clients become much simpler and can be maintained by the open source community for each language, e.g. faktory-rs[1]. The drawback is that Faktory is not focused on any one community and it's hard for me to provide idiomatic examples in a given language.It's a different direction but by focusing on a single community, you may have better outcomes, time will tell![0]: https://github.com/contribsys/faktory\n[1]: https://github.com/jonhoo/faktory-rsreply",

When Sanskrit texts get translated into a modern language, it tends to be in Hindi or Thai as a result.In English, NYU had the Clay Library but Gombrich passed away, and at Harvard, Narayana Murty (Infosys founder and Rishi Sunak's father in law) is funding the Murty Library, but both are barely scraping the top of the barrel.reply",

The idea also recalls a failed Ptolemaic attempt to punish the Jews in 3 Maccabees and in Josephus, and resonates with a longstanding association of elephants and alcohol in popular thought. Unfortunately, despite the recent rise in scholarly interest on war-elephants, this issue remains overlooked. This article reassesses the complexities of our sources and the practicalities of Hellenistic battles.

      "The strategy I see with the most success in online communities is something to the effect of, \"If it appears in the trailer, or what is very obviously the earlygame tutorial area, it's basically fair game. Otherwise use spoiler tags.\" Some puzzle games are best experienced entirely unspoiled (Outer Wilds) and others benefit from sortof a layered hints approach.Steam guides for Blue Prince are fantastic about this, and were extremely welcome to me once the RNG nature of the game stopped being exciting and started being a tedious obstacle. There's nothing quite like needing to spend several real world hours to try a puzzle solution that may be a complete waste of time, simply because the game doesn't really like to spawn the needed rooms (in an acceptable configuration) very often.reply",
      "Outer Wilds, and imperatively its DLC, are transcendent gaming experiences.Like many, I stopped playing my first time over a frustration with the jet pack and ship movement controls.I returned later, this time determined to master the movement controls only to find that after mastering them you eventually abandon perfect movement for efficiency anyways and perfect gameplay looks a lot like the initial flailings.Anytime you get 'stuck' in the game the answer is always, \"what have you tried, what can you try instead?\"  Illuminating the tendency to presuppose an answer, and grow frustrated when it fails repeatedly.It's certainly a \"just play it without looking up anything about it\" game.  I went in without being spoiled by the \"first surprise\" that is referenced in this article and was stunned when I figured it out.Swapping FPS violence for scientific and archaeological discovery, and a wholesome story centered on the social bonds of music make for a truly wonderful gaming experience.I highly recommend the game to anyone.reply",
      "Controls were great, didn't see whatever it is that people love about the story, and the game loop made me quit.reply",
      "In terms of things I'd say to encourage someone to play without spoilers, I think I'd focus on mechanics, like:1. The game has depth to its locations that shows up on repeated visits. Expect to return with better tools/information to see new things. Shortcuts will reveal themselves over time.2. There is an in-game tool that takes notes for you, hints at undiscovered content, and can provide on-screen waypoints to help you navigate.3. Don't be too worried about your (avatar's) personal safety, or about rushing. Later there may be times where both might matter for your goals, but the game is designed to support trial-and-error.reply",
      "I really should get back to outer wilds. I like you bounced off of it because of the controls, and I keep meaning to go back because people I have faith in swear by it. I know the most basic secret you learn incredibly early, but that's the only 'spoiler' I know.reply",
      "After this comment I immediately closed my eyes and stuck my fingers in my ears (and added the game to my wishlist). I appreciate the rec, it looks great.reply",
      "The \"first surprise\" is why I tell people \"Just play this game, and don't look up anything about it!\".The two games the article has pictures of games are IMO everyone who plays games should play; they are two of the best of all time.reply",
      "I guess this is the one time maybe reading the comments first saved me of a spoiler I didn't want to be exposed to, so thank you :) Guess I finally need to give it a try before it get accidentally spoiled for me.reply",

Same feel (except narratively its a bit more spoopy).  It's like a selfquel.(Also, worth noting that if you start a new game, you can just go straight to playing the DLC content without having to replay or complete the base game)reply"

      "My concurrency knowledge is a bit rusty but aren't spinlocks only supposed to be used for very brief waits like in the hundreds of cycles (or situations where you can't block... like internal o/s scheduling structures in SMP setups)? If so how much does all this back off and starvation of higher priority threads even matter? If it is longer then you should use a locking primitive (except for in those low level os structures!) where most of the things discussed are not an issue. Would love to hear the use cases where spin locks are needed in eg user space, I dont doubt they occur.reply",
      "what is/are the thread synchronization protocol called which is the equivalent to ethernet's CSMA? there's no \"carrier sensing\", but instead \"who won or mistakes were made\" sensing. or is that just considered a form of spinlock? (you're not waiting for a lock, you perform your operation then see if it worked; though you could make the operation be \"acquire lock\" in which case it's a spinlock)reply",
      "The basic rule of writing your own cross-thread datastructures like mutexes or condition variables is... don't, unless you have very good reason not to. If you're in that rare circumstance where you know the library you're using isn't viable for some reason, then the next best rule is to use your OS's version of a futex as the atomic primitive, since it's going to solve most of the pitfalls for you automatically.The only time I've manually written my own spin lock was when I had to coordinate between two different threads, one of which was running 16-bit code, so using any library was out of the question, and even relying on syscalls was sketchy because making sure the 16-bit code is in the right state to call a syscall itself is tricky. Although in this case, since I didn't need to care about things like fairness (only two threads are involved), the spinlock core ended up being simple:    \"thunk_spin:\",\n        \"xchg cx, es:[{in_rv}]\",\n        \"test cx, cx\",\n        \"jnz thunk_has_data\",\n        \"pause\",\n        \"jmp thunk_spin\",\n    \"thunk_has_data:\",reply",
      "As always: use standard libraries first, profile, then write your own if the data indicate that it's necessary. To your point, the standard library probably already uses the OS primitives under the hood, which themselves do a short userspace spin-wait and then fall back to a kernel wait queue on contention. If low latency is a priority, the latter might be unacceptable.The following is an interesting talk where the author used a custom spinlock to significantly speed up a real-time physics solver.Dennis Gustafsson \u2013 Parallelizing the physics solver \u2013 BSC 2025\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kvsvd67XUKwreply",
      "Another time when writing a quick and dirty spinlock is reasonable is inside a logging library. A logging library would normally use a full-featured mutex, but what if we want the mutex implementation to be able to log? Say the mutex can log that it is non recursive yet the same thread is acquiring it twice; or that it has detected a deadlock. The solution is to introduce a special subset of the logging library to use a spinlock.reply",

Users don't care how the code looks, they just care that the product works. Writing, on the other hand, is meant to communicate something directly from me, so it feels like there's something lost if I hand that job over to AI.I often think of this quote from Ted Chiang's excellent story The Truth Of Fact, The Truth of Feeling:> As he practiced his writing, Jijingi came to understand what Moseby had meant: writing was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it. And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking. When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements. Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn\u2019t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.\u201dBut there is obviously some kind of tension in letting an LLM write code for me but not prose - because can't the same quote apply to my code?I can't decide if there really is a difference in kind between prose and code that justifies letting the LLM write my code, or if I'm just ignoring unresolved cognitive dissonance because automating the coding part of my job is convenient.reply",

      "\"I just used it to clean up my writing\" seems to be the usual excuse when someone has generated the entire thing and copy pasted it in. No one believes it and it's blatantly obvious every time someone does this.reply",
      "Not sure what you're talking about. Quite often I've written out a block of information and have found chunks of repeats or what would be hard to interpret by other stuck here or there.

I have people I work with that if I could I would demand they take what they write and ask \"would this make sense to any other human on this planet\".There are no shortages of people being lazy with LLMs, but at the same time it is a tool with valid and useful purpose.reply",
      "Sometimes I ramble for a long time and ask an LLM to clean it up. It almost always slopifies it to shreds. Can't extract the core ideas, matches everything to the closest popular (i.e. boring to read) concept, etc.reply",

The power and flexibility of tools like Claude Code and ChatGPT have given a lot of functionality both to experienced developers and new developers alike. But there are trade-offs.The Jellyfin project has, from day one, had a major focus on code quality - readability, simplicity, conciseness. This is a mostly manual effort driven by a dedicated team of individuals, and is motivated by a desire to fix the code Jellyfin is based off of which, without beating a dead horse too much, was extremely fragile, spaghettified, and prone to over-engineered complexity.We are seeing a precipitous rise in contributors using AI within the Jellyfin ecosystem, both in the server and for clients, as well as a rise in criticism and concern about LLMs generally. At this time we are writing this policy to address exactly what we expect and desire with respect to contributions and interactions within our community th"
