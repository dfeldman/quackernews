      "Note this is oxygen assisted - the diver breathed pure oxygen and (from the article) can increase available oxygen from 450mL to 3L in doing so.Still impressive nonetheless and I didn't know that this trick is sometimes used in Hollywood to extend underwater filming time. Avatar 2 comes to mind when I was impressed to find out Sigourney Weaver trained to hold her breath for 6 and half minutes in her 70s!Coming back to the article, I'm disappointed that the details were sparse - how do they check whether the contestant is conscious?

      ">It\u2019s important to note that people were dismissive of Paris because validating her playbook would mean admitting that they were playing an inferior game. Everyone else had invested years into optimizing for the most legible version of the rules. They\u2019d look silly if they were to admit she had found a better way of doing things.I had a co-worker who was addicted to verbally correcting everyone around him, which was super irritating but he seemed just quick enough and just technically correct enough that his formula kind of worked, for him. I would come into work and he would be in a middle of an argument where he insisted some distinction that everyone else that was asinine, he felt was important, and he always got the last word. Everything from pronunciation to definitions of ordinary concepts, and it was visibly important to his self esteem how right he was about all of these things.At one point he claimed I \"didn't understand comedy\" because I enjoyed Tim and Eric. If you don't know them, think adult swim style surrealist meta-humor but in lo-fi live action. And my theory for this particular co-worker is that something about what Tim and Eric make fun of must have hit too close to home, too close to his sense of normalcy, which in this case meant seeing them not as comedic personas but as familiar targets to \"correct\", only to realize they were part of a comedic persona satirizing a certain idea of normalcy, to his initial bafflement and then resentment. Because for a moment he could make a home in that world, and it was a world they were making fun of.These are all my assumptions of course, but I think they map on to this Paris Hilton analysis, which is that for some reason he needed to see their entire way of doing comedy as not real or not legitimate, because doing so would mean something fundamental about his psychology was something that could be turned into a joke.reply",

Of course there is accounting for people being different and your goal in life shouldn't be \"never bother anybody\", but some folks take things too far.

      "The summary of what they did on the page is largely accurate. I mean, the repository on GitHub that cooks the official Docker Debian images is indeed primarily maintained by a Debian maintainer who is a member of many different Debian teams, even if it is not an official artifact of Debian. And the problem is fixed in Docker, too, but it sounds like the issue is that they'd like the old Docker images with the backdoored packages to be removed.And sure, you definitely lose some niceties of Debian when you run it under Docker. You also lose some niceties of Docker when you don't.reply",
      "This headline is so egregiously sensationalist.The XZ backdoor never made it to Debian stable. It is \"still lurking in docker images\" because Debian publishes unstable testing images, under a tag that is segregated from the stable release tags. You can find vulnerable containers for literally any vulnerability you can imagine by searching for the exact snapshot where things went wrong.And then downstream projects, if they choose to, can grab those images and create derivatives.Basing your images on an experimental testing version of Debian and then never updating it is an obvious mistake. Whether XZ is backdoored is almost irrelevant at that point, it's already rotting.> Upon discovering this issue, Binarly immediately notified the Debian maintainers and requested removal, but the affected images remain in place.It is generally considered inappropriate to remove artifacts from an immutable repository for having a vulnerability. This wasn't even done for vulnerable Log4j versions in Maven repositories, despite Log4shell being one of the most potent vulnerabilities in history. It would just break reproducible builds and make it harder to piece together evidence related to the exploit.reply",

      "Wait, I'm confused. The text here says all data remains on device and emphasises how much you can trust that, that you're obsessed with local-first software, etc. Clicking on the demo video, step one is... configuring access tokens for external services? Are the services shown at 0:21 (Groq, OpenAI, Antrophic, Google, ElevenLabs) doing the actual transcription, listening to everything I say, and is only the resulting text that they give us subject to \"it all stays on your device\"?

      "I will forever mourn the general demise of server browsers. Too many games require you to use matchmaking systems, which means it's very hard to build up a small community in-game anymore. You either have to rely on forming small parties with people you've stumbled upon one by one, or you have to seek out people from some much larger area like Reddit or Discord. It takes a lot of the serendipity out of the experience. Without a small community it becomes much harder to ensure you're not playing with people who make the game less fun by whatever metric you care about.I used to be an admin on a group of about 18 or so connected Counter-Strike 1.6 servers called T3Houston*. We ran modified versions of various Warcraft 3 mods which added persistent XP/leveling, as well as integration with an external item store and player database the owner maintained. Most of those servers were filled to the brim during peak US gaming times, and our forum was quite active.There aren't many games these days where you could do something like that. I discovered the community because one day I was just looking for a server with open slots for me to join. I was fairly skeptical of whatever a Warcraft mod would be like, but ended up enjoying it so I added it to my favorites. Eventually I got to know the regulars and joined the forum. Notably, the place felt far less toxic than the average server I'd join back then. I can completely believe this is just me looking at the past through rose tinted glasses, but it feels like the general toxicity has gotten worse at the same time as we've lost a lot of tools to manage it.* If anyone else here remembers the name T3Houston: hi! I'm Stealth Penguinreply",

      "I have so much nostalgia for that time period.Counter-strike was my introduction to how the Internet and TCP/IP worked. I built my first PC to play it. I learned linux to run servers for it. It inspired me and my friends to learn C to try and make our own mod. I made a website for my clan, self hosted it, and registered a domain for it.The community was incredible, partly because of the server browser, as you point out. There was also a massive IRC community around it that was way more cohesive than what exists today. So CS was also my on ramp to IRC and the technology communities there.I don't play a lot of games any more. Every now and then I'll try something. I have the GPU anyway and everything works great on Linux now. I found out there are third party server browsers for CS2 with modded servers. It is so tiny compared to the old days, but they exist. I played around on a couple around a year ago and had a good time. If you are feeling nostalgic, you should check it out.reply",

      "In a very loosely analogous way, this reminds me of how I think about car-centric cities.

This creates a cycle of heightening anxiety and stress while driving, and discouraging you from going anywhere, making it feel safer to just be isolated in your far-flung house, and thank god you have endless streaming content at your fingertips to make that even more palatable.Addictive media content, particularly short-form casino-style recommended content sucks time away from you in a way that's deeply meaningless. You have no time for friends or real social stimulation and you sit in bed continuing to scroll because it's easy, and you repeat the cycle until all you're doing is that and being sad and lonely, which makes you want to see people more or have a hobby, but that takes a modicum of effort and you have your phone right there.reply",

      "They show R&D is effective and R&D spending is up, and conclude obsolescence must be the reason this is not reflected in productivity pretty much by process of elimination. However there is an alternative - that for reasons unrelated to R&D, productivity is actually being driven down, and ever increasing R&D output is necessary just to maintain current levels of productivity.In particular, they are looking at US manufacturing. While this is a diverse industry, it's clear that in many subfields there is quite a bit of saturation. When everyone has a car, and cars last longer and longer, the need for new cars goes down. Once you get to a point where your industrial capacity can provide enough to satisfy demand, further R&D only reduces the costs of satisfying that demand, not increased output, and in some cases improvements to product quality may even further reduce demand. In the US, light vehicle sales peaked in 2000, and while the numbers dipped during various market downturns, they keep coming back to roughly the same asymptote. The numbers are even more striking if you break it down further - the annual demand for personal vehicles has fallen by a factor of 4 since 1965, and by a factor of 3 since 2000, the difference being made up by increased commercial vehicle demand. Looking at other industries like steel paints a similar picture.reply",
      "If the OECD is to be believed, the elephant in the room is that China negated the value of western R&D by about $500B per year since 2010.That\u2019s why being a fast follower is so valuable, you get everyone else to waste money on the wrong ways to build things. It also causes R&D to show much worse returns.reply",
      "> That\u2019s why being a fast follower is so valuable, you get everyone else to waste money on the wrong ways to build things. It also causes R&D to show much worse returns.Frankly I think this is the big cultural change in tech generally, isn't it? People come up with ideas and everyone goes \"oh I want to do that\", so they replicate it off the back of the work everyone else has done. Uncritical FOMO.But actually it's better to be an even slower follower, generally, as a survivor strategy. Apple and Nintendo shows this. It's better to go \"I see what they are all doing, and I see where they think consumers are, but I think they are wrong, and I think it's not just a question of them going about it wrong, but that all of this evidence suggests consumers actually wish they were getting this other thing, and that is what we should build\".reply",
      "This works for Apple & Nintendo because they built their brand image while being fast-followers \u2013 and even pioneers decades ago (the Apple ][ was among the trailblazers, just like the GameBoy or the (S)NES).I would bet that a company trying to replicate that strategy without the previously established brand image would not go very far.reply",
      "Apple and Nintendo have some of the strongest brand loyalty this side of macrobrewed beer and sports teams. They can afford to go against the current because they have extremely deep barrels of fanatics who will buy just about anything they make, regardless of whether it's cutting edge or not.reply",
      "Checking I understand this right: the paper\u2019s contention is that more R&D, whilst still producing productivity gains, is invalidating gains made from other R@D? e.g. everyone developing their own LLM. It\u2019s an interesting idea, but why would that be happening?reply",
      "I do not, and have never, understood why absolute R&D investment is compared to relative growth rate in this literature. It would make sense to compare R&D spending as a percentage of GDP to relative growth, or to compare absolute R&D spending to absolute per-year growth, but I remain mystified by the comparison of absolute R&D spending with relative growth.reply",

      "There's tons of backlash here as if people think better performance requires writing in assembly.But to anyone complaining, I want to know, when was the last you pulled out a profiler? When was the last time you saw anyone use a profiler?People asking for performance aren't pissed you didn't write Microsoft Word in assembly we're pissed it takes 10 seconds to open a fucking text editor.I literally timed it on my M2 Air. 8s to open and another 1s to get a blank document.

And I'm not going to bother checking because the race isn't even close.I'm (we're) not pissed that the code isn't optional, I'm pissed because it's slower than dialup. So take that Knuth quote you love about optimization and do what he actually suggested. Grab a fucking profiler, it is more important than your Big Oreply",
      "Another datapoint that supports your argument is the Grand Theft Auto Online (GTAO) thing a few months ago.[0] GTAO took 5-15 minutes to start up. Like you click the icon and 5-15 minutes later you're in the main menu. Everyone was complaining about it for years. Years. Eventually some enterprising hacker disassembled the binary and profiled it. 95% of the runtime was in `strlen()` calls. Not only was that where all the time was spent, but it was all spent `strlen()`ing the exact same ~10MB resource string. They knew exactly how large the string was because they allocated memory for it, and then read the file off the disk into that memory. Then they were tokenizing it in a loop. But their tokenization routine didn't track how big the string was, or where the end of it was, so for each token it popped off the beginning, it had to `strlen()` the entire resource file.The enterprising hacker then wrote a simple binary patch that reduced the startup time from 5-10 minutes to like 15 seconds or something.To me that's profound. It implies that not only was management not concerned about the start up time, but none of the developers of the project ever used a profiler. You could just glance at a flamegraph of it, see that it was a single enormous plateau of a function that should honestly be pretty fast, and anyone with an ounce of curiousity would be like, \".........wait a minute, that's weird.\" And then the bug would be fixed in less time than it would take to convince management that it was worth prioritizing.It disturbs me to think that this is the kind of world we live in. Where people lack such basic curiosity. The problem wasn't that optimization was hard, (optimization can be extremely hard) it was just because nobody gave a shit and nobody was even remotely curious about bad performance. They just accepted bad performance as if that's just the way the world is.[0] Oh god it was 4 years ago: https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times...reply",
      "I just started getting back into gaming and I'm seeing shit like this all the time. It's amazing that stuff like this is so common while the Quake fast inverse square root algo is so well known.How is it that these companies spend millions of dollars to develop games and yet modders are making patches in a few hours fixing bugs that never get merged. Not some indie game, but AAA rated games!I think you're right, it's on both management and the programmers. Management only knows how to rush but not what to rush. The programmers fall for the trap (afraid to push back) and never pull up a profiler. Maybe over worked and over stressed but those problems never get solved if no one speaks up and everyone is quiet and buys into the rush for rushing's sake mentality.It's amazing how many problems could be avoided by pulling up a profiler or analysis tool (like Valgrind).It's amazing how many millions of dollars are lost because no one ever used a profiler or analysis tool.I'll never understand how their love for money makes them waste so much of it.reply",

      "iirc this bug existed from release but didn't impact the game until years later after a sizable number of DLCs were added to the online mode, since the function only got slower with each one added. Not that it's fine that the bug stayed in that long, but you can see how it would be missed given that when they had actual programmers running profilers at development time it wouldn't have raised any red flags after completing in ten seconds or whatever.reply",
      "> To me that's profound. It implies that not only was management not concerned about the start up time, but none of the developers of the project ever used a profiler.Odds are that someone did notice it during profiling and filed a ticket with the relevant team to have it fixed, which was then set to low priority because implementing the latest batch of microtransactions was more important.I feel like this is just a natural consequence of the metrics-driven development  that is so prevalent in large businesses nowadays. Management has the numbers showing them how much money they make every time they add a new microtransaction, but they don't have numbers showing them how much money they're losing due to people getting tired of waiting 15 minutes for the game to load, so the latter is simply not acknowledged as a problem.reply",
