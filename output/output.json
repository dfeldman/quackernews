      "Google has been stomping around like Godzilla this week, and this is the first time I decided to link my card to their AI studio.I had seen people saying that they gave up and went to another platform because it was \"impossible to pay\". I thought this was strange, but after trying to get a working API key for the past half hour, I see what they mean.Everything is set up, I see a message that says \"You're using Paid API key [NanoBanano] as part of [NanoBanano]. All requests sent in this session will be charged.\" Go to prompt, and I get a \"permission denied\" error.There is no point in having impressive models if you make it a chore for me to -give you my money-reply",
      "First off, apologies for the bad first impression, the team is pushing super hard to make sure it is easy to access these models.- On permission issue, not sure I follow the flow that got you there, pls email me more details if you are able too and happy to debug: Lkilpatrick@google.com- On overall friction for billing: we are working on a new billing experience built right into AI Studio that will make it super easy to add a CC and go build. This will also come along with things like hard billing caps and such. The expected ETA for global rollout is January!reply",

      "Pretty funny! I wonder how much of a premium Google is paying.reply",
      "Oh man, there is so, so much pain here. Random example - if GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true in your environment, woe betide you if you're trying to use gemini cli with an API key. Error messages don't match up with actual problems, you'll be told to log in using the cli auth for google, then you'll be told your API keys have no access.. It's just a huge mess. I still don't really know if I'm using a vertex API key or a non-vertex one, and I don't want to touch anything since I somehow got things running..Anyway vai com dios, I know that there's a fundamental level of complexity deploying at google, and deploying globally, but it's just really hard compared to some competitors. Sadly, because the gemini series is excellent!reply",
      "The new releases this week baited me into business ultra subscription. Sadly it\u2019s totally useless for gemini 3 cli and now also nano banana does not work. Just wow.reply",
      "I bought a Pro subscription (or the lowest tier paid plan, whatever it's called), and the fact that I had to fill out a Google Form in order to request access to get Gemini 3 CLI is an absolute joke. I'm not even a developer, I'm a UX guy who just likes playing around with seeing how models deal with importing Figma screens and turn them into a working website.

Mission design takes years, and payload mass is the most important constraining factor.  So it'd now be fairly reasonable approach to start building now for 9x4's constraints, and then fly on it or Starship depending on readiness and price.  If customers start doing this now, that also means a quicker pickup on using the increased launch capability.On a funnier note, the 9 in Falcon 9 is the number of engines.

      "I've been paying attention to this project periodically over the past few years.  It would be nice to have a FOSS clone of macOS, similar to how FreeDOS, ReactOS, and Haiku are FOSS clones of MS-DOS, Windows, and BeOS, respectively.The only thing is that this project has been quite slow going, which is similar to the histories of FreeDOS, ReactOS, and Haiku, where it took a long time for those projects to get to a usable state.  It is a lot of work cloning an operating system, especially with an aim for binary compatibility.  The Linux kernel benefited from the fact that there was an entire GNU ecosystem of tools that can run on Unix, and even in that case, the GNU ecosystem was seven years in the making in 1991 when the first version of the Linux kernel was released.  It would've taken much longer for Linux to have been developed had GNU tools not existed.Writing an entire operating system is long, hard work, even when provided the resources of companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google.  Hopefully projects like ravynOS and the similar HelloSystem (https://hellosystem.github.io/docs/) will lead to FOSS clones of macOS eventually, even if we need to wait another 5-10 years.reply",

Much like ReactOS and WINE, ravynOS and Darling share a lot of Cocoa code.For the problem of OpenStep implementations specifically, a bespoke software stack has the benefit of being able to put Mach messaging into the kernel, where it is much more performant.They chose the FreeBSD kernel over Darwin for the sake of hardware compatibility (though of course NeXT Mach is one of the most widely-ported kernels of all time...)There is also overlap with GNUstep, helloSystem, and other projects in the broader \"open-source Mac/NeXT\" space, though ravynOS (obviously) prefers BSD/MIT/Apache-style licensing over GNU-style licensing. Nevertheless, ravynOS currently uses the GNUstep libobjc2 runtime, a bit like how most of the Unix world used to depend on gcc.reply",

      "I'm not affiliated with ravynOS, but I've been periodically following the project for a few years.The main page (https://ravynos.com/) expresses the philosophy of ravynOS:\"We love macOS, but we\u2019re not a fan of the ever-closing hardware and ecosystem. So, we are creating ravynOS \u2014 an OS aimed to provide the finesse of macOS with the freedom of FreeBSD.\"rayvnOS seems to be designed for people who love macOS, particularly its interface, its UI guidelines, and its ecosystem of applications, but who do not like the direction that Apple has moved toward under Tim Cook (soldered RAM, limited and inflexible hardware choices, notarization, iOS-influenced interface changes, increased pushiness with advertising Apple's subscription services, etc.) and who would be unhappy with either Windows or the Linux desktop.Speaking for myself, I used to daily-drive Macs from 2006 through 2021, but I now daily-drive PCs running Windows due primarily to the lack of upgradable RAM in ARM Macs.  I'm not a big fan of Windows, but I need some proprietary software packages such as Microsoft Office.  This makes switching to desktop Linux difficult.It would be awesome using what is essentially a community-driven clone of macOS, where I could continue using a Mac-like operating system without needing to worry about Apple's future directions.On the Unix side of things, I believe the decision to base ravynOS on FreeBSD rather than on Linux may make migrating from macOS to ravynOS easier, since macOS is based on a hybrid Mach/BSD kernel, and since many of the command-line tools that ship with macOS are from the BSDs.  This is known as Darwin.  It's not that a Mac clone can't be built on top of Linux, but FreeBSD is closer to Darwin than Linux is.reply",

      "Come to think of it, it just dawned on me that most of the proprietary Mac programs I\u2019ve used on Mac OS X/macOS (as opposed to the classic Mac OS) are either from Apple (Preview.app, Dictionary.app, iPhoto/Photos, iTunes/Apple Music, Keynote, iMovie, GarageBand), Microsoft (Office, Teams), or are Electron apps like Zoom and Slack.  The only non-Microsoft, non-Electron third-party proprietary applications I\u2019ve used on my Macs in the past 19 years are from the Omni Group, particularly OmniOutliner (which came bundled with my 2006 MacBook) and OmniGraffle.It seems that what I miss the most about using a Mac whenever I\u2019m on Windows or Linux is Apple\u2019s bundled apps, not necessarily third-party Mac apps since I never used them much to begin with.

But alas: the cipher was broken and the contents of the letters got her executed.These days, strong encryption software and hardware is a commodity.

      "TIL about this eerily similar DC-10 crash in 2011:Shortly after liftoff, 20 feet (6.1 m) above and 7,000 feet (2,100 m) down the runway, the No. 2 engine separated from the wing and struck the No. 1 engine's inlet cowling, causing it to produce drag and reduced thrust. Even with full right aileron and rudder, the plane started to descend and drift to the left. The captain lowered the nose and leveled the wings, which was followed by the plane making multiple contacts with the runway. After touchdown, the plane drifted left and departed the runway, crossing a taxiway before coming to rest in a saltwater marsh. A fire erupted which consumed the top of the cabin and the cockpit. All three crew members survived.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Aerial_Refueling_Service...Obviously the DC-10 is not the MD-11, but the MD-11 is a direct descendant, including the trijet configuration.reply",
      "...is this a bot comment? The accident you linked is very clearly of a Boeing 707, which has zero relation to a DC-10 and is most decidedly not a trijet.reply",
      "Originally explained on the blancolirio channel on YouTube -The timing and manner of the break make a lot more intuitive sense when you consider that the engine is essentially a massive gyroscope. As the plane starts to rotate, the spinning engine resists changes to the direction of its spin axis, putting load on the cowling. When the cowling and mount fail, that angular momentum helps fling the engine toward the fuselage.reply",

In the case of UPS flight 2976, the pylon rear bulkhead looks to be in one piece, but the mounting lugs at the top of the rear bulkhead cracked.Admiral Cloudberg has a great article on AA 191 that covers exactly what happened: https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/rain-of-fire-falling-the...reply",
      "American 191's engine mount failed because of improper maintenance. It remains to be seen whether this failure had the same cause or if it was something else, such as metal fatigue.reply",
      "A failure due to metal fatigue would still be a failure to properly maintain the aircraft, right? I know by \"improper maintenance,\" you're referring to actual improper things being done during maintenance, and not simply a lack of maintenance. But I'm reading things like \"the next check would've occurred at X miles,\" and, well... it seems like the schedule for that might need to be adjusted, since this happened.reply",
      "Yes, when I said \"improper\" I meant the American 191 maintenance crew took shortcuts. The manual basically said \"When removing the engine, first remove the engine from the pylon, then remove the pylon from the wing. When reattaching, do those things in reverse order.\" But the crew (more likely their management) wanted to save time so they just removed the pylon while the engine was still attached to it. They used a forklift to reattach the engine/pylon assembly and its lack of precision damaged the wing.[0]Fatigue cracking would be a maintenance issue too but that's more like passive negligence while the 191 situation was actively disregarding the manual to cut corners. The crew chief of the 191 maintenance incident died by suicide before he could testify.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_191#E...reply"

      "There's a reason for most regulations - most of them are written in blood.Now sure, you may be the one \"good corporation\" out there, who will do things the right way and (edit: not) sell a cheap product or mislead anyone. But if the regulations aren't super stringent, others will undercut you by skimping on safety/emissions and selling a similar product for way less.It becomes too tempting to cheat otherwise - see Dieselgate / VW, for example. Make it possible to easily profit by cheating (via relaxed regulations) and people will. Again, not you specifically (maybe), but people in general.Since we can't tell what kind of person you are, REALLY - SBF also told people to trust him, for example - onerous regulations are required.Plus, I love how on the main page advertising to companies, Revoy advertises 3x-to-5x better fuel efficiency - I'm guessing this one is the one they'll need to back up and officially achieve or companies will dump them / sue.In the blog post, he claims 94% less fuel and 7 mpg to 120 mpg. I don't see how 7 mpg to 120 mpg is \"only\" 3x-5x better fuel efficiency - it seems like it's more 17x. Sounds to me like he's exaggerating the effect in the blog to try to get sympathy.reply",
      "> But if the regulations aren't super stringent, others will undercut you by skimping on safety/emissions and selling a similar product for way less.Yup.  For example: this is why the US automakers have shoved all the Brodozers down everybody's throats; it let them duck efficiency requirements.reply",
      "> As one example, one state agency has asked Revoy to do certified engine testing to prove that the Revoy doesn\u2019t increase emissions of semi trucks. And that Revoy must do this certification across every single truck engine family. It costs $100,000 per certification and there are more than 270 engine families for the 9 engines that our initial partners use. That\u2019s $27,000,000 for this one regulatory item. And keep in mind that this is to certify that a device\u2014whose sole reason for existence is to cut pollution by >90%, and which has demonstrably done so across nearly 100,000 miles of testing and operations\u2014is not increasing the emissions of the truck. It\u2019s a complete waste of money for everyone.Wild - whoever did this should lose their job.reply",

      "Its not usually one person, but many well meaning committees.reply",
      "The problem isn\u2019t that regulations exist. The problem is that they are defined in a way that reasonable work arounds or alternative pathways do not exist for situations like this. 270 engine families for 9 engine suggests that the designs may be small variations that would not significantly change the emissions between them. The bureaucrats should waive off some requirements here.The other alternative that I can think of is that experimental engines get an exception to be not certified for X miles of operation. Once the candidates are chosen for mass production, mandatory certifications can be introduced. Even if your new design doubles the emissions for some reason, over 100000 miles, that\u2019s barely a drop in the bucket. For reference, double the emissions for 100000 miles is roughly equivalent to having an extra semi on the road for a year, which is nothing.reply",
      "We need more information. How does this work for internal combustion truck engines?Is the regulation well intentioned poorly designed? Is it anti-competitive gatekeeping drafted by lobbyists? Is the author misrepresenting something? All of the above? Hard to say.reply",
      "You cannot separate the idea of regulation from their harm because they are inherent to the concept. A system so complex and dynamical as human civilization is beyond our ability to correctly ascertain the outcome of interventions, especially those imposed from the top down. In other words, we're likely to do more harm than good by imposing interventions because we cannot accurately predict their outcomes. Which is why they often have paradoxical effects. Rent control is a fantastic if trivial example of such.We know central planning doesn't work, yet we are inclined to do it anyway under the false notion that it's better to do something rather than nothing.reply",

There were no graphics, no joystick, and no soundtrack, only words on a screen and the player\u2019s curiosity. Yet those words built worlds more vivid than most games of their time. What made that possible wasn\u2019t just clever writing, it was clever engineering.Beneath that world of words was something quietly revolutionary: the Z-Machine, a custom-built engine. Z-Machine is a specification of a virtual machine, and now there are many Z-Machine interpreters that we used today that are software implementations of that VM. The original mainframe version of Zork was too large for early home computers to handle, so the team at Infocom made a practical choice. They split it into three games titled Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III, all powered by the same underlying system. This also meant that instead of"

It would be a shame to spend a huge premium on a server board and settle for slower older tech CPUs only to have all of those slots sit empty.It\u2019s a good idea to add up the PCIe devices you will use and the actual bandwidth they need. You lose very little by running a GPU in a PCIe x8 slot instead of a full x16 slot, for example. A 10G Ethernet card only needs 1 lane of PCIe 4.0.

It really doesn't matter where the data is stored if the indexing / embedding is happening on your infrastructure.Enterprises with compliance requirements are quite likely the types of clients looking for ways to save time searching through petabytes of data.reply",
      "I think the phrase is apt, actually, but it's not perfect:1. We have an embedded agent that can read, edit, organize, and take actions on your files. This means it can read almost any media type, which is why it's \"cursor for files\" even though \"isn't _cursor_, cursor for files?\". In other words, Cursor is \"Poly for text\" :)2. We provide you with an \"IDE\", I.e. a file browser. However, unlike Cursor we actually built our engine rather than relying on an existing open source one like VS CodeLastly, agree about the enterprise solution. All in due time for sure!reply",
      "\u201cCursor\u201d is a developer product. A non-dev is less likely to know Cursor-the-product or understand what it is, and will more likely think of a mouse cursor or a text cursor. So even disregarding whether the analogy makes sense, this is a strange slogan for a file browser that presumably is targeted at regular computer users. \u201cChatGPT for files\u201d would make more sense.reply",
      "Part of the issue with the \"slogan\" is Cursor/XYZ jank IDE is already \"for files\". \n\"Cursor for data\" seems slightly better in my opinion. You are clearly using \"Cursor\" as something to draw familiarity to, But I suspect the bulk of your future target market probably doesn't know what \"Cursor\" is.reply",
      "Agreed. We chose it for the Hacker News crowd.reply",
      "Thanks for sharing this.I am curious to know if your agent can connect to a user\u2019s custom MCP server in order to make tool/calls with files attached.  For example I have a custom MCP server that catalogs the images which are submitted in the RPS 2.0 payload.  I have a python wrapper script that convert\u2019s Cursor\u2019s stdio MCP interface to an http request, inserting htaccess credentials and scanning the tool call args for any files that it needs to attach to the payload. This lets me set up the wrapper script as an MCP server in the cursor settings. This lets the built in Auto-mode agents do some similar kinds of tasks like you are describing.With that said, it sounds like your system has better agents and tools for working with things besides just text files, so I am wondering if perhaps your agentic tools might be a good fit for a situation where for example I have a messy filesystem full of images that may already be duplicates in the database.  If I provide the MCP tools into my database, can your system and agents use tools that I define?  Does your system have ability to attach access credentials if/when making calls to third party mcp/tools?reply",
      "Huh! Very cool. We do want to integrate MCP servers for sure. There are some amazing use cases \u2014 downloading and organizing email attachments, importing or exporting from other services, using citations/references. And because we have a desktop app we could support local MCP as well. But nothing immediate as far as timeline on our end.reply",
      "This is really cool! I suck at organizing my filesystem and I've lost track of how many times I had to find _that ONE_ PDF which I KNOW I have but cannot find! This would have solved that many times over.However, at least for my use-case, this is a very infrequent problem. So, a monthly subscription and the security risk wouldn't be worth it. Though I'm certain there are people who work with files all day and for them, this might be god-send!reply",
      "I used the original Google Desktop app a long time ago and even though I didn\u2019t need to use it often it did become my de facto way of opening/locating files (I was really bummed when they killed it).reply",
      "Agree. One thing that we see our users doing more of is \"NotebookLM style tasks\" where they just drop in a bunch of files or ask the agent to download stuff and then start using the agent to do things. Summarize, create notes, answer questions, etc. We believe that an increasing amount of work with \"files\" will be stuff like this, and having a file system that can search all your files to do these things seemed useful enough for us to build!reply"
