      "If this had been available in 2010, Redis scripting would have been JavaScript and not Lua. Lua was chosen based on the implementation requirements, not on the language ones... (small, fast, ANSI-C). I appreciate certain ideas in Lua, and people love it, but I was never able to like Lua, because it departs from a more Algol-like syntax and semantics without good reasons, for my taste. This creates friction for newcomers. I love friction when it opens new useful ideas and abstractions that are worth it, if you learn SmallTalk or FORTH and for some time you are lost, it's part of how the languages are different. But I think for Lua this is not true enough: it feels like it departs from what people know without good reasons.reply",
      "I don't love a good deal of Lua's syntax, but I do think the authors had good reasons for their choices and have generally explained them. Even if you disagree, I think \"without good reasons\" is overly dismissive.Personally though, I think the distinctive choices are a boon. You are never confused about what language you are writing because Lua code is so obviously Lua. There is value in this. Once you have written enough Lua, your mind easily switches in and out of Lua mode. Javascript, on the other hand, is filled with poor semantic decisions which for me, cancel out any benefits from syntactic familiarity.More importantly, Lua has a crucial feature that Javascript lacks: tail call optimization. There are programs that I can easily write in Lua, in spite of its syntactic verbosity, that I cannot write in Javascript because of this limitation. Perhaps this particular JS implementation has tco, but I doubt it reading the release notes.I have learned as much from Lua as I have Forth (SmallTalk doesn't interest me) and my programming skill has increased significantly since I switched to it as my primary language. Lua is the only lightweight language that I am aware of with TCO. In my programs, I have banned the use of loops. This is a liberation that is not possible in JS or even c, where TCO cannot be relied upon.In particular, Lua is an exceptional language for writing compilers. Compilers are inherently recursive and thus languages lacking TCO are a poor fit (even if people have been valiantly forcing that square peg through a round hole for all this time).Having said all that, perhaps as a scripting language for Redis, JS is a better fit. For me though Lua is clearly better than JS on many different dimensions and I don't appreciate the needless denigration of Lua, especially from someone as influential as you.reply",
      "> For me though Lua is clearly better than JS on many different dimensions and I don't appreciate the needless denigration of Lua, especially from someone as influential as you.Is it needless?  It's useful specifically because he is someone influential, and someone might say \"Lua was antirez's choice when making redis, and I trust and respect his engineering, so I'm going to keep Lua as a top contender for use in my project because of that\" and him being clear on his choices and reasoning is useful in that respect.  In any case where you think he has a responsibility to be careful what he says because of that influence, that can also be used in this case as a reason he should definitely explain his thoughts on it then and now.reply",
      "> Lua has a crucial feature that Javascript lacks: tail call optimization.I'm not familiar with Lua, but I expect tco to be a feature of the compiler, not of the language. Am I wrong?reply",
      "You\u2019re wrong in the way in which many people are wrong when they hear about a thing called \u201ctail-call optimization\u201d, which is why some people have been trying to get away from the term in favour of \u201cproper tail calls\u201d or something similar, at least as far as R5RS[1]:> A Scheme implementation is properly tail-recursive if it supports an unbounded number of active tail calls.The issue here is that, in every language that has a detailed enough specification, there is some provision saying that a program that makes an unbounded number of nested calls at runtime is not legal. \u201cProper tail calls\u201d or \u201cTCO\u201d or whatever is the statement that tail calls do not ever count as nested, which expands the set of legal programs. That\u2019s a language feature, not (merely) a compiler feature.[1] https://standards.scheme.org/corrected-r5rs/r5rs-Z-H-6.html#...reply",
      "I don't think you're wrong per se. This is a \"correct\" way of thinking of the situation, but it's not the only correct way and it's arguably not the most useful.A more useful way to understand the situation is that a language's major implementations are more important than the language itself. If the spec of the language says something, but nobody implements it, you can't write code against the spec. And on the flip side, if the major implementations of a language implement a feature that's not in the spec, you can write code that uses that feature.A minor historical example of this was Python dictionaries. Maybe a decade ago, the Python spec didn't specify that dictionary keys would be retrieved in insertion order, so in theory, implementations of the Python language could do something like:  >>> abc = {}\n  >>> abc['a'] = 1\n  >>> abc['b'] = 2\n  >>> abc['c'] = 3\n  >>> abc.keys()\n  dict_keys(['c', 'a', 'b'])\n\nBut the CPython implementation did return all the keys in insertion order, and very few people were using anything other than the CPython implementation, so some codebases started depending on the keys being returned in insertion order without even knowing that they were depending on it. You could say that they weren't writing Python, but that seems a bit pedantic to me.In any case, Python later standardized that as a feature, so now the ambiguity is solved.It's all very tricky though, because for example, I wrote some code a decade that used GCC's compare-and-swap extensions, and at least at that time, it didn't compile on Clang. I think you'd have a stronger argument there that I wasn't writing C--not because what I wrote wasn't standard C, but because the code I wrote didn't compile on the most commonly used C compiler. The better approach to communication in this case, I think, is to simply use phrases that communicate what you're doing: instead of saying \"C\", say \"ANSI C\", \"GCC C\", \"Portable C\", etc.--phrases that communicate what implementations of the language you're supporting. Saying you're writing \"C\" isn't wrong, it's just not communicating a very important detail: what implementations of the compiler can compile your code. I'm much more interested in effectively communicating what compilers can compile a piece of code than pedantically gatekeeping what's C and what's not.reply",
      "If the language spec requires TCO, I think you can reasonably call it part of the language.reply",
      ">Lua is the only lightweight language that I am aware of with TCO.Scheme is pretty lightweight.reply",
      "Formally JavaScript is specified as having TCO as of ES6, although for unfortunate and painful reasons this is spec fiction - Safari implements it, but Firefox and Chrome do not. Neither did QuickJS last I checked and I don't think this does either.reply",
      "> as my primary languageI'd love to hear more how it is, the state of the library ecosystem, language evolution (wasn't there a new major version recently?), pros/cons, reasons to use it compared to other languages.About tail-calls, in other languages I've found sometimes a conversion of recursive algorithm to a flat iterative loop with stack/queue to be effective. But it can be a pain, less elegant or intuitive than TCO.reply"

      "Cool to see this here. It\u2019s funny because we do so many huge, complex, multiyear  projects at Free Law Project, but this is the most viral any of our work has ever gone!Anyway, I made X-ray to analyze the millions of documents we have in CourtListener so that we can try to educate people about the issue.The analysis was fun. We used S3 batch jobs to analyze millions of documents in a matter of minutes, but we haven\u2019t done the hard part of looking at the results and reporting them out. One day.reply",

      "No, we worked with researchers that developed that kind of system, but didn't broadcast our work b/c the research was too sensitive. Seems the cat is out the bag now though.I think the combination of AI and font-metrics is going to be wild though. You ought to be able to make a system that can figure out likely words based on the unredacted ones and the redaction's size. I haven't seen any redaction system yet that protects against this.reply",
      "I thought glyph spacing attacks are an old idea; like I recall reading about such ideas 10-20 years ago unless I\u2019m misremembering. Can you clarify why it was considered \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d if the whole point of this effort is to showcase these attacks?reply",
      "> I haven't seen any redaction system yet that protects against this.The linked article suggests widening redacted areas more than needed with some randomization applied to the width. Strikes me that that wouldn't do much except add a few more possible solutions.reply",
      "Yeah, the more robust protection is to widen to a constant. But in the general case that could require reflowing the pdf. But honestly single word redactions are really probably useless with cheap AI that can highly accurately fill in the gapsreply",
      "Depends what you're trying to hide.If the redaction is a person's name, and there's nothing else to give the person's identity away, single word redaction probably works reasonably well, AI or no AI.reply",
      "I haven't gone through more than just 10% of the files released today, but noticed that at least EFTA00037069.pdf for example has a `/Prev` pointer, meaning the previous revision of the file is available inside of the PDF itself. In this case, the difference is minor (stuff moved around), but I'm guessing if it's in one file, it could be more. You can run `qpdf --show-object=trailer EFTA00037069.pdf` on a PDF file to see for yourself if it's there.I'm almost fully convinced that someone did this bad intentionally, together with the bad redactions, as surely people tasked with redacting a bunch of files receive some instructions on what to do/not to do?reply",
      "Explain like I\u2019m stupid: what is the most gracious interpretation of redaction when releasing files like this?Why should anyone involved retain any anonymity?I\u2019m asking in good faith because naively it seems like this should not even exist.

      "For those curious about the \"consistent principle of law\" here - SCOTUS wrestled with nearly exactly this question in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton earlier this year, and effectively emboldened more of these laws.Previously the Fifth Circuit had relied heavily on Ginsberg v. New York (1968) to justify rational basis review. But Ginsberg was a narrow scope - it held that minors don't have the same First Amendment rights as adults to access \"obscene as to minors\" material. It wasn't about burdens on adults at all. Later precedent (Ashcroft, Sable, Reno, Playboy) consistently applied strict scrutiny when laws burdened adults' access to protected speech, even when aimed at protecting minors.In Paxton the majority split the difference and applied intermediate scrutiny - a lower bar than strict - claiming the burden on adults is merely \"incidental.\" Kagan had a dissent worth reading, arguing this departs from precedent even if the majority won't frame it that way. You could call it \"overturning\" or \"distinguishing\" depending on how charitable you're feeling.The oral arguments are worth watching if you want to understand how to grapple with these questions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckoCJthJEqQOn 1A: The core concern isn't that age-gating exists - it's that mandatory identification to access legal speech creates chilling effects and surveillance risks that don't exist when you flash an ID at a liquor store.Note: IANAL but do enjoy reading many SC transcriptsreply",

      "> When the network is bad, you get... fewer JPEGs. That\u2019s it. The ones that arrive are perfect.This would make sense... if they were using UDP, but they are using TCP. All the JPEGs they send will get there eventually (unless the connection drops). JPEG does not fix your buffering and congestion control problems. What presumably happened here is the way they implemented their JPEG screenshots, they have some mechanism that minimizes the number of frames that are in-flight. This is not some inherent property of JPEG though.> And the size! A 70% quality JPEG of a 1080p desktop is like 100-150KB. A single H.264 keyframe is 200-500KB. We\u2019re sending LESS data per frame AND getting better reliability.h.264 has better coding efficiency than JPEG. For a given target size, you should be able to get better quality from an h.264 IDR frame than a JPEG. There is no fixed size to an IDR frame.Ultimately, the problem here is a lack of bandwidth estimation (apart from the sort of binary \"good network\"/\"cafe mode\" thing they ultimately implemented). To be fair, this is difficult to do and being stuck with TCP makes it a bit more difficult. Still, you can do an initial bandwidth probe and then look for increasing transmission latency as a sign that the network is congested. Back off your bitrate (and if needed reduce frame rate to maintain sufficient quality) until transmission latency starts to decrease again.WebRTC will do this for you if you can use it, which actually suggests a different solution to this problem: use websockets for dumb corporate network firewall rules and just use WebRTC everything elsereply",

They basically implemented a primitive form of rate control by only allowing a single frame to be in flight at once. It was easier for them to do that using JPEG because they (to their own admission) seem to have limited control over their encode pipeline.reply",
      "> have limited control over their encode pipeline.Frustratingly this seems common in many video encoding technologies.     The code is opaque, often has special kernel, GPU and hardware interfaces which are often closed source, and by the time you get to the user API (native or browser) it seems all knobs have been abstracted away and simple things like choosing which frame to use as a keyframe are impossible to do.I had what I thought was a simple usecase for a video codec - I needed to encode two 30 frame videos as small as possible, and I knew the first 15 frames were common between the videos so I wouldn't need to encode that twice.I couldn't find a single video codec which could do that without extensive internal surgery to save all internal state after the 15th frame.reply",

Each GOP can be concatenated with another GOP with the same properties (resolution, format, etc) as if they were independent streams. So there is actually a way to do this. This is how video splitting and joining without re encoding works, at GOP boundary.reply",
      "In my case, bandwidth really mattered, so I wanted all one GOP.Ended up making a bunch of patches o libx264 to do it, but the compute cost of all the encoding on CPU is crazy high.

      "> I couldn't find a single video codec which could do that without extensive internal surgery to save all internal state after the 15th frame.fork()? :-)But most software, video codec or not, simply isn't written to serialize its state at arbitrary points. Why would it?reply",

That's what the save button is for, and it's functional at any point in the document writing process!In fact, nearly everything in computing is serializable - or if it isn't, there is some other project with a similar purpose which is.However this is not the case with video codecs - but this is just one of many examples of where the video codec landscape is limiting.Another for example is that on the internet lots of videos have a 'poster frame' - often the first frame of the video.    That frame for nearly all usecases ends up downloaded twice - once as a jpeg, and again inside the video content.

The same is possible to varying extents on smart TVs that use Android TV as their OS.You can even completely replace Google's sponsored-content-feed launcher/homescreen with an open source alternative that is just a grid of big tiles for your installed apps (FLauncher).For me, SmartTube with both ad-blocking and sponsor block is the killer feature of Android TV as a platform.If you're into local network media streaming, Jellyfin's Android TV app is also great. Their Apple TV app is limited enough that people recommend using a paid third party client instead. And that's usually inevitably the case with Apple's walled gardens...
