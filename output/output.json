It makes clear some obvious potentials of LLMs in spreadsheets. They can basically be an advanced autofill. If you\u2019ve used CoPilot in VSCode, you understand the satisfaction of feeling like an LLM is thinking one step ahead of you. This should be achievable in spreadsheets as well.[0] https://youtube.com/watch?v=0SVilfbn-HY&t=1251 (queued to demo at 20:51)\n \nreply",

Didn't get \"satisfaction\"; instead felt deeply irritated by the \"backseat driver\". Maybe it works better if you're just churning out mediocre boilerplate.\n \nreply",
      "Seems like a reasonably-cromulent use-case -- or at least, it fits in with my own uses of LLMs.I suck at spreadsheets.  I know they can do both useful and amazing things, but my daily life does not revolve around spreadsheets and I simply do not understand most of the syntax and operations required to make even fairly basic things work.  It requires a lot of time and effort for me to get simple things done with a spreadsheet on the rare occasion that I need to manipulate one.There are things in life that I am very good at; spreadsheets are simply not amongst them.But do I know what I want, and I generally even have a ballpark idea of what the results should look like, and how to calculate it by hand [horror].  I just don't always know how to articulate it in a way that LibreOffice or Google Sheets or whatever can understand.LLMs have helped to bridge that gap for me, but it's a pain in the ass:  I have to be very careful with the context that I give the LLM (because garbage in is garbage out).But in the demo, the LLM has the context already.  This skips a ton of preamble setup steps to get the LLM ready to provide potentially-useful work, and moves closer to just making a request and getting the desired output.Having one unified interface saves even more steps.(And no, this isn't for everyone.)\n \nreply",

      "Aside: bisecting flakes doesn't have to involve repeated runs. You can reformulate bisection as an information probing operation, expanding the scope to support noisy benchmarks or low-probability flakes. Bayesian inference narrows down the probable range of the failure for each new observation, and you can choose new probes to maximize information gain-- or even run them in parallel to minimize the total time.You do have to provide flake rate probability to do the probability estimates, but even roughly correct rates work fine. Running bisects assuming a 5% chance of getting a false positive or negative barely adds more steps and greatly improves robustness.The math is pretty simple too-- my old prototype might still be in Google's monorepo; I should reimplement it for the open source world.\n \nreply",

      "What an excellent speaker. Despite many moral issues with his character, I am a big admirer of Jobs in a professional capacity.I have found that audiences genuinely appreciate when you speak powerfully and simply; you can rephrase something like> \"we're considering many different possible pathways, and some of them we're finding are less optimized to meet our institutional goals\"to> \"we're not sure what to do, and so far most of the ideas we thought of were pretty bad\"and your audience laughs and leans in. I try to emulate that Jobs-ian style at work and a lot of people seem to like my presentations.I think people really like it when someone takes the responsibility of standing up and saying \"let's not overcomplicate this, I'll take responsibility for making the decisions and I don't spend a lot of time trying to hide my real level of knowledge. In fact, I may know less than some of you.\" (Even if that's probably not true.)Another good (albeit hyperbolic) example of this is Jeremy Irons' speech near the end of Margin Call (2011) where he tells the junior analyst to \"speak to me as if I am a very small child, or possibly a golden retriever.\" In fact, that's also an explicit direction given to flight controllers at NASA during their training.\n \nreply",

We live a lot of our lives with objects.I too have qualms about the practical Steve Jobs but he saw that the world was being built of out computer and it could be nice or it could be terrible.

So I think density is really a red herring.But they also mention mass transfer (\"positioning of the red, green and blue chips to form a full-colour pixel\") which plausibly is a much bigger effect: If you replace a process that needs to delicately interweave 3 distinct parts with one that lays down a grid of identical (but individually controllable) parts, you potentially get a much bigger manufacturing efficiency improvement that could go way beyond 3x.

I know a quick search from someone from out of town is kind of shaky and there's a lot of local knowledge you have, but are houses like https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/4411-Gladstone-St-Pittsbu... at $170k or https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1404-Marlboro-Ave-Pittsbu... at $154k or https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/107-Lilac-Ave-Pittsburgh-... at $160k not good enough for you or something? Zillow shows hundreds and hundreds of decent looking houses under $200k within Pittsburgh city limits.These are incredibly affordable even on a 5 figure household income. You are very lucky to live in a place with such a reasonable CoL. I've known people to move there from eastern PA for the sake of that.If I'm missing something, I'd love to hear it, but I'm pretty sure what I'm gonna hear is that you're filtering out a lot of  the affordable stuff due to some interesting self imposed restrictions.\n \nreply",

      "\"Game theory optimal\" (as poker players like to call it) is not really the optimal strategy. It's the nash equilibrium strategy assuming the other players are also playing a nash equilibrium strategy. As soon as one player deviates from the nash equilibrium it's not optimal anymore :).It's interesting how this affects play. If a player is bluffing slightly less than they should be, the adjustment is drastic, you should actually never call with hands that do not beat their value hands. If they are bluffing optimally, you are supposed to call using what is known as \"minimum defense frequency\". What's interesting about this is the minimum defense frequency is based on what the strongest hands you can possibly have in that situation are and the opponents possible hands do not even factor into it. It's required to prevent your opponent from bluffing with any two cards profitably.To do the math, if you are on the river and the opponent bets 100 into 100, for this to be profitable for them they need to win 50% of the time or more. If your opponent is bluffing optimally, you need to call with 50% of the strongest hands you have in that specific situation (if you don't know what hands you have in a specific situation that's a problem) and sometimes they can be dogshit like King high.But, very important to note, very few players actually bluff enough and if they bluff less than they should you should only ever call when your hand actually beats their range of possible value hands. (value vs bluff is kind of a difficult thing to communicate, generally it's value if you want your opponent to call)Most players don't bluff enough as a result of most players calling too much! When they call too much you should obviously not bluff! This leads to very boring games of poker.\n \nreply",

It's the nash equilibrium strategy assuming the other players are also playing a nash equilibrium strategy. As soon as one player deviates from the nash equilibrium it's not optimal anymore :).This is not really what most people mean when they say \u201coptimal strategy\u201d. It\u2019s true that exploitative play will make more money if you know exactly what your opponent is doing and if they keep doing it despite it not working. Neither of these will generally hold in an actual game.The reason it\u2019s called \u201coptimal strategy\u201d is because it works no matter what your opponent is doing. It will not make as much as a strategy tailored perfectly to your opponent but it will never lose to anyone under any circumstances, assuming infinite games (assuming infinite games just so we can ignore variance). The worse case the strategy has is break even to anyone else using it.\n \nreply",
      ">  What's interesting about this is the minimum defense frequency is based on what the strongest hands you can possibly have in that situation are and the opponents possible hands do not even factor into it.This is actually not quite true. MDF is purely a formula based on pot size and the bet size (pot size / pot size + bet size). The fact that it doesn't consider various ranges is why it's not really useful - it was a simplified formula used to try to understand the game before solvers existed.There are situations where your opponent can bet any two cards profitably and you do have to fold - imagine they bet the size of the pot, but have the better hand 99% of the time, you're simply forced to let them bluff the 1% of the time they're bluffing. MDF is a pre-solver concept and not an especially useful concept in the modern game.\n \nreply",
      "I'm pretty sure mdf applies to rivers when you are last to act. I'd be interested in being proven wrong however if you have solver output that shows it. I remember studying solver output and seeing it in action.I know that before the river there are range advantages that make defending mdf a losing play.\n \nreply",
      "What's true is that equilibrium strategies typically converge to solutions where the better makes the caller indifferent between calling and folding. In the toy example I've given where the betters range is so strong, the caller should always fold, the better now has an incentive to add more bluffs to the range to take advantage of the folds. Then the caller will want to call more. This might converge to the MDF which might be what you're suggesting, assuming we started with ranges that could have enough bluffs given the runouts.If you open up the solver, and give one player only Ace-Ace as their starting range, and the other player a pair of twos, and the board Ace-Ace-Three-Three-Three, then the pair of twos will fold 100% on river and will not call at MDF.\n \nreply",
      "You are absolutely right! Haha damn back to the drawing board\n \nreply",
      "In the narrow range of poker variants (all heads up, ie only two players, not full ring like all but the last few hands of the Main Event) where it's meaningful to talk about a truly optimal game, any theoretical optimal play will still take money from all humans it's just slower (but with zero risk) compared to exploitative play.In live cash games, speed matters, you want to take all the available chips before the fish realise they're out-matched, but to protect yourself the optimal play, if you could memorise it, would be safer because it can't be exploited yet it does take the opponent's chips.Poker players are gamblers. So \"safer\" isn't really what they were going for anyway.\n \nreply",
      "More important than speed is variance. If you really crush your opponents you are less at risk of busting from bad bankroll management.\n \nreply",

The game is Texas Hold\u2019em. Only two of you remain, and no community (face-up) cards have been dealt yet. Things rarely get simpler than this in poker, and you have a binary decision to make: call (match your opponent\u2019s bet) or fold (give up). To a professional player, though, every detail demands consideration. What was the betting pattern before the all-in push? Who acted first? How many chips does each player have, and how many are in the pot? When will the blinds, or forced bets, increase? And of course, how likely are sixes to win the hand?
