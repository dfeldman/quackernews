      "For those worried about tiny COPs from these gizmos, trawling through the actual paper -- as well as the PR from JHU APL -- in this HN post [1] shows claims of COPs of ~15 for Delta Ts of 1.3\u00b0C.A compressor based cooler gets a COP of about 4 in the real world. I'm pretty sure this is an apples to oranges comparison to an expert (I am not one of those) but a factor of 3+ increase in COP is fairly noteworthy -- if it holds up.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44424087reply",
      "ugh, reading the paper, their methodology is kinda crap. They basically just guess what the thermal resistances in their system are, and use air temperature measurements to figure out the heat flow. This is not how to measure heat flow accurately. It might be OK as a comparison with whatever TEC they tested with, maybe, but it's not at all something I would trust to compare to another test setup. If their box is more insulative than they think it is, their results are gonna look better than reality. This can be validated at least approximately by just putting a heater in the box that's dissipating a known amount of heat and looking at the temperature rise, but it seems they didn't even do this. And in general the regime where you've got small temperature differences is where your systematic error in a system like this can become huge and distort the results by multiples.(This is an area which is really hard and details matter. Heat is basically impossible to measure directly, and the indirect measurements are fraught with peril. Getting it wrong was a large part of why people thought they had demonstrated cold fusion)reply",

      "COP has to be compared at the same delta T. The COP of a loss less refrigerator is infinite at Delta T = 0And you dont get to stack Peltiers to increase COP, only to increase delta T.Still, Peltiers are super cool and I have some ideas for their use od they get slightly better. Advances are super welcome.reply",

      "The idea was just so astonishing that I ordered some from American Science and Surplus. I connected the leads to a battery and poof, one side got hot and the other got cold. Blew my mind.I didn't actually have a use for it. It was just neat that it actually worked.I understand the basic physics of it perfectly well. It's just one of those things where you expect basic physics to be overwhelmed by friction or something.reply",
      "What about a \u0394T of say 20\u00b0C? I'd reckon most refrigerators and air conditioners are around there (temp difference of refrigerant between evaporator and condenser).Stacking a bunch of these Peltiers  to give more temperature difference would give a pretty low CoP. Say, for a 13\u00b0C temperature difference you'd have to stack 10 of them and use 10x the power. It's even worse actually as the hotter ones have to also pump the waste heat from the cooler ones.reply",
      "Note that a small temperature difference that is sustained very consistently over a long time using a tiny amount of electricity (let's say half of what the parent post cited, so like a COP of 8) could add up to a lot of nearly-free cooling. You'd chill your walls for weeks and when a heat wave comes with hot nights for a week, if you(r home automation) close(s) the blinds during the heat of the day, the more-powerful AC might barely have to do anythingJust an idea of course, but I'd not write new tech off as \"ok but just 1.3 degrees who cares\" when the claimed COP is so insanely good without first trying it outreply",
      "The \u0394T between evaporator (typically 2-6\u00b0C while cooling) and condenser (often 40-50\u00b0C in cooling mode) is much higher than 20\u00b0C.

      "For whatever reason, evolution decided those wavelengths should be overlapping. For example, M cones are most sensitive to 535 nm light, while L cones are most sensitive to 560 nm light. But M cones are still stimulated quite a lot by 560 nm light\u2014around 80% of maximum.The reason is simple: genes coding the long wave opsins (light-sensitive proteins) in these cones have diverged from copies of the same original gene. The evolution of this is very interesting.Mammals in general have only two types of cones: presumably they lost full color vision in the age of dinosaurs since they were primarily small nocturnal animals or lived in habitats with very limited light (subterranean, piles of leaves, etc.) Primates are the notable exception, and have evolved the third type of cone, enabling trichromatic color vision, as a result of their fruitarian specialization and co-evolution with the tropical fruit trees (same as birds, actually).So, what's interesting is that New World and Old World primates evolved this cone independently. In Old World primates the third cone resulted from a gene duplication event on the X chromosome, giving rise to two distinct (but pretty similar) opsin genes, with sensitivity peaks at very close wavelengths. As a note, because these genes sit on the X chromosome, colorblindness (defects in one or both of these genes) is much more likely to happen in males.New World primates have a single polymorphic opsin gene on the X chromosome, with different alleles coding for different sensitivities. So, only some (heterozygous) females in these species typically have full trichromatic vision, while males and the unlucky homozygous females remain dichromatic.Decent wikipedia article on the subject: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_color_vision_in_p...Types of opsins in vertebrates:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrate_visual_opsinreply",
      "This is only tangentially related, but I have always wondered why chlorophyll absorbs blue and red, but reflects green--green being sunlight's brightest component.It's almost as if there was some evolutionary pressure towards being very visible in sunlight which is more important than evolving ways to collect as much sun energy as possible. When I guess at this I end up with something along the lines of reflected green being used as a signal to a neighboring plant: \"I'm already here, grow in some other direction instead.\"  There is some evidence that plants do this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_shyness, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-3040.ep1160...) but it's not clear that the need to do so is so strong that it would overshadow the drive to collect as much energy as possible.Or perhaps there's something to do with the physics of absorbing light to drive a chemical reaction that makes it better to absorb at red and blue while passing on green (450nm and 680nm are not harmonics--so if this is the case it's more complex than which sorts of standing waves would fit in some chemical gap or other).reply",

      "It still doesn't explain the need to reflect green, though. They could have evolved to be black and absorb all energy.reply",
      "Here's a recent take: https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-are-plants-green-to-reduc...TLDR: Plants are running an energy-harvesting system that can only respond so quickly to changes in light input. Making use of green would cause variance to be large enough that the gains would not offset the losses. So, avoid green and have lower variance --> higher energy capture on average.reply",
      "Red is nature's warning signal, and blue was already taken by the sky, so the only option left was green.Just kidding of course, it is an interesting question.reply",
      "This is a good biological explanation. The physical explanation is, if the sensitivities didn't overlap, our spectral sensitivity would not be continuous.

      "> Gemini 2.5 PRO | Claude Opus 4Whether it's vibe coding, agentic coding, or copy pasting from the web interface to your editor, it's still sad to see the normalization of private (i.e., paid) LLM models. I like the progress that LLMs introduce and I see them as a powerful tool, but I cannot understand how programmers (whether complete nobodies or popular figures) dont mind adding a strong dependency on a third party in order to keep programming. Programming used to be (and still is, to a large extent) an activity that can be done with open and free tools. I am afraid that in a few years, that will no longer be possible (as in most programmers will be so tied to a paid LLM, that not using them would be like not using an IDE or vim nowadays), since everyone is using private LLMs. The excuse \"but you earn six figures, what' $200/month to you?\" doesn't really capture the issue here.reply",
      "The models I can run locally aren't as good yet, and are way more expensive to operate.Once it becomes economical to run a Claude 4 class model locally you'll see a lot more people doing that.The closest you can get right now might be Kimi K2 on a pair of 512GB Mac Studios, at a cost of about $20,000.reply",
      "> Once it becomes economical to run a Claude 4 class model locally you'll see a lot more people doing that.By that time Claude 5 (or whatever) will be available over API.I am grateful for upward pressure from models with published binaries - I do believe this is fundamental floor-raising technology.Choosing frontier-1 for the sake of privacy, autonomy, etc will always be a hard sell and only ever to a pretty niche market.

      "Have you considered the Framework Desktop setup they mentioned in their announcement blog post[0]? Just marketing fluff, or is there any merit to it?> The top-end Ryzen AI Max+ 395 configuration with 128GB of memory starts at just $1999 USD. This is excellent for gaming, but it is a truly wild value proposition for AI workloads. Local AI inference has been heavily restricted to date by the limited memory capacity and high prices of consumer and workstation graphics cards. With Framework Desktop, you can run giant, capable models like Llama 3.3 70B Q6 at real-time conversational speed right on your desk. With USB4 and 5Gbit Ethernet networking, you can connect multiple systems or Mainboards to run even larger models like the full DeepSeek R1 671B.I'm futsing around with setups, but adding up the specs would give 384GB of VRAM and 512GB total memory, at a cost of about $10,000-$12,000. This is all highly dubious napkin math, and I hope to see more experimentation in this space.There's of course the moving target of cloud costs and performance, so analysing break-even time is even more precarious. So if this sort of setup would work, its cost-effectiveness is a mystery to me.[0] https://frame.work/be/en/blog/introducing-the-framework-desk...reply",
      "Strix Halo does not run a 70B Q6 dense model at real-time conversational speed - it has a real-world MBW of about 210 GB/s. A 40GB Q4 will clock just over 5 tok/s. A Q6 would be slower.It will run some big MoEs at a decent speed (eg, Llama 4 Scout 109B-A17B Q4 at almost 20 tok/s). The other issue is its prefill - only about 200 tok/s due to having only very under-optimized RDNA3 GEMMs. From my testing, you usually have to trade off pp for tg.If you are willing to spend $10K for hardware, I'd say you are much better off w/ EPYC and 12-24 channels of DDR5, and a couple fast GPUS for shared experts and TFLOPS. But, unless you are doing all-night batch processing, that $10K is probably better spent on paying per token or even renting GPUs (especially when you take into account power).Of course, there may be other reasons you'd want to inference locally (privacy, etc).reply",
      "Yeah it's only really viable for chat use cases, coding is the most demanding in terms of generation speed, to keep the workflow usable it needs to spit out corrections in seconds, not minutes.I use local LLMs as much as possible myself, but coding is the only use case where I still entirely defer to Claude, GPT, etc. because you need both max speed and bleeding edge model intelligence for anything close to acceptable results. When Qwen-3-Coder lands + having it on runpod might be a low end viable alternative, but likely still a major waste of time when you actually need to get something done properly.reply",
      "The framework desktop isn't really that compelling for work with LLMs, it's memory bandwidth is very low compared to GPUs and Apple Silicon Max/Ultra chips - you'd really notice how slow LLMs are on it to the point of frustration.

For \"I'm lazy and want to provide minimal prompting for you to build a tool similar to what is in this software package already\", paid LLMs are king.If anything, I think the best approach for free LLMs would be to run using rented GPU capacity. I feel bad knowing that I have a 4070ti super that sits idle for 95% of the time. I'd rather share an a1000 with bunch of folks and have that run at close to max utilization.reply",

      "> So let\u2019s ask ourselves: would AI have told us this?Why ask ourselves, when we can ask the AI? Here's the start of my conversation with Gemini:> Me: What is known about fatty acid combustion in the brain?> Gemini: The Brain's Surprising Use of Fat for Fuel\nFor a long time, the brain was thought to rely almost exclusively on glucose for its immense energy needs. However, a growing body of research reveals that fatty acid combustion, or beta-oxidation, plays a more significant and complex role in brain energy metabolism and overall neurological health than previously understood. While not the brain's primary fuel source under normal conditions, the breakdown of fatty acids is crucial for various functions, particularly within specialized brain cells and under specific physiological states....It cites a variety of articles going back at least to the 1990s.So> would AI have told us this?Yes and it didreply",

      "My read of this was that AI is fundamentally limited by the lack of access to the new empirical data that drove this discovery; that it couldn't have been inferred from the existing corpus of knowledge.reply",

      "I'm in the midst of modernizing a 1994 K&R C 32-bit codebase to 64-bit C23, as a museum piece: the computer algebra system Macaulay that I coauthored, since replaced by Macaulay 2.The horror!On macOS my environment is Sublime Text as editor, iTerm as terminal. I open two full screen iTerm windows of four panes each, start Claude Code Opus 4 and type \"just task\" in each pane. CLAUDE.md tells the session to run this justfile command and follow the directions, which generally include instructions to continue by doing \"just task\" again. Each session may edit its <file>.c and <file>.h but not shared headers; if it has a problem with this I touch STOP in the task directory, the other sessions eventually are told to wait, and then the trouble child session can edit what it wants.I'm sure in a few years AI will read and fix my 57 C file code base all at once, but for now this workflow has proved invaluable.The irony? This is the dumbest parallel task manager imaginable yet it works. And our code base has a similar feel: The storage management is a set of fixed sized stacks that outperformed malloc() by 4x back in the day. Etc. Etc.I learned this gift from my Dad. He devised the Bayer filter for digital photography back in 1974, it looks like ten minutes work (it wasn't) but we're still using it.reply",
      "I was really excited to try this but this does NOT work the way I expected. I wanted a simple git worktree manager for my existing, already-checked-out repository. Instead, it requests Github permissions and clones the repo from Github. This is bad, because you need to run all the dependency installs, etc. for every workspace before being able to test anything. In other words it's like Codex or Cursor Background Agents, except worse, because it's on your machine. The reason I don't use Codex or Background Agents is because my project has way too many dependencies and would take way too long (and too complicated) to install everything required to have an isolated running instance, plus there would be DNS conflicts, external API conflicts, among other issues.What I do want is simple git worktree management for an already-checked-out repo on my machine, no Github permissions or dependency re-installation (copying node_modules, etc.).reply",

      "\"This is bad, because you need to run all the dependency installs\", you must be using Python or one of the other locally cached dependency language tookings. Is never understood why people wanto clone everything every time. Maven and its sibling use ~/.m2 so everything gets cached once. I ceinge every time I have to re-download the universe when I inevitably have to delete my venv and redo anything, what a waste of time and bandwidth and space.reply",
      "How do you suggest simultaneous independent branches be worked on concurrently from a single repository copy, or is it that you would simply prefer the local work tree method of duplication? And, for example, how do you suggest the same node_modules be used if part of the task requires changing, removing, or updating dependencies? Additionally, how much time do you expect a developer to spend implementing this new system your suggesting across all platforms for the benefit of it taking you a bit less time, especially when pulling dependencies from a local caches as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing?

      "I tried out git worktrees recently and while they do what's on the tin, I really didn't like them as much as I thought I would. I actually like the way cursor does it despite the fact that it is a VM - I wish I could have their same UI/UX but with local worktrees.reply",
      "Yes I had a similar experience. the thing that tripped me up with git worktrees, which is maybe obvious in retrospect, is that they don\u2019t include things that are not tracked by git - e.g. .env.development.localSo starting a new worktree requires additional setup and isn\u2019t as simple as just checking out a new branchreply",
      "Sorry about that! We\u2019re working on making this more intuitive.Internally our workflow looks like this: \n- we have a script that sets up a repo \u2014 copies env variables, runs pnpm i, inits a db, etc\n- we have a field in the repo settings called \u201csetup script.\u201d every time you make a new workspace, that script runsHopefully will be much improved over the next week or two!reply",

      "I personally know how this works in Europe & UK. Not only government, this applies to big companies such as large banks as well. They recruit two kinds of staff. One that works to progress some work and one who puts an many hurdles as possible and call it risk management, compliance, security, regulatory etc (RCSR). They hire approximately 3 times more people into these RCSR positions compared to the technical and real work related positions. These RCSR guys dump thousands of pages of guidelines, making it impossible for any meaningful work to progress. My technical team has been running around for 4 months for approvals for testing an upgrade of a database.Top management can never go against the RCSR guys, who are like priests of the church in medieval ages. And the RCSR guys have no goals linked to the progress of the real work. The don't like any thing that moves. It's a risk.Management thinks that RCSR helps with controls around the work. But what happens is, you put more people in building controls, they deliver fort walls around your garbage bins.reply",
      "It's also interesting how much worse security gets with all this RCSR oversight.Because the policy teams don't understand the technical details, they get hung up on things that don't matter so all your \"security budget\" (in terms of dev effort available for improvement) gets spent on useless things.Because there is a CIS guideline recommending \"do not put secrets in environment variables\" in k8s, a team I work with recently spent two weeks modifying deployments of all their third party charts to mount all secrets as volumes, this included modifying / patching upstream helm charts. This will be a maintenance burden forever lol. Actual security benefit in context is approximately zero.Meanwhile they COULD have spent that time implementing broadly effective things like NetworkPolicy or CSP for the front-end but now there is no dev time for that.At the top levels of their process there are plenty of risk x impact matrices but there aren't corresponding effort / payoff assessments, so the things being done end up not being engineering.reply",
      "> This will be a maintenance burden forever lol.Not if they never ever ship an update.(i - briefly - worked for place that did things this way. They didn't update the chart, but they _did_ use `sed` to update the image tag from time to time.)reply",
      "America has a similar (if less severe) version of this problem where nobody can contradict any compliance-adjacent function. Because if you get sued, someone will ask you \"why did you ignore the guidance of your compliance team??\" and might even try to use that to justify piercing the corporate veil. Of course compliance types have no incentive to let business happen just like business types have a limited incentive to operate in a compliant fashion, but lawsuits favor compliance always taking precedent with a hyper-cautious approach.reply",
      "And yet uber and Airbnb and polymarket and\u2026reply",
      "These are at some level businesses that do well because they avoid regulatory regimes. That risk is built-in from day one and basically their raison d'etre. I happen to think that's fine and good, but it's still the case.In other words, the guys who actually believe in a normal level of compliance are hamstrung, defection is rewarded, classic failure mode of this kind of thing.reply",
      "IOW, America also has a stagnant, risk-averse business culture, except that superimposed on this culture there's a thin, fragile, layer of risk taking, one geography- and sector-constrained, but in which ~all US value creation and economic differentiation happens.It's like how the growth of a tree trunk happens in a thin layer beneath the bark and the rest is inert wood.reply",
      "This is not limited to Europe. I worked for a company like this in the US. The problem of course is the incentive structure: The penalty for violating some minor regulation was that the company would cease to exist (or so management assumed) while there was effectively no penalty for not getting the mission accomplished.Thus the only reasonable course of action was to do nothing.reply",
      "> My technical team has been running around for 4 months for approvals for testing an upgrade of a database.Jeez, and I was just grumbling how it takes up to 24 hours for a change I make to appear in prod,\ncompared to about 4 hours at my previous job.It should be possible to develop automated systems and processes to keep most changes on the \u201chappy path\u201d where approvals are quick. These sorts of organization responses were a new layer of people who can say \u201cno\u201d grow whenever a problem happens or a regulation changes are suffocating.reply",
      "Sounds like the rest of the world couldn't be bothered with learning code, but couldn't tolerate code being law, that they tried to dilute the code's stake by adding more laws, despite code still being the law.reply"
