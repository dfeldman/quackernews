During the development of Civilization VII, Firaxis Games reached out to Ben Barnes, chief of the Shawnee Tribe, to discuss the possibility of incorporating Shawnee history into the game. By chance, Chief Barnes is a longtime fan of strategy games, including the Civilization series, and these conversations eventually blossomed into an ongoing relationship of shared knowledge and resources which not only led to more accurate and meaningful in-game depictions, but also real gains in preserving Shawnee language and culture for future generations.In 2021, the team at Firaxis began working with the Tribe to make sure the in-game Shawnee civilization* and the visionary leader Tecumseh*\u2014who is included in Civ VII's expansive roster of playable leaders, voiced by Shawnee actor Dillon Dean\u2014were respectfully represented.

      "Very interesting. I wonder if this a result of some \"swiss cheese\" effect due to constraints around UEFI and NVRAM themselves, when updating EFI variables.NVRAM must maintain atomicity of memory transactions for power failures. Its whole purpose is to store data when you turn your computer off. As a result, when deleteing an EFI variable, you can't manage the individual bytes - you have to delete a whole entry (which can be rather large - based on the EFI specification and the code used for edk2, e.g. https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/83a86f465ccb1a792f5c5...). Deleting these entries might become a problem when you start running against memory constraints and what slots in memory are actually available; hence a possible fragmentation issue.Additionally, I appreciated how short and specific this blog post was. I enjoy this style of post of someone encountering a problem and solving it.\n \nreply",
      "I imagine it's not fragmentation in the strictest sense. It's more than likely it's just the result of a bug. Perhaps garbage collection wasn't being triggered and space wasn't getting freed up. It could be that the author caused the problem themselves by how they were managing their nvram.\n \nreply",
      "There's also the fact that an NVRAM variable is never overwritten inplace; the new value is written elsewhere, and the pointer is updated to use the address of the new value. This is probably mainly for wear-leveling, but I guess it could also introduce fragmentation?Just an observation from when I was debugging a board that selfdestructed when booting a particular efi-file so I had to dig into the flash contents to figure out why, but I think this particular code was straight from tianocore.\n \nreply",
      "True, I was trying to find the variable storage requirements in the UEFI specification but couldn't (is it Section 3? 8?), so I resorted to linking to the struct definition in the EFI shell package that the author used.\n \nreply",
      "I believe it was in the mid-2000s that BIOSes started storing configuration data in the same SPI flash they occupied, and UEFI just continued that trend and expanded on it. That removing the CMOS battery no longer clears it automatically is both a good and bad thing, and another problem it's created is that flash has a limited number of write cycles - and every time the system is booted, and possibly even while running, writes occur.\n \nreply",

Frisian and Luxembourgish are interesting as \"in-between\" languages (Luxemburgish has a lot of French influence, Frisian is closer related to English).

      "I'll be honest my experiences with themes for Linux have been quite poor. Even with good ones it works for some apps but not others and you end up spending all your time fixing edge cases or just dealing with some windows not looking right.My solution has been to just use the default Ubuntu theme that ships with Gnome. I find that theme just seems to work the best across most of my apps with a few small exceptions, compare this to other themes I've tried where only like half of the windows look right.I'm sure there are better themes out there and I could achieve perfect consistency if I dug deep enough and tweaked enough things. But at least in my case I already spend many hours on my computer coding and something like desktop theming is super low on my list, it's one of those things I just need to work because I don't have time to be focusing on that crap.The same goes for my desktop environment. I am well aware that Gnome is not the best and if I put it enough effort I could have a dream setup with XFCE or one of the many tiling window managers. But for me it just goes back to not having time, the thing I love about Gnome is that even though it may be more of a resource hog, it just f*king works.\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019ve not actually built any themes so take these thoughts with a grain of salt, but my impression is that with GTK at least, most of the problems come down to CSS conflicts and libadwaita doing its own thing separate from GTK proper. It seems like a lot of GTK apps hardcode colors, fonts, etc instead of parameterizing too, which means they aren\u2019t going to respond to theme changes correctly. All together these combine to produce a pretty spotty theming experience.Things seem a bit better on the Qt side of things, but it suffers resolution scaling issues. Most KDE/Qt themes I\u2019ve tried can\u2019t draw correctly at non-integer scales.Personally I think that CSS is actually pretty badly suited for the use case of desktop UI toolkit theming.

      "I think it made substantially more sense in the 1990s.For one, Gtk+ used to be advertised as a multi platform toolkit, with a port of GDK to Win32. Making Gtk+ widgets look like Win32 made sense for that.Secondly, there were two groups of people using Linux and X11 in that era: one group who were exiles from commercial Unix, and another, faster growing group coming from Windows. For the former group, it was reasonable to want widgets to look more like Motif or Athena. The latter group wanted a more modern look, which could depart from old school Unix workstations.\n \nreply",

Nowadays, you could probably write a slightly customised Adwaita app for Windows and you'd get by more satisfactorily than if you wrote a plain GTK app and tried to theme it to modern Win32.\n \nreply",

      "A point not mentioned by the article: the electrons in a metal at room temperature are already moving very quickly due to their thermal energy (at the order of 100km/s) \u2014 much faster than the speeds quoted in the article, which is what's called the \"drift velocity\".This thermal motion is essentially random, and the electrons constantly scatter off the nuclei every which way, so it cancels out and doesn't create a net current.So, it's less than the electrons gently move under the influence of an electric field, and more that it introduced a slight bias in the existing thermal motion.E: To clarify in case it may have been unclear, this is unrelated to the speed of propagation of the electric field, which as the article says is the speed of light.\n \nreply",
      "It probably should be noted that the reason the drift velocity is so much lower than velocity due to thermal motion is that electrons cannot move very far before they collide with an atom which changes their direction.The mean distance they move in a copper wire between collisions is about 0.00000004 meters.

      "Nice writeup. FWIW, I never saw Michael Abrash wear a tie. :)We were very into 3D cards back then. We had a lot of ties to that part of the world. I had been doing video drivers for OS/2 and NT. I got to know Abrash from his writing on the VGA, 8514, and, of course, asm. At Valve, we hired a couple of great guys from 3dfx. I still have a 3dfx hat somewhere that I bust out on special occasions. The killer setup back then was hooking up two 3dfx cards (SLI). But I usually played on a standard card because I wanted/needed to see it run like most people would experience it.We had a deal with one of the companies, maybe 3dfx, but I forget who, to include the first three levels of HL with their card. Even though the game wasn't anywhere near finished, we sent off a disk to the company with our first three finished levels so we could get paid. Somehow, it leaked. We were pissed at first, but then it took off. People loved it. It really gave us the confidence that we were on the right track. It was our first game. The validation was just what we needed.Fun times.\n \nreply",

But it was the first time I could play the game without it being sluggish and looking like crap. We had bought a family PC 4 years earlier, which had cost a fortune  - but by 1998/1999 it was woefully outdated. Also, a thought: Imagine purchasing a PC today for $5k, and it being unusable for games in 3-4 years.One thing I (in general) miss from those days, was how easy it was to get into modding. Whether that be to make your own maps, or more involved game mods. The modding community really was something, and kept the game somewhat fresh for years. I also vividly remember downloading all the new iterations of counter-strike, which really took off - until settling on 1.6On a side not, it's a bit tough to think that all this was 25 years ago now, but I still remember all this quite well - having only been a teenager back then, and in 25 years I'll be this old man.

      "> On a side note, it's a bit tough to think that all this was 25 years ago now, but I still remember all this quite wellI also remember it like it was yesterday when, after school on a hot summer's day, a friend showed me this \"cool new mod\" he recently downloaded for Half-Life. It was an early version of Counterstrike. It took him an entire night to download the mod, and it only ran on his machine with a 320x240 resolution. It looked like crap and was basically unplayable. 6 months and a hardware upgrade later, we all played it for hours each day, and often non-stop for 12 hours on LAN parties. I also remember that you could contact the internet provider (Telekom) by mail, and after a few weeks they would activate something called \"Fast-Track\" for your connection, which would drop the latency from around 110ms to only 35ms, a huge advantage for MP games... it really blows my mind that all of this was 25 years ago.In the early 2000s, CS was arguably better known than the original HL.

Dynamic typing became a burden, and once the key people moved on, they struggled to hire developers who wanted to write Clojure.Also, JVM juju shooed many away. After I left, a coworker told me they had started rewriting part of it in Go, and that was going alright. Now, their stack mostly consists of Python for LLM stuff and Go for the main backend.

We've seen lots of regressions around faxed or scanned documents where the text boxes may be slightly rotated (e.g. https://www.cad-notes.com/autocad-tip-rotate-multiple-texts-...) not to mention handwriting and poorly scanned docs. Then there's contextually dependent information like X-axis labels that are implicit from a legend somewhere, so its not clear even with the bounding boxes what the numbers refer to. This is where VLMs really shine: they can extract text then use similar examples from the page to map them into their output values when the bounding box doesn't provide this for free.\n \nreply",
      "That's a great point about the limitations of traditional OCR with rotated or poorly scanned documents. I agree that VLMs really shine when it comes to understanding context and extracting information beyond just the text itself. It's pretty cool how they can map implicit relationships, like those X-axis labels you mentioned.\n \nreply",

It's been an increasingly hot topic, especially with models like Gemini 2.0 becoming cost competitive with traditional OCR.To answer this, we run a benchmark evaluating OCR accuracy between traditional OCR providers and Vision Language Models. This is run with a wide variety of real world documents. Including all the complex, messy, low quality scans you might expect to see in the wild.The evaluation dataset and methodologies are entirely Open Source. You can run the benchmark yourself using the benchmark repository on Github. You can also view the raw data from the benchmark in the Hugging Face repository. The following results evaluate the top VLMs and OCR providers on 1,000 documents. We measure accuracy, cost, and latency for each provider.We evaluated two categories of OCR providers: Traditional OCR and Multimodal Language Models.Traditional OCR providers (Azure, AWS Textract, Goo"

It represents, in my opinion, the epitome of the ingenuity, beauty and superb design of DOS games.Ultima games were designed in a unique way.  Garriott would build an RPG world, filling it with merchants, monsters and dungeons\u2026but no characters or plot.  That would only come after the world had been fully created.And the worlds he created were as real as he could make them.

      "I've been using Authy for TOTP in conjunction with Bitwarden Premium for passwords.I considered using Bitwarden Premium for TOTP, but dislike having passwords and TOTP codes in a single-point-of-failure backup location.I looked into Bitwarden Authenticator, but it didn't seem to support sync between devices, as you've now corroborated.  This is the reason I gave up on Google Authenticator and switched to Authy \u2014 I don't want to have to deal with trying to get all my accounts unlocked if my phone gets lost, broken, or stolen.I've set up Authy with a backup password so that I can recover it if necessary.  I understand that this is less secure, and Twilio (the company behind Authy) seems to have a mixed reputation.  However my reasoning is that maintaining two layers which are separate (Authy on phone and tablet, Bitwarden on laptop) is consistent with defense-in-depth theory \u2014 even if the layers have some weaknesses.Maybe it's time to switch to Yubikey, because TOTP apps that don't sync between devices are too high of a risk for losing access, and TOTP apps that sync aren't quite \"something you have\".  How do people prepare for the potential loss of Yubikeys?  Is it reasonable to get a spare[1] and keep it in a safety deposit box?[1] https://www.yubico.com/products/spare/\n \nreply",
      "Just beware of the lock-in with Authy because they make it impossible to export your TOTP secrets for \"security\" reasons. There was a method to do it by running some code but they patched up those API endpoints recently.\n \nreply",
      "*sigh*I've done another round of research into Authy and I see what you mean.  I was aware that some people don't like Authy because they object in principle to multi-device sync altogether, which I understand but am not willing to live with; I also knew that Twilio had been hacked before.  But I hadn't thought so much about the lock-in and the elevated risk for getting locked out if Twilio goes kaput.So, features that I want in a TOTP app:* Backup to cloud.  If all my devices are lost/destroyed at the same time, I want recovery to be possible using information I store offsite.* Backups not stored to my own iCloud or Google Drive, which are frequently accessed from my own devices.* Export of codes possible from the installed app so that if the vendor goes away I can migrate.* Not published by Bitwarden.  I'm happy with Bitwarden, but I would prefer that the vendor I use for TOTP be distinct from my password manager vendor.\n \nreply"
