      "The charging smarts are always in the phone, and always have been.  Just because a USB port has 15 or 30 or a gazillion Watts available doesn't mean that the phone is required to consume that much.  Similarly, the wall outlets in your house may be able to supply a couple of thousand Watts -- but that doesn't mean that a device plugged in is required to use all of that.And batteries can charge pretty fast these days.  Modern pocket supercomputers keep track of battery temperature to keep things within defined limits during charging.AFAIK the real problem, longevity-wise, for these batteries in normal use is the time spent at extremes of charge (<20% or >80%, ish).That all said:  Sure, some phones have options.My Samsung phone does some man-behind-the-curtain tricks to attempt to make it reach 100% just before it predicts that I'll unplug it (eg, when I wake up).  The idea is to maximize the charge on the phone while also keeping it at 100% SoC for as little time as practical.  This probably works great for people with regular schedules (which is to say: people who are not like me).This phone also lets me explicitly disable various fast-charge modes.  I think there's at least two different modes that I can turn off (but I leave them all turned on).And there's also a mode that limits the maximum charge to 85%, to promote long-term battery health.  I have this mode engage automatically when using wireless charging, which is something I only do with the wireless charging cradle on my car's dashboard.  (I do want the phone to be powered while I drive, but I don't normally need anything to work extra-hard to cram that last 15% into the battery when I'm on a long drive.  It's a good balance, for me.)reply",
      "I use USB-A ports on a dumb charger, but most likely, it'd be best for the battery to use a charger with PPS support (programmable power supply - the device can request finely tuned voltages, reducing losses and thus heat inside the device).reply",
      "You could convert from USB-C to USB-A and back. MicroUSB adapters are popular to chain for devices that only charge on USB-A. There are also adapters just force legacy USB charging for same problem devices. Then your phone will only charge at 12W.reply"

A program launched with one activity, and could start others with a FORK call.  There were locks, with hardware support for an atomic Test and Set instruction. Activities had priorities, and there was a good scheduler. Threads exited with an EXIT call, and when the last thread exited, so did the program. No main thread. There were timed waits, explicit waits for an event, and even async I/O with callbacks. Multiprocessors were supported. In 1966.It's still in use, as OS/2200.

      "I love seeing a change ringing article on HN, especially with well labelled diagrams!The move to a framework system where we can all ring what we like and just describe it within an agreed upon nomenclature is a great improvement rather than the legacy Decisions. Having strict rules always seemed quite dated to me - the ringing police after all do not show up if you ring a \"banned\" performance. But agreeing on names makes communication possible - a good role for a central body.Jump changes are fun too, but I don't think I agree with the article that allowing them has really led to a revolution. The top performances on BellBoard are of commonly rung non-jump methods. In fact I don't think I've seen a jump method be featured at all. Philip himself doesn't seemed to have published a performance of \"Jump\" anything since 2013. For many I think it remains an interesting novelty.reply",
      "The other reason jump changes are not a revolution and have remained just a curiosity is physics, something that's ignored by the article.For non-ringers, in change ringing the bells rotate 360 degrees each time they strike, from mouth up to mouth up. The clapper hits the bell when the it has rotated roughly 270 degrees from mouth up and is more or less horizontal, approximately 2 seconds after it starts moving. The bells are usually in the 100kg to 1000kg range (for US folks, that's 220lb to 2200lb), although they can be up to 4000kg. The only point when the ringer can exert control on the bell via the rope is when it is near the balance and mouth upwards, and speeding it up or slowing it down any more than one \"beat\" is physically very difficult on heavier bells, particularly if you are doing it for a full peal, which usually takes 3+ hours.About the least important thing in the 2022 rules changes (https://framework.cccbr.org.uk/version2) was the allowing of jump changes.p.s. there's a split-screen video showing the ringer and the bell he's ringing here: https://youtu.be/qrdLP15Xsuk?t=67reply",

If you've got a womb and are in a reasonable age range this almost certainly means you're pregnant, if not it's a sign something went badly wrong. So, testing whether this marker is present means you know months earlier than you might otherwise.Presumably the frog \"Make eggs now\" marker is different, but not different enough to ensure this effect doesn't happen, after all ordinarily frogs wouldn't be exposed to the urine of pregnant humans.> Will Welsh clawed frogs be the next species that we thought were gone but had just become better hidden?This isn't a rare species. It just wasn't in Wales and now it once again isn't in Wales. So that's like how Wales also does not have kangaroos.

      "The comments here are awful. What happened to \u201cHacker\u201d news?This is a Linux phone that actually works, running Debian. It has a battery that competes with the runtime of any modern phone. It has a snappy UI and can reliably make calls. Already it\u2019s the best Linux phone in the world, just on that basis.They\u2019re selling it for the same price as the outgoing model despite tons of bullshit tariffs being levied against them. What an achievement!I want a Linux phone that works, and I want to support a world where Linux phones exist and are financially viable to make, therefore I will buy this as my next phone.reply",
      "My biggest question is if they use Halium/libhybrys at all, something that is hard to figure out from the marketing but their GitHub repos does have hybris-related stuff. That makes it a non-Linux device to me. Hybris breaks a lot of linux stuff that should just work like flatpak, something I found out incredibly quickly when using SailfishOS.I don't think depending on Android drivers and having to run a small android just to access said hardware makes it a \"linux phone\". Especially when the linux experience is compromised because of it.postmarketOS has no hybris and everything works great, but no device has all the drivers (in fact, no device at all is reported as having a fully functioning camera, let alone everything else) so there isn't a \"flagship\" device.If I were to overspend on a linux device I want it to actually run Linux, not a handicapped version of it.And even then, why stop at the OS? Why is this overpriced \"linux\" phone not boast having user-friendly and sustainable things like a replaceable battery (probably because it doesn't?). People in this niche don't want just a Linux phone, they want a phone that respects them.reply",
      "> My biggest question is if they use Halium/libhybrys at all,That would be a showstopper for now, IMHO.  Doing it with maintainable open source Linux drivers is the hard part of having a viable device, from everything I've seen.Another concern are that I can't find who the developers are, nor even definitively what country they're based in.  (I don't see it on their About Us page, ~~and the GitHub repo contributors are hidden.~~  I saw a reference to Sydney, but unclear.)  (Edit: my mistake regarding GitHub contributors; they aren't hidden)Also, it would be nice to have the option of a better hardware provenance than a generic whitebox(?) phone from some unidentified manufacturer in China.  Even for individual hobbyist users, and certainly for corporate ones.  (This is why I'd like hardware options combinations like Purism for the premium device, and a cheaper device that runs the same software but is still from a brand that at least has a reputation to preserve, like Pine64 or (ha) Google.)reply",

I\u2019ve preordered the FLX1s. The FLX1, which is no longer in production, had a replaceable battery, but lack of a replaceable battery or non-pure Linux in an alternative phone certainly isn\u2019t going to keep me chained to Apple or Google.reply",

      "I worked in the networking group for a cloud computing company.  You've heard of them.  We didn't charge for (some) DNS traffic, so some customers figured out how to use DNS as a transport mechanism to skirt around paying data transfer fees.  It would essentially be a DoS attack which affected EVERY customer, so a few could save tiny fractions of their overall spend.  A peer team of mine had to deal with the mess.  That team had > 100% annual staff turnover, because they just made the oncall staff deal with the problem every time it showed up rather than ever solve the core issue of having a DoS vector masquerading as a feature.reply",

Within a TXT record\nthere are multiple character-strings (RFC 1035 section\n3.3.14) and\nthose are limited in length (because a single byte is used for their length),\nhowever there can be many of them.The actual limit is limited by the size of the DNS\npayload, which for UDP is these\ndays around 1232\nbytes.\nThat is obviously quite low. However if we use TCP, which doesn't require\nanything special, other than the normal fallback to TCP that DNS does, then we\ncan serve up to 64KB.I set out to demonstrate exactly that, by using Google Public DNS's JSON\nAPI and then\nserving large TXT responses over TCP, from a custom server.This mostly just works, the main issue is not with the length, but with binary\ndata, because JSON isn't really designed to handle binary data. Therefore there\nis some slightly custom JSON parsing. Using raw binary data in a TXT record\navoids the overhead of Base64 or another encoding"

      "Without running a preprocessor on the .mc file, and without adding \"%d\" support to `ShowError`, here's one other category of solution.
