(This sends out a separate email for each patch in the series, but in such a way that the messages get threaded to appear as a single conversation thread in modern email clients.)And on the maintainer side:5. `s ~/patches/patch-foo.mbox` (i.e. a command in a CLI email client like mutt(1), in the context of the patch-series thread, to save the thread to an .mbox file)6. `git am -3 --scissors ~/patches/patch-foo.mbox` to split the patch-series mbox file back into individual patches, convert them back into an annotated commit-series, and build that into a topic branch for testing and merging.Subsystem maintainers, meanwhile, didn't use patches to get topic branches \"upstream\" [= in Linus's git repo]. Linus just had the subsystem maintainers as git-remotes, and then, when nudged, fetched their integration branches, reviewed them, and merged them, with any communication about this occurring informally out-of-band. In other words, the patch flow was for low-trust collaboration, while direct fetch was for high-trust collaboration.Interestingly, in the LKML context, `git request-pull` is simply a formalization of the high-trust collaboration workflow (specifically, the out-of-band \"hey, fetch my branches and review them\" nudge email). It's not used for contribution, only integration; and it doesn't really do anything you can't do with an email \u2014 its only real advantages are in keeping the history of those requests within the repo itself, and for forcing requests to be specified in terms of exact git refs to prevent any confusion.reply"

      "While deep diving into the history of how digital computers evolved from the initial ENIAC era of the late 1940s to the IBM 360 and DEC PDPs of the early 60s, I was surprised by just how much fundamental 1950s tech engineering was driven by the massive effort (and budgets) to create the technology needed to enable the national air defense network NORAD would later manage.While a lot of the basic research existed on paper, turning that into functional 24/7 systems at mega-scale was an almost unimaginable engineering challenge. The fragments which already existed were little more than one-off prototype computers like ENIAC, none of which were remotely close to big enough, fast enough or reliable enough. So they were faced with creating pretty much the full stack from transistors to storage to networking to displays - all of which had to be several generations bigger, faster and better than anything that had ever been shown to even sort-of work on a lab bench. While the budgets were huge, the requirements were equally insane and there was huge pressure to deliver it ASAP. And \"it\" had to actually work and then be built, deployed and operated daily across dozens of locations. It ultimately involved dozens of huge companies, hundreds of sub-contractor firms and tens of thousands of people. Pretty much everything I'd ever heard about in 1960s computing, when I dug into where the fundamental tech came from, ended up tracing back to enabling something the air defense network needed in the 50s.I came away realizing the mid-60s scalable commercial computing industry I think of as my ancestral 'up-line' in computing, the 360/PDP systems which led to the 1970s 8-bit microprocessors which led to the 80s home computers anyone could own, would have all been at least a decade later without the crazy mad dash in the 1950s to enable the air defense build-out.reply",

      "I grew up in the Chicago suburbs, but my parents and my whole extended family are from an area in eastern Michigan, about 2 hours north of Detroit.Especially back then, the local economy was heavily dependent on Dow Chemical, who has a massive facility in the area. My grandfather worked there. He was one of the first people to ever handle Saran wrap. He also recalls hilarious stories, like a time when someone pranked the foreman by dumping some stuff in the soap dispenser that turned into a sticky, snotty goo when exposed to water. He also worked in an area that used lots of iodine for a couple years. His whole body was sunflower yellow when he came home from work, but he says he never got a cold!Some stories are more harrowing. There were air raid sirens to warn people when Dow was venting something into the atmosphere. If you heard the sirens, you went inside ASAP.And then there was the dioxin plant (aka agent orange). He says men in their 40s who worked in the dioxin plant looked like they were in their 80s. Many hard-working people died young there.Luckily, he was never in the Dioxin plant on a daily basis - he was a diesel mechanic and a welder. Had he been in the dioxin plant, he probably wouldn't be alive today to share those stories.

      "Fun fact, you can make a basic scope at home. It definitely is not easy but probably not as expensive as you might think (actually not much at all!).Ben Krasnow (Applied Science) has a few videos and blog posts on the topic[0,1,2]. The Tungsten Filaments can be expensive, but I sent an email to the company and they sent me some samples to play with. It's been years so I forgot who I contacted. I tried the Nalgene bottle method but honestly I could not get it to hold a tight enough vacuum. The electron beam was very unstable and it is just really hard to purge and backfill the \"chamber\". The hardest part is getting the beam control circuit. I never got that refined myself for clear images, but I'm sure I could have gotten it with more time (it was a DIY work project so other things took priorities[3]). For our purposes the beam mattered more, so we went with what we could get. But even \"failing\" I learned a lot and it was a ton of fun. It's pretty exciting to get a beam to produce.And keep in mind, even if you do get it fully running you shouldn't expect it to be anywhere near on par with the professional ones. Machining is great these days and we have a lot of advantages we can leverage as even hobbyists that shops couldn't get even a few decades ago, but we're talking about a high precision machine.If the idea of having one for fun excites you, then it is worth the go. It was one of the most fun things I've ever made (maybe only next to a sputtering gun, which was very successful). If you can CAD, do some basic electronics, have a lot of patience, and a decent vacuum pump[4], then you should give it a go.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIJ1jI1xDhY[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdjYVF4a6iU[2] https://benkrasnow.blogspot.com/2014/04/electron-beam-contro...[3] Resources were tight enough that I think I could have done better if I decided to fund it myself. Big thing I would say is that whenever working with vacuum stuff don't take shortcuts. It's better to act like a perfectionist as it'll save you time in the long run. When you're working with tiny things, well... the little things matter lol[4] I mean a vacuum pump, not a roughing pump. You don't need a turbo, but you do need a high vacuum.reply",

But I'm surprised the program doesn't crash (at the very least, I'm surprised it doesn't run out of memory eventually, as presumably libc can't actually detach those threads, and pthread_join() is never called).As this binary does a bunch of manual text parsing and string operations in C (including implementing a basic HTTP server), I'd recommend at the very least running it as an unprivileged user (which the author implicitly recommends via the provided systemd unit file) inside a container (which won't definitely save you, but is perhaps better than nothing).The program also uses unsafe C functions like sprintf().  A quick look at one of the instances suggests that the use is indeed safe, but that sort of thing raises red flags for me as to the safety of the program as a whole.And while it does process requests very quickly, it also appears to have no limit on the number of concurrent threads it will create to process each request, so... beware.reply",
