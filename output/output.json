      "Liquid capsaicin treatments for bird seed are an effective squirrel repellent.They also illustrate the evolution of this protein: birds have no receptors for capsaicin, while mammals do. Birds eat seeds mostly intactly. Their digestive systems are capable of breaking them down - but it's stochastic and some seeds make it through the bird undigested, being redistributed elsewhere. Obviously, having an agent sow your seeds widely is a fitness advantage, and so seedy plants are ultimately served well even if 90+% of their caloric investment into seeds goes into the birds.Mammals, on the other hand, have teeth - particularly molars. Mammals that eat seeds grind them apart orally before even swallowing. As a result, any seeds ingested by mammals are very likely to be completely destroyed. Plants - peppers, anyway - found a chemical irritant that repels the mammals without even being sensed by birds.I've used one such treatment (with an amusing logo illustrataion - https://i.imgur.com/JAl8vyW.png) to good effect to discourage squirrels at my feeder, so that they stick to my dedicated squirrel bungee with a log of compressed corn instead.\n \nreply",

      "Oh? Which pepper species and carrier mammal are involved here?Edit: DERP duh you mean humans. :D Literally made the comparison without recognizing it, too. /EditNot challenging you, just curious and not immediately finding the answer myself with a quick search.The capsaicin receptor is TRPV1, which is a critical protein for thermoregulation and detection of being burned. In other words, it's not just a quick and easy evolutionary path to have a mutation break the receptor for capsaicin and now be immune to the taste. Obviously the animals could evolve behavior or even simply learn as juveniles to tolerate or even enjoy the taste (as many humans do).There are some other interesting things that happen with avian carriers, like reductions in fungal infection and attractiveness to other predators (ants). https://www.washington.edu/news/2013/06/21/airborne-gut-acti...\n \nreply",

      "I applaud the author for putting thought into how to design digital controls, in contrast to the \"just put whatever garbage on a touch screen\" strategy most carmakers do today.However, I still question the benefit of this complex, modal control (you have to press a single knob to \"cycle between\" multiple modes). My ancient, 2016 car features three knobs. This luxury allows me to, without looking, adjust any of three settings (temp, fan, air location), as well as a button which does each seat heater, without any \"check what mode it's in, tap, look at the tiny screen, tap again if necessary\" step.True, in this trim, my car does not have a thermostat mode, which in theory is useful, but it is so trivial to modulate the temperature based on \"do I feel cold, hot or comfortable right now\" and reaching over to twist one of the controls anyway, and even in the other car I have which has this mode, I frequently need to adjust things anyway, except in that car some of the functions require multiple mode changes on the touch screen and looking away from the road.\n \nreply",
      "My 1997 Lexus has a knob that controls the digital climate control. Except that instead of a spinny position encoder, they used a knob with stops so you have tactile feedback for when the temperature is all the way up or down.This is the kind of detail that I love about a well engineered car.\n \nreply",
      "My 2004 5 series BMW had this (it was called iDrive). A command style knob that could move on an axis of sorts (up and down, left, right). You could also press it in. I absolutely hated it.\n \nreply",
      "That was among the first generations of iDrive. I was (and to some extent still am) skeptical, particularly given how overwhelmingly negative the reception was at the time. But, FWIW, the motoring press was later \u2013 as BMW apparently improved the system significantly \u2013 swayed to accept, and sometimes even praise, the iDrive. At least from about 2015-20, or possibly as early as 2010-15.Can't give any personal evaluation, as I've never (AFAICR) driven a BMW.\n \nreply",
      "Small review, 2013 BMW 335xi (drove for a test drive). \nLoved iDrive. Remained my benchmark for car infotainment UI for 10+ years. The main thing, you could DRVIE the car, aggressively, and give commands to infotainment without missing a beat.Truly a lost art today. Fond memories.\n \nreply",
      "Aggressive BMW driver. You don't say.\n \nreply",
      "I agree. I don't want a \"smart\" knob. I'm dreading going car shopping sometime this next year. I anticipate having to rule out a large pool of cars to keep my controls navigable without looking.\n \nreply",
      "My wife bought a new car with fully digital display a year ago. For me, I got a 2013 low mileage dumb car. Couldn't find anything new that I liked with my preferred level of UX technology (or lack of). I drive both equally and even a year later, I hate operating anything in her car. Once you get it dialed in, not too bad, but there's constantly edge cases of things you do infrequently and really have to search around for how to change a setting. The dealership always changes something when we take it for regular maintenance and it's always a PITA to figure it out how to get it back to normal.  Also, it seems impossible to set a default setting for many things. There's a feature that activates anti-glare on the rear mirrors, for me it makes driving at night impossible, and I can't and forget my preference. Every time the car starts my preference is overridden. It's maddening. The only saving grace is this feature only requires 2 clicks on the rear mirror (1 click of 2 physical buttons). I've memorized those clicks and can do them without having to go through screen clicks and hamburger menu hell.\n \nreply",
      "Don't forget that almost every car made in the last 5 years reports telemetry (including vehicle speed, accelerometer data, and location) back to the manufacturer who shares that data with third parties, sometimes including insurance companies.\n \nreply",
      "I've found one good solution to this problem (for AC, at least): go for a car with a good \"auto\" mode!I hardly ever touch my AC, I just leave it on auto and the car does the rest to get it to the right temperature as quickly as possible.I suspect this is what most automakers think the real solution should be, just make it easy enough to set a temp and leave the rest to the computer.\n \nreply"

Often you will read online of people experiencing multiple failures from drives purchased from the same batch.I cannot prove this because I have no idea about Blackblazes procurement patterns but I bought one of the better drives in this list (ST16000NM001G) and it failed within a year.When it comes to hard drives or storage more generally a better approach is protect yourself against down time with software raid and backups and pray that if a drive does fail it does so within the warranty period.\n \nreply",
      ">Often you will read online of people experiencing multiple failures from drives purchased from the same batchI'll toss in on that anecdata. This has happened to me a several times. In all these cases we were dealing with drives with more or less sequential serial numbers. In two instances they were just cache drives for our CDN nodes. Not a big deal, but I sure kept the remote hands busy those weeks trying to keep enough nodes online. In a prior job, it was our primary storage array. You'd think that RAID6+hot spare would be pretty robust, but 3 near simultaneous drive failures made a mockery of that. That was a bad day. The hot spare starting doing its thing with the first failure, and if it had finished rebuilding before the subsequent failures, we'd have been ok, but alas.\n \nreply",
      "This has been the \"conventional wisdom\" for a very long time. Is this one of those things that get \"lost with time\" and every generation has to rediscover it?Like, 25+ years ago I would've bought hard drives for just my personal usage in a software raid making sure I don't get consecutive serial numbers, but ones that are very different. I'd go to my local hardware shop and ask them specifically for that. They'd show me the drives / serial numbers before I ever even bought them for real.I even used different manufacturers at some point when they didn't have non consecutive serials. I lost some storage because the drives weren't exactly the same size even though the advertized size matched, but better than having the RAID and extra cost be for nothing.I can't fathom how anyone that is running drives in actual production wouldn't have been doing that.\n \nreply",

However unlike you, I didn't use backblaze's drive stats to inform my purchase. I just bought whatever was cheapest, knowing that any TCO reduction from higher reliability (at best, around 10%) would eaten up by the lack of discounts the \"best\" drive.

      "Hey Seth and Ayo - congrats on this launch. \nWhile I think there\u2019s certainly room for improvement, which I\u2019ll address below - this demo makes me feel that you both can keep grinding and succeed with this.\nThe main feedback I have is similar to others who asked how this is better than Cursor running with a react native codebase and iOS simulator running on the side. \nI read your response about being better at iOS/android specific things could be the case (for example, making it really nail payments and subscriptions could be useful) - but it is definitely going to be a tough battle. \nIf someone can only use your platform and reliably have a react native codebase (version controlled on GitHub), with working Supabase auth, and fully synced with Expo (so basically almost ready to go)- that would be pretty cool! \nI also think there\u2019s room for you guys to add value around some of the other annoying parts of launching a native app. \nIf your app was able to automatically make App Store creatives and essentially publish the app for me with some user-promoting - that would be sick\n \nreply",
      "How is this different from just using Cursor on my react-native codebase? Cursor in agent mode means: no copy paste, implements features and fixes errors iteratively, knows my codebase and adheres to existing patterns. If I need changes, I just ask Cursor and preview live app changes locally\n \nreply",
      "Cursor is quite a bit better as well at not adding erroneous code. Was testing a0 and it kept getting stuck in endless loops of errors. I'm sure they'll improve but it's pretty rough right now.\n \nreply",

      "I would guess Replit-like (or Vercel-like) automation of aspects that are RN-specific. Eg typical mobile integrations, databases, more focus on UI (design screens with drag and drop + LLM chat), secrets. Focusing means they\u2019re able to make features work better for just one type of developer, and can move faster. Cursor would need to solve for all types of development since their users probably do everything in all languages from web to mobile to backend etc.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, integrations like Supabase, In-App Purchases/Subscriptions setup, Notifications, and App Store submission\n \nreply",
      "Your title is honest, and your description of the limitations is honest. It is also pragmatic to allow you to try it without registering. This is the way to success.\n \nreply",
      "Thankyou!\n \nreply",
      "This is an awesome demo and I hope you succeed.I've dabbled in building a tool of this type and something I've learned is that making single-task demo apps (like chess or snake game) is much faster and simpler than making production-grade apps that could make a real business. In fact, the process of making these demo apps production ready (polishing the UI, adding features, etc.) would usually result in the user giving up. In our implementation, it was much trickier for the system to understand the nuances of polishing than getting the broad strokes of the initial demo. I'd love to know if you've ran into this and what your thoughts are on getting around it.\n \nreply"

      "I found this to be a fascinating dive into a potentially serious safety concern. I was impressed how simple the mitigations could be based on the recommendations in the report. I find the evidence credible for an attempt to burry the issue, but honestly I don't understand the motivation. At this stage I feel Boeing and the FAA could really stand to gain some good press from being extra proactive about such issues. Especially when the proposed mitigations seem like they would be relatively easy to implement, and should not be expensive for airlines from what I can see. It seems like the source being the engine manufacturer and consequently having the potential of affecting other jets including potentially the airbus A320 would only improve the incentives for Boeing to get out ahead of this, and demonstrate a safety culture. Does anyone understand the motivations that could lead to the response we have seen from the FAA and Boeing?\n \nreply",
      "From what I've read, CFM and Boeing committed back in December to making the software fix that's suggested in the video. https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/news/bird-strike-incident-se...Why FAA and EASA didn't require any procedure changes in the interim to prevent the issue is a very good question.\n \nreply",
      "Can they force an install? Or will it be a choice?I like Mentor Pilot and Air Disasters, so I know I\u2019ve heard of a few where the problem that caused an accident was already known and a fix was available but the airline just chose not to do it because they had that option. Or it was scheduled but hadn\u2019t been performed yet because it wasn\u2019t thought to be that critical.Having the FAA mandate the fix seems like it would be a much better option.\n \nreply",
      "Yes the FAA can issue what are called Airworthiness Directives and require an issue be resolved in the timeframe and manner they specify.The timeframe could be anything, but common forms are like:- Within the next X (flight) hours or Y calendar days- You don't have to, but additional inspection needed every X hours or Y days until you do- At next annual inspection- Immediate/before flying again (usually called an Emergency AD)\n \nreply",
      "This is a issue that may also affect Airbus aircraft, but so far, it has only caused problems on two Boeing planes. Like MCAS, it was not disclosed to pilots, prompting the FAA to recommend design changes and notify flight crews.https://simpleflying.com/boeing-cfm-international-update-737...\n \nreply",
      "Unfortunately, it seems that the internal FAA recommendations were not allowed to make their way into any kind of airworthiness directive.The recommendations include very basic procedure changes that mitigate the near term risks without any significant impact to operation, as well as recommendations for what probably amounts to a software change and upgrades to some of the pilot oxygen masks to effect a permanent fix.The only reason that we even know about the internal recommendations is that they were leaked to the press.Boeing released a pilot bulletin that basically says to go through the checklist quickly and to treat smoke in the cabin as a major failure, but stops short of recommending some very, very simple steps in aircraft configuration prior to takeoff that would completely mitigate the issue without negatively effecting flight performance.The major recommendation in the internal FAA bulletin is to use the APU bleed instead of the main engine bleed air to power the air conditioning and cabin pressurisation during the takeoff phase of flight, below 3000 feet AGL. I can see no reason to drag feet on this recommendation, other than the uncomfortable suggestion that perhaps this issue should have been addressed during certification. (It is yet another difference from older 737 design , like the deadly MCAS system, that was not disclosed to pilots transitioning to the new aircraft)\n \nreply",

      "Here's the full decision, which (like most decisions!) is largely written to be legible to non-lawyers: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ded.721...The core story seems to be: Westlaw writes and owns headnotes that help lawyers find legal cases about a particular topic. Ross paid people to translate those headnotes into new text, trained an AI on the translations, and used those to make a model that helps lawyers find legal cases about a particular topic. In that specific instance the court says this plan isn't fair use. If it was fair use, one could presumably just pay people to translate headnotes directly and make a Westlaw competitor, since translating headnotes is cheaper than writing new ones. And conversely if it isn't fair use where's the harm (the court notes no copyright violation was necessary for interoperability for example) -- one can still pay people to write fresh headnotes from caselaw and create the same training set.The court emphasizes \"Because the AI landscape is changing rapidly, I note for readers that only non-generative AI is before me today.\" But I'm not sure \"generative\" is that meaningful a distinction here.You can definitely see how AI companies will be hustling to distinguish this from \"we trained on copyrighted documents, and made a general purpose AI, and then people paid to use our AI to compete with the people who owned the documents.\" It's not quite the same, the connection is less direct, but it's not totally different.\n \nreply",
      "This is an interesting opinion, but there are aspects of it that I doubt will stand the test of time.One aspect is the court\u2019s ruling that West\u2019s headnotes are copyrightable even when they merely quote a court opinion verbatim, because the editorial decision to quote the material itself shows a \u201ccreative spark\u201d. It really isn\u2019t workable \u2014 in law specifically - for copyright to attach to the mere selection of a quote from a case to represent that case\u2019s holding on an issue. After all, we would expect many lawyers analyzing the case independently to converge on the same quotes!The key fact underlying all of this, I think, is that when Ross paid human annotators to write their own versions of the headnotes, they really did crib from West\u2019s wholesale rather than doing their own independent analysis. Source text was paraphrased using curiously similar language to West\u2019s paraphrasing. That, plus the fact that Ross was a directly competing product, is what I see as really driving this decision.The case has very little to say about the more commonly posed question of whether copyright is infringed in large-scale language modeling.\n \nreply",
      "> That, plus the fact that Ross was a directly competing product, is what I see as really driving this decision.The \"competing product\" thing is probably the most extreme part of this opinion.The most important fair use factor is if the use competes with the original work, but this is generally implied to be directly competes, i.e. if you translate someone else's book from English to French and want to sell the translation, the translation is going to be in direct competition for sales to people who speak both English and French. The customer is going to use the copy claiming fair use as a direct substitute for the original work, instead of buying it.This court is trying to extend that to anything downstream from it, which seems crazy. For example, \"multiple copies for classroom use\" is one of the explicit examples of fair use from the copyright statute, but schools are obviously teaching people intending to go into competition with the original author, and in general the idea that you can't read something if you ever intend to write something to sell in competition with it seems absurd and in contradiction to the common practices in reverse engineering.But this is also a district court opinion that isn't even binding on other courts, so we'll see what happens if it gets appealed.\n \nreply",
      "No that is not an extreme interpretation of the fair use factors. This is a routinely emphasized factor in fair use analyses for both copyright and trademark.  School fair use is different because that defense is written into the statute directly in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. Also, \u00a7 108 provides extensive protections for libraries and archives that go beyond fair use doctrines.The idea that the schools are encouraging the students to compete with the original authors of works taught in the classroom is fanciful by the meaning that courts usually apply to competition. Your example is different from this case in which Ross wanted to compete in the same market against West offering a similar service at a lower price. Another reason that the schools get a carveout is because it would make most education impractical without each school obtaining special licenses for public performance for every work referenced in the classroom.But maybe that also provokes the question as to if schools really deserve that kind of sweetheart treatment (a massive indirect subsidy), or does it over-privileges formal schools relative to the commons at large?\n \nreply",
      "I think this is the best takeaway. This case and its outcome is restricted to its facts. Most of the LLM activity today is very different than what happened here.\n \nreply",
      "If close paraphrase can be detected, this ought to be proof enough that some non-trivial element of creativity was involved in the original text. Because purely functional and necessary elements are not protected by copyright, even when they would otherwise be creative (this is technically known as the 'scenes \u00e0 faire' case) - and surely a \"quote\" which is unavoidable because it factually and unquestionably is the core of the ruling would have to fall under that.\n \nreply",
      "Interestingly, almost the entirety of the judge's opinion seems to be focused on the question of whether the translated notes are subject to copyright. It seems to completely ignore the question of whether training an AI on copyrighted material constitutes making a copy of that work in the first place. Am I missing something?The judge does note that no copyrighted material was distributed to users, because the AI doesn't output that information:> There is no factual dispute: Ross\u2019s output to an end user does not include a West headnote. What matters is not \u201cthe amount and substantiality of the portion used in making a copy, but rather the amount and substantiality of what is thereby made accessible to a public for which it may serve as a competing substitute.\u201d Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at 222 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Ross did not make West headnotes available to the public, Ross benefits from factor three.But he only does so as part of an analysis of whether there's a valid fair use defense for Ross's copying of the head notes, ignoring the obvious (to me) point that if no copyrighted material was distributed to end users, how can this even be a violation of copyright in the first place?\n \nreply",
      "Ross evidently copied and used the text himself. It's like Ross creating an unauthorized volume of West's books, perhaps with a twist.Obscurity \u2260 legal compliance.\n \nreply",

      "I did something similar but using a K80 and M40 I dug up from eBay for pennies. Be advised though, stay as far away as possible from the K80 - the drivers were one of the most painful tech things I've ever had to endure, even if 24GB of VRAM for 50 bucks sounds incredibly appealing. That said, I had a decent-ish HP workstation laying around with 1200 watt power supply so I had where to put those two in. The one thing to note here is that these types of GPUs do not have a cooling of their own. My solution was to 3d print a bunch of brackets and attach several Noctua fans and have them blow at full speed 24/7. Surprisingly it worked way better than I expected - I've never gone above 60 degrees. As a side efffect, the CPUs are also benefiting from this hack: at idle, they are in the mid-20 degrees range. Mind you, the noctua fans are located on the front and the back of the case: the ones on the front act as an intake and the ones on the back as exhaust and there's two more inside the case that are stuck in front of the GPUs.The workstation was refurbished for just over 600 bucks, and another 120 bucks for the GPUs and another ~60 for the fans.Edit: and before someone asks - no I have not uploaded the STL's anywhere cause I haven't had the time but also since this is a very niche use case, though I might: the back(exhaust) bracket came out brilliant the first try - it was a sub-millimeter fit.

Mostly by throwing absurd amounts of money at the problem. Many of those billions go towards building cheap or free services that operate at a significant loss. The tech giants that run them all are hoping to attract as many users as possible, so that they can capture the market, and become the dominant or only party that can offer them. It is the classic Silicon Valley playbook. Once dominance is reached, expect the enshittification to begin.A likely way to earn back all that money for developing these LLMs will be by tweaking their outputs to the liking of whoever pays the most. An example of what that such tweaking looks like is the refusal of DeepSeek's R1 to discuss what happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989. That one is obviously politically motivated, but ad-funded services won't exactly be fun either. In the future, I fully expect to be able to have a fra"

Maybe longer than we think given that we still have conductors and pilots.The startup I was at just wound down last December and I interviewed with a handful of companies.  None had any code reviews as part of their process, even though they probably already have engineers using Copilot or Cursor.There's only been one company, a YC startup, that I interviewed with that incorporated a code review (as the first round no less).  I ended up creating a lightweight, open source app[0] for teams to incorporate code reviews into the interview process more easily after really enjoying that process with the startup.[0] https://coderev.app\n \nreply",
      "My belief is that software engineering benchmarks are still a poor proxy for performance on real world software engineers tasks, and that there's a decent chance a new model might saturate a benchmark while being kind of underwhelming.A simple example, if a human scored 50% on SWE-bench verified, it's fair to say that this person is a very competent software engineer.  Popular frontier models like Claude Sonnet and OpenAI's o3 can score 50% on SWE-bench, and can score even higher with special tooling, but compared to an actual human software engineer can't seem to competently perform a lot of programming tasks on their own.Although, if a model did consistently score more than 99% on various software engineering benchmarks that might be different, as it would imply a very real sense of competence.  That's a pretty substantial if though.  To my knowledge there isn't a single model out there that can consistently score more than 99% on any given benchmark.  The o1 model scored very well on certain MMLU categories, 98.1% on college mathematics, but I'm not sure if this result will continue to hold on a similar benchmark evaluating college-level undergraduate mathematics.Also, something else to consider, we take for granted how often we're able to perform tasks with more than 99% accuracy and how quickly things would fall apart if this weren't the case.  If the average human driver was only able to make an accident-free trip only 99% of the time that would imply that they'd get in a wreck every 100th time they drive their car.Granted, software engineering might be the exception to this rule, but then again, depends on what you're measuring.  When it comes to more-or-less discrete steps, we're arguably pretty good at writing programs that capture our intent, and I could foresee an AI that only gets this right 99% of the time to be a pain in the ass to work with.  If a feature ticket requires 10 different sub-tasks to be done correctly, then an AI that can do each sub-task correctly 99% of the time has a roughly 90% chance of doing the whole feature ticket correctly, which is still good but compounded over many feature tickets could be exhausting to deal with.  An AI that has only a 90% chance of doing each sub-task correctly would almost certainly fail to implement this hypothetical feature ticket.Mind you, statistics is not my domain so if there are any errors in my logic please correct me.\n \nreply",
