      "Just tested the new Opus 4.6 (1M context) on a fun needle-in-a-haystack challenge: finding every spell in all Harry Potter books.All 7 books come to ~1.75M tokens, so they don't quite fit yet. (At this rate of progress, mid-April should do it ) For now you can fit the first 4 books (~733K tokens).Results: Opus 4.6 found 49 out of 50 officially documented spells across those 4 books. The only miss was \"Slugulus Eructo\" (a vomiting spell).Freaking impressive!reply",
      "There's lots of websites that list the spells. It's well documented. Could Claude simply be regurgitating knowledge from the web? Example:https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_spellsreply",
      "It didn't use web search. But for sure it has some internal knowledge already. It's not a perfect needle in the hay stack problem but gemini flash was much worse when I tested it last time.reply",
      "If you want to really test this, search/replace the names with your own random ones and see if it lists those.Otherwise, LLMs have most of the books memorised anyway: https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/06/study-metas-llama-3...reply",
      "Couldn't you just ask the LLM which 50 (or 49) spells appear in the first four Harry Potter books without the data for comparison?reply",
      "It's not going to be as consistent. It may get bored of listing them (you know how you can ask for many examples and get 10 in response?), or omit some minor ones for other reasons.By replacing the names with something unique, you'll get much more certainty.reply",
      "might not work well, but by navigating to a very harry potter dominant part of latent space by preconditioning on the books you make it more likely to get good results. An example would be taking a base model and prompting \"what follows is the book 'X'\" it may or may not regurgitate the book correctly. Give it a chunk of the first chapter and let it regurgitate from there and you tend to get fairly faithful recovery, especially for things on gutenberg.So it might be there, by predcondiditioning latent space to the area of harry potter world, you make it so much more probable that the full spell list is regurgitated from online resources that were also read, while asking naive might get it sometimes, and sometimes not.the books act like a hypnotic trigger, and may not represent a generalized skill. Hence why replacing with random words would help clarify. if you still get the origional spells, regurgitation confirmed, if it finds the spells, it could be doing what we think. An even better test would be to replace all spell references AND jumble chapters around. This way it cant even \"know\" where to \"look\" for the spell names from training.reply",
      "This underestimates how much of the Internet is actually compressed into and is an integral part of the model's weights. Gemini 2.5 can recite the first Harry Potter book verbatim for over 75% of the book.reply",
      "I think the OP was implying that it's probably already baked into its training data. No need to search the web for that.reply",
      "Do the same experiment in the Claude web UI. And explicitly turn web searches off. It got almost all of them for me over a couple of prompts. That stuff is already in its training data.reply"

      "The real problem is, I'm so danged familiar with the MySQL toolset.I've fixed absolutely terrifying replication issues, include a monster split brain where we had to hand pick off transactions and replay them against the new master. We've written a binlog parsing as an event source to clear application caching. I can talk to you about how locking works, when it doesn't (phantom locks anyone?), how events work (and will fail) and many other things I never set out to learn but just sort of had to.While I'd love to \"just use Postgres\" I feel the tool you know is perhaps the better choice. From the fandom online, it's overall probably the better DBMS, but I would just be useless in a Postgres world right now. Sorta strapped my saddle to the wrong start unfortunately.reply",
      "I recently started digging into databases for the first time since college, and from a novice's perspective, postgres is absolutely magical. You can throw in 10M+ rows across twenty columns, spread over five tables, add some indices, and get sub-100ms queries for virtually anything you want. If something doesn't work, you just ask it for an analysis and immediately know what index to add or how to fix your query. It blows my mind. Modern databases are miracles.reply",
      "I don't mean this as a knock on you, but your comment is a bit funny to me because it has very little to do with \"modern\" databases.What you're describing would probably have been equally possible with Postgres from 20 years ago, running on an average desktop PC from 20 years ago. (Or maybe even with SQLite from 20 years ago, for that matter.)Don't get me wrong, Postgres has gotten a lot better since 2006. But most of the improvements have been in terms of more advanced query functionality, or optimizations for those advanced queries, or administration/operational features (e.g. replication, backups, security).reply",
      "The article actually points out a number of things only added after 2006, such as full-text search, JSONB, etc. Twenty years ago your full-text search option is just LIKE '%keyword%'. And it would be both slower than less effective than real full-text search. It clearly wasn\u2019t \u201csub-100ms queries for virtually anything you want\u201d like GP said.reply",

      "I do agree, I don\u2019t know why more people don\u2019t just use Postgres. If I\u2019m doing data exploration with lots of data (e.g., GIS, nD vectors), I\u2019ll just spin up a Postgres.app on my macOS laptop, install what little I need, and it just works and is plenty fast for my needs. It\u2019s a really great choice for a lot of domains.That being said, while I think Postgres is \u201cthe right tool for the job\u201d in many cases, sometimes you just want (relative) simplicity, both in terms of complexity and deployment, and should use something like SQLite. I think it\u2019s unwise to understate simplicity, and I use it to run a few medium-traffic servers (at least, medium traffic for the hardware I run it on).reply",
      "> in many cases, sometimes you just want (relative) simplicity, both in terms of complexity and deployment, and should use something like SQLite.So many times when trying to just go for simplicity with SQLite it takes me like one working day until I run up against enough annoyances to where resolving those is more work than setting up the \"set up and forget\" postgres instance.Granted, this is for personal stuff... but \"Postgres packaged for low maintenance\" is present in a lot of OS package managers! Even for smaller data analysis work SQLite perf leads _loads_ to be desired (once had QGIS struggling with a sqlite DB... pg made everything mostly instant. Indices etc... but stuff I _couldn't easily get with sqlite_)If SQLite works for you that's great, I do think it's worth it for people to _try_ to do simple pg setups to understand just how painful it is to use pg (for me: not that high)reply",
      "Oh, yes, that's one of my points! I think Postgres is a great way to deal with tons of data, and it's really the only thing I use to do any sort of analysis or informatics (that and Parquet + Dask).reply",
      "I am also a fan of SQLite. One of the best parts during development is how easy it is to spin up and spin down databases for full integration tests without containers or anything. It also simplifies backups, and is probably good enough.reply"

      "Whats interesting to me is that these gpt-5.3 and opus-4.6 are diverging philosophically and really in the same way that actual engineers and orgs have diverged philosophicallyWith Codex (5.3), the framing is an interactive collaborator: you steer it mid-execution, stay in the loop, course-correct as it works.With Opus 4.6, the emphasis is the opposite: a more autonomous, agentic, thoughtful system that plans deeply, runs longer, and asks less of the human.that feels like a reflection of a real split in how people think llm-based coding should work...some want tight human-in-the-loop control and others want to delegate whole chunks of work and review the resultInterested to see if we eventually see models optimize for those two philosophies and 3rd, 4th, 5th philosophies that will emerge in the coming years.Maybe it will be less about benchmarks and more about different ideas of what working-with-ai meansreply",

      "I'm personally 100% convinced (assuming prices stay reasonable) that the Codex approach is here to stay.Having a human in the loop eliminates all the problems that LLMs have and continously reviewing small'ish chunks of code works really well from my experience.It saves so much time having Codex do all the plumbing so you can focus on the actual \"core\" part of a feature.LLMs still (and I doubt that changes) can't think and generalize. If I tell Codex to implement 3 features he won't stop and find a general solution that unifies them unless explicitly told to. This makes it kinda pointless for the \"full autonomy\" approach since effecitly code quality and abstractions completely go down the drain over time. That's fine if it's just prototyping or \"throwaway\" scripts but for bigger codebases where longevity matters it's a dealbreaker.reply"

      "This is such a lovely balanced thoughtful refreshingly hype-free post to read. 2025 really was the year when things shifted and many first-rate developers (often previously AI skeptics, as Mitchell was) found the tools had actually got good enough that they could incorporate AI agents into their workflows.It's a shame that AI coding tools have become such a polarizing issue among developers. I understand the reasons, but I wish there had been a smoother path to this future. The early LLMs like GPT-3 could sort of code enough for it to look like there was a lot of potential, and so there was a lot of hype to drum up investment and a lot of promises made that weren't really viable with the tech as it was then. This created a large number of AI skeptics (of whom I was one, for a while) and a whole bunch of cynicism and suspicion and resistance amongst a large swathe of developers. But could it have been different? It seems a lot of transformative new tech is fated to evolve this way. Early aircraft were extremely unreliable and dangerous and not yet worthy of the promises being made about them, but eventually with enough evolution and lessons learned we got the  Douglas DC-3, and then in the end the 747.If you're a developer who still doesn't believe that AI tools are useful, I would recommend you go read Mitchell's post, and give Claude Code a trial run like he did.  Try and forget about the annoying hype and the vibe-coding influencers and the noise and just treat it like any new tool you might put through its paces. There are many important conversations about AI to be had, it has plenty of downsides, but a proper discussion begins with close engagement with the tools.reply",
      "I skimmed over it, and didn\u2019t find any discussion of:  - Pull requests\n  - Merge requests\n  - Code review\n\nI feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills. Are SWE supposed to move away from code review, one of the core activities for the profession?

Yes, we know that apps and what not can be bootstrapped from nothing by \u201cagentic coding\u201d.We need to read this code, right?

      "GPT-4 showed the potential but the automated workflows (context management, loops, test-running) and pure execution speed to handle all that \"reasoning\"/workflows (remember watching characters pop in slowly in GPT-4 streaming API response calls) are gamechangers.The workflow automation and better (and model-directed) context management are all obvious in retrospect but a lot of people (like myself) were instead focused on IDE integration and such vs `grep` and the like. Maybe multi-agent with task boards is the next thing, but it feels like that might also start to outrun the ability to sensibly design and test new features for non-greenfield/non-port projects. Who knows yet.I think it's still very valuable for someone to dig in to the underlying models periodically (insomuch as the APIs even expose the same level of raw stuff anymore) to get a feeling for what's reliable to one-shot vs what's easily correctable by a \"ran the tests, saw it was wrong, fixed it\" loop. If you don't have a good sense of that, it's easy to get overambitious and end up with something you don't like if you're the sort of person who cares at all about what the code looks like.reply",
      "Your sentiment resonates with me a lot. I wonder what we\u2019ll consider the inflection point 10 years from now. It seemed like the zeitgeist was screaming about scaling limits and running out of training data, then we got Claude code, sonnet 4.5, then Opus 4.5 and no ones looked back since.reply",
      "I wonder too. It might be that progress on the underlying models is going to plateau, or it might be that we haven't yet reached what in retrospect will be the biggest inflection point. Technological developments can seem to make sense in hindsight as a story of continuous progress when the dust has settled and we can write and tell the history, but when you go back and look at the full range of voices in the historical sources you realize just how deeply nothing was clear to anyone at all at the time it was happening because everyone was hurtling into the unknown future with a fog of war in front of them. In 1910 I'd say it would have been perfectly reasonable to predict airplanes would remain a terrifying curiosity reserved for daredevils only (and people did); or conversely, in the 1960s a lot of commentators thought that the future of passenger air travel in the 70s and 80s would be supersonic jets. I keep this in mind and don't really pay too much attention to over-confident predictions about the technological future.reply",
      "Is there any reason to use Claude Code specifically over Codex or Gemini? I\u2019ve found the both Codex and Gemini similar in results,  but I never tried Claude because of I keep hearing usage runs out so fast on pro plans and there\u2019s no free trial for the CLI.reply",
      "I mostly mentioned Claude Code because it's what Mitchell first tried according to his post, and it's what I personally use. From what I hear Codex is pretty comparable; it has a lot of fans. There are definitely some differences and strengths and weaknesses of both the CLIs and the underlying LLMs that others who use more than one tool might want to weight in on, but they're all fairly comparable. (Although, we'll see how the new models released from Anthropic and OpenAI today stack up.) Codex and Gemini CLI are basically Claude Code clones with different LLMs behind them, after all.reply",
      "IME Gemini is pretty slow in comparison to Claude - but hey, it's super cheap at least.But that speed makes a pretty significant difference in experience.If you wait a couple minutes and then give the model a bunch of feedback about what you want done differently, and then have to wait again, it gets annoying fast.If the feedback loop is much tighter things feel much more engaging.

      "Is this a very high quality website that simply tries to do one thing well and isn\u2019t trying to monetize?!I know it\u2019s foolish but I want to daydream for a bit that the Web turned out differently. That at some point around Space Jam the people decided that a business being online was a deeply offensive invasion of Our space and would be boycotted, so they gave up on trying.  And what was left was lots and lots of webpages like this among the personal pages and pages about nothing. And that services like search engines were provided by universities. And undergrads who attended would take their turn working for these services as a sort of community service rite of passage.We have web rings and web rungs (more of a ladder topology) and nothing was for sale but the community would be fine with the occasional grandson selling meemaw\u2019s knit scarfs. Oh, and Zombo Com was tolerated given its sheer breadth of utility.I want to stay up well past my bedtime some summer night, finding some new web zone filled with a clever collection of someone\u2019s identity they shared with the world.  Maybe while a breeze gently wanders in through an open window and a train ventures forth in the distance.reply",
      "As kind of a knot guy, unlike other commenters this is my #1 favorite knot site.Other sites with animated 3D models might be useful for visualizing the topology of knots, or something. But for actually tying the knots I find this site and its curated photos much more practically useful. The fact that it's not literally animated is a feature; it shows the key points rather than every detail.And the photos are just clearer and better than any other resource. (If you look closely you'll see a lot of editing work has been done on them like to minimize the diff between consecutive photos.)Only downside is that I wish it had more minor knots!reply",
      "How are more people not obsessed with knots?It's the purest form of human creativity! It's nothing but a strait line and humans have figured out how to twist and turn it into a million different objects and endless uses.  Our entire species has propelled itself into a realm of knowledge built on the fundamental twisting of a simple lines and observing those properties.The clothes you wear are knots. Every surgery you have ends in knots. The combined effect of knots on our technology and understanding of the world is fascinating.Only humans can see a rope, have a picture in their heads of what it should look like and then set forth on creating it. It's just such a precious nugget of what it means to be human and have the urge to fuck around with shit.reply",
      "To anyone into knots, I recommend Knots 3D on Android. It is really handy because most people keeps the phone with them all the time. Beautiful and well maintained app. It's not overwhelming, in the sense that it doesn't try to add every existing knot in the same database, it has usage, which gives context, history and specially related knots, which makes it possible to compare different related knots that are usually used for the same thing.reply",
      "It seems to be a nice, handmade, thoughtful collection. Things like being able to flip the images is a nice touch.However, name \"animated\" will only lead to disappointment for people finding slide shows of humans.

      "This is still so relevant now:> This Orwellian preoccupation with the minutiae of 'historical proof' is\ntypical of the political sectarian who is always quoting what has been said\nand done in the past to prove a point to someone on the other side who is\nalways quoting something to the opposite effect that has been said and done. As any politician knows, no evidence of any kind is ever required. It is\nonly necessary to make a statement - any statement - forcefully enough to\nhave an audience believe it. No one will check the lie against the facts,\nand, if they do, they will disbelieve the facts.reply",
      "Relevant because it's universal human nature, to only have domain over a narrow context in life, and assert what's good/bad based on that limited view with others who occupy a different one. We use justifications which make sense to us that others rightly disagree with. It's not left politics, it's not right politics, it's not just politics, it's everything. Anyone who asserts they are beyond it are full of it.reply",
      "Orwell and Asimov are talking about something entirely different than drawing flawed conclusions due to inexperience\u2014they\u2019re talking about people with access to the facts and choosing not to believe them.For instance, Alex Pretti\u2019s murder was recorded from several angles and yet the American right still broadly claims that he attacked the agents, that he pulled his gun on them, etc. You don\u2019t need to be an expert in policing or anything else to watch those videos and see that those narratives are plainly false. That\u2019s of course only one example, but there are many others.reply",

Propaganda, misinformation, addiction, emotional manipulation, mind rot, overstimulation, excessive advertising, even moral panics blaming it for violence and deviant behavior.Television didn't create self-reinforcing bubbles of hyperreality because it represented a corporate model of reality applied to an entire culture. It could only do so much being a one-way means of communication, but bear in mind all most people do with social media now is consume. The more social media becomes like television, the worse it becomes.reply",
      "I would go so far as to say that the criticisms of broadcast television were completely correct; and that for all the problems of modern centralized social media and other internet use, one major good thing that it has done is kill off broadcast television. It is much easier now than it was for much of the 20th century for random ordinary people who weren't members of established mass media organizations to broadcast their ideas to the world, and try to build an audience that cares about their message. And even though this results in a lot of bad content being made (or just content that is uninteresting to you personally), it also allows a lot of gems to rise to people's attention that never would have under the old mass culture making system.reply",

      "I\u2019ll always upvote Bradbury; what a master. Isaac Asimov used to talk about \u201cthe big 3\u201d of science fiction of his era: himself (natch), Arthur C Clarke, and Ray Bradbury. The more I read of all those cats, and boy have I read them, I came to see that Asimov was wrong, and that Bradbury was a different and better writer altogether.Bradbury\u2019s stories are about people, deeply real and deeply feeling people. This thread is young and already comments are about how Bradbury made folks feel. He was a humanist, like Ursula LeGuin, and less interested in exactly how the ray guns worked. Frank Herbert seems like this to me as well, very humane, opposite of Greg Bear and Kim Stanley Robinson and (later stage) Neal Stephenson.If you love Bradbury then take a look at Ian McDonald. When I read \u201cRainmaker Cometh\u201d for the first time I had to do a double-take, so sure I was that it was a new Bradbury story.reply",
      "Borges famously wrote a preface to a Spanish-language edition of \"The martian chronicles\".  Excerpt:\"Ray Bradbury has preferred (unknowingly, perhaps, and by secret inspiration of his genius) an elegiac tone. Martians, who at the beginning of the book are horrible, deserve his pity when annihilation reaches them. Men vanquish and the author is not proud of their victory. He announces with sadness and disappointment the future expansion of mankind over the red planet - that his prophecy reveals as a desert of vague blue sand, with ruins of chess-like cities and yellow sunsets and ancient ships to wander on the sand.Other authors stamp a coming date and we don't believe them, because we know it is a literary convention; Bradbury writes 2004 and we feel the gravitation, the fatigue, the vast and vague accumulation of the past - the 'dark backward and abysm of Time' from the Shakespeare verse. Already the Renaissance had noted, by mouth of Giordano Bruno and of Bacon, that the real Ancient Ones are us, and not the men from Genesis or Homer.What has this man from Illinois done, I ask myself when closing the pages of his book, that episodes from the conquest of another planet fill me with horror and loneliness?How can these fantasies touch me, and in such an intimate way? All literature (I dare reply) is symbolic; there are a few fundamental experiences and it is indifferent that a writer, to transmit them, recurs to the fantastic or the real, to Macbeth or to Rascolnikov, to the Belgium invasion in August 1914 or to an invasion of Mars. Who cares about the novel, or novelry of science fiction? In this book of ghostly appearance, Bradbury has placed his long empty Sundays, his American tedium, his loneliness, like Sinclair Lewis did on Main Street.\"reply",
      "Strong second here. I\u2019ve read lots and lots of all three.Clarke wrote good stories. Asimov had some good ideas but was a fairly poor writer of fiction (his characters and dialog, in particular, are rarely better than terrible, and many of his stories hinge on a single gee-what-if shower thought and have little more going for them) and is in my estimation easily the weakest of the three.Bradbury\u2026 is good good. He had a combo of talent and a mind to put it to a certain kind of use, some (or many) elements of which the other two did not possess. I would unhesitatingly recommend Bradbury to a literary fiction reader who\u2019s not much on genre fiction for its own sake, and might not even bother to suggest where they start. I would selectively recommend bits of Clarke\u2019s work where he\u2019s treading a bit closer to the sublime than usual, or some of his short stories that are at least competent, fun short reads with some ideas or imagery or the odd line that sticks with you. I might not recommend any Asimov at all.Some authors are good, no italics. Bradbury is good.reply",
      "> Bradbury\u2019s stories are about people, deeply real and deeply feeling people. ... and less interested in exactly how the ray guns worked.Maybe this is why I never really got Bradbury. When I read scifi, I can't help but consider the logic of the world that's being described, and Bradbury's worlds aren't really logical (e.g. who would live on such a strict timetable? wouldn't all the singing and rhyming be annoying? how is the house still being powered?). But it makes a lot more sense if the point is to convey feelings. Kind of like an impressionist painting I suppose.reply",
      "I also love sci fi that explores the human condition. However my first foray into Bradbury (The Martian Chronicles) left me a bit cold. Are there other works you'd recommend?reply",
      "Short stories are, IMO, where he really shines. The Illustrated Man is a good collection to start with, as is The Golden Apples of the Sun. But read them slowly, and (this may be a controversial statement) in a physical paper book.reply"
