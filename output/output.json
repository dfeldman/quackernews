      "I hope this works better than 3.0 ProI'm a former Googler and know some people near the team, so I mildly root for them to at least do well, but Gemini is consistently the most frustrating model I've used for development.It's stunningly good at reasoning, design, and generating the raw code, but it just falls over a lot when actually trying to get things done, especially compared to Claude Opus.Within VS Code Copilot Claude will have a good mix of thinking streams and responses to the user. Gemini will almost completely use thinking tokens, and then just do something but not tell you what it did. If you don't look at the thinking tokens you can't tell what happened, but the thinking token stream is crap. It's all \"I'm now completely immersed in the problem...\". Gemini also frequently gets twisted around, stuck in loops, and unable to make forward progress. It's bad at using tools and tries to edit files in weird ways instead of using the provided text editing tools. In Copilot it, won't stop and ask clarifying questions, though in Gemini CLI it will.So I've tried to adopt a plan-in-Gemini, execute-in-Claude approach, but while I'm doing that I might as well just stay in Claude. The experience is just so much better.For as much as I hear Google's pulling ahead, Anthropic seems to be to me, from a practical POV. I hope Googlers on Gemini are actually trying these things out in real projects, not just one-shotting a game and calling it a win.reply",
      "Yes, this is very true and it speaks strongly to this wayward notion of 'models' - it depends so much on the tuning, the harness, the tools.I think it speaks to the broader notion of AGI as well.Claude is definitively trained on the process of coding not just the code, that much is clear.Codex has the same limitation but not quite as bad.This may be a result of Anthropic using 'user cues' with respect to what are good completions and not, and feeding that into the tuning, among other things.Anthropic is winning coding and related tasks because they're focused on that, Google is probably oriented towards a more general solution, and so, it's stuck in 'jack of all trades master of none' mode.reply",
      "Google are stuck because they have to compete with OpenAI. If they don\u2019t, they face an existential threat to their advertising business.But then they leave the door open for Anthropic on coding, enterprise and agentic workflows. Sensibly, that\u2019s what they seem to be doing.That said Gemini is noticeably worse than ChatGPT (it\u2019s quite erratic) and Anthropic\u2019s work on coding / reasoning seems to be filtering back to its chatbot.So right now it feels like Anthropic is doing great, OpenAI is slowing but has significant mindshare, and Google are in there competing but their game plan seems a bit of a mess.reply",
      "Google might be a mess now, but they have time.  OpenAI and Anthropic are on barrowed time, Google has a built in money printer.  They just need to outlast the others.reply",
      "Plus they started making AI processors 11 years ago and invented the math behind \u201cGPTs\u201d 9 years ago. Gemini is way cheaper to run for them than it does for everyone else.I think Gemini is really built for their biggest market \u2014 Google Search. You ask questions and get answers.I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll figure out agentic flows. Google is always a mess when it comes to product. Don\u2019t forget the Google chat sagas where it seems as if different parts of the company were making the same product.reply",
      "Why do you assume they\u2019ll figure it out when they pretty consistently mess things up?reply",
      "They have much much less time than one would think. Their ads business is about to go into freefall, this will cause the whole company to spiral.reply",
      "Yup, you got it. It's a weird situation for sure.You know what's also weird: Gem3 'Pro' is pretty dumb.OAI has 'thinking levels' which work pretty well, it's nice to have the 'super duper' button - but also - they have the 'Pro' product which is another model altogether and thinks for 20 min. It's different than 'Research'.OAI Pro (+ maybe Spark) is the only reason I have OAI sub. Neither Anthropic nor Google seem to want to try to compete.I feel for the head of Google AI, they're probably pulled in major different directions all the time ...reply",
      "If you want that level of research I suggest you ask the model to draft a markdown plan with \"[ ]\" gates for todo items, and plan it in as many steps as needed. Then ask another LLM to review the plan, judge it. In the end use the plan as the execution state tracker, the model solves one by one the checkboxes.Using this method I could recreate \"deep research\" mode on a private collection of documents in a few minutes. A markdown file can be like a script or playbook, just use checkboxes for progress. This works for models that have file storage and edit tools, which is most, starting with any coding agent.reply",
      "OAI Pro is not a 'research' tool in that sense, and it's definitely different than the 'deep research' options avail on most platforms, as I indicated.It's a different kind of solution altogether.I suggest trying it.reply"

      "This is quite cool. Makes me philosophical: isn't it odd, that this is like an Excel template? Like a \"domain model\" template? In this case, presented nicely in a TUI that makes basic CRUD workflows work.Most SaaS companies are just that:\n1) Curated domain model (stored in their cloud db)\n2) Some way for users do to almost raw CRUD on the tables\n3) Curated high-level domain specific workflows that do n CRUD calls underneathSo many of these SaaS apps could have been a simple Excel / domain model template like Micasa.But it seems like we haven't \"cracked\" the perfect UI on top of relational DBs.Excel: Good: raw CRUD. Bad: too many degrees of freedom + the possibility to edit the domain model itself. That's too much for most users.TUI: Good: raw CRUD with some guardrails, limited possibility to adjust the domain model / not by accident. Keyboard shortcuts, for professionals. Bad: inaccessible for non-tech end users + hard to build good UX for high-level domain specific workflows.Full Web UI: Good: accessible for all. Great for high-level domain-specific workflows.

      "There was once a time when tools like Microsoft Access and FileMaker Pro were common. These were a database and custom GUI designed using a drag and drop editor. I don't know whether these apps ever had network server capability or if they were always offline or why they died out. It was a bit before my timereply",
      "FileMarker Pro had a dedicated server product (FileMaker Server) that you could use for multi-user access. Claris still sells it: https://www.claris.com/filemaker/Microsoft Access was strictly file based. You could drop the .mdb/.accdb file on a SMB share and it would support basic concurrency via lock files. However, you could also swap out the internal database engine (Jet) with anything else via ODBC, so your Access database could connect to a remote Microsoft SQL Server instance - or even MySQL/Postgres.Back in high school, I even wired up an Access database to give a graphical frontend to an accounting app running on an IBM AS/400 mainframe. ODBC made it easy, and Access itself didn't really care where the data lived.reply",

      "I wonder what the state of workflow engines is these days. Back in the (distant, distant) past, everything seemed to use Lotus Notes.

Undeniably the world's power-tool.I've never liked them, never learned to work with them, and instead spent 20 years learning to program and make my own db-backed crud interfaces.Your points are spot on. But I'd like to defend a sliver of my stubbornness about it all; a product built for a specific use or domain exports the _education_ and information architecture of that domain. Sure it's all rows and columns in a db, and a spreadsheet is just that exposed to the user, but a \"product\" and its creator/company gets to design and prescribe a learning experience.

      "Let's say a journalist writes an excellent article about something political of serious import. I'm fine with paying for that article to get access to it.But, really, the article is a lot more useful to me if other people can access it too. Since everyone can vote, I want the whole populace to be informed, even poor people.I wonder if there is a viable business model where for each article, readers can pay to unlock it not just for themselves, but for everyone. The price would obviously have to be higher since you aren't just buying it for yourself. But perhaps the sense of \"I'm helping build a better-informed world and helping broadcast my values\" would encourage people to pay that higher price.Maybe you could do something cumulative and Kickstarter-like where there's a threshold for the article to be unlocked and anyone can chip in to getting it over the line. This would take advantage of human psychology that we like being part of something bigger than ourselves.And it would hopefully have the emergent property that news that people feels is actually valuable gets spread more widely than useless junk.reply",
      "I wonder if there is a viable business model where for each article, readers can pay to unlock it not just for themselves, but for everyone. The price would obviously have to be higher since you aren't just buying it for yourself. But perhaps the sense of \"I'm helping build a better-informed world and helping broadcast my values\" would encourage people to pay that higher price.What you're asking for is the system we already have, except at a micro level rather than a macro level. Rich people buy out newspapers to signal-boost their own preferred messages to the public.I think it's questionable that the \"news that people feel is actually valuable\" is what really ought to be spread. Some of the most valuable news is local reporting on the daily business of municipal governments. Regular people are notoriously uninterested in local politics, despite the outsized impact it has on their lives. Many of the most mundane decisions made in municipal councils go completely unnoticed yet they can destroy whole communities in the long run.reply",
      "Sorry to be the wet blanket but what you're arguing for, advocacy, is by far the worst and most ineffective form of doing politics. Talking about things doesn't convince anyone. Talking to the small amounts of people that agree doesn't get the balling moving.Want to know what does? Organizing. Getting people that disagree with you, to agree with you. That never happens through advocacy, you have to organize.reply",
      "Organizing is often less about convincing people that are in hard opposition and more about moving ppl that are pro, soft or uninformed. Then moving those people to take actions that advance the ball in their own interests or the interest of allies. You can really only move people that are hard against when the stakes are low and they have no ideological commitment against what you are suggesting. Getting someone to change ideologically is a slow or impossible process that comes from changes in social position and inner changes.reply",
      "I really like this idea for a lot of reasons, but especially the last one. It seems like it creates an incentive model that's much closer to rewarding quality investigative journalism rather than the viral junk that ad-driven business models incentivize.But there is room for it to go wrong, so it would have to be designed carefully. For example it's still vulnerable to the same rage-bait incentive that ad-driven services are, where people decide that articles that make them angry or afraid, or which make their ideological opponents look evil, are more worth spreading (and therefore more worthy of paying to unlock for the crowds).There's probably no perfect defence against this, but there's at least one option where  the kickstarter contract can be structured so that the payments get returned if the article is later found to be factually incorrect in some major aspect. Then at least there's a pull towards truth, even if it's still rage-inducing.Of course, this model also incentivizes the writing of articles that groups with more buying power are more likely to want to spread, so the wealthier blocs will shape the narrative... but when has the world ever been otherwise.reply",

On the other hand, the occasional widely-shared guest link may bring a few more subscribers, but I doubt this scales.reply",

I use a service that provides access to a bunch of different LLMs. Each time I call an LLM I, in effect, pay a $0.001 - $0.05 for the response. (Technically, this is implemented as me having to renew earlier.) Each time I make a call, I don't know if the answer will be useful. I don't even know how much it will cost!

      "Singapore's economic policies are complicated and often misdirecting. I'll break down the misconceptions.The primary purpose of CPF is not a pension scheme. It is structured as a massive forced bond purchase scheme by citizens. Financially what happens is the 37% of citizen income buys a long term bond (till retirement age, on average decades) at rock bottom interest rates (it's pegged to the overnight rate or a minimum of 2.6%). The returns are specifically decoupled from the real long term returns. This has historical roots in the government needing vast capital financing. They make enormous amounts of the delta between the short term interest rate and long term capital gains. Singapore has no oil or natural resources, but it's sovereign wealth fund has AUM in the regions of countries like Norway which do for this reason. It is not a shock absorber like the article suggests. The withdrawal terms are strict - housing, a significant medical expense and retirement are the only real ways to get money out of it.\"Trying to keep people employed\" is a goal, not a policy. In fact the Singapore government maintains a large worker supply through immigration. The foreign worker population, ~30%. The main goal of the government is to maximize the absolute number of people working.The reason it raising the retirement age is effective in workforce participation is because most people have no choice. Retirement only pays out after the age. The working life of an average Singaporean has seen 37% gone to CPF, maybe another 10% to income taxes, another 5% to GST, road tax, property tax, etc. After all this there's the astronomical cost of living. This is also intentional, to raise the number of employees.reply",
      "Like Dubai, many of the migrant workers are ineligible for post retirement life in Singapore and so despite any mandatory savings will not represent any kind of burden on the state compared to delivery of health and housing and care costs.So they are functionally productive and net positive to any scheme about post work funding for the community.reply",
      "This is being entirely disingenuous and is completely different to what goes on in Dubai.I have lived there and can rattle off plenty of criticisms about the country but complaining about migrant workers who clamour to work in SG is not one of them.The vast majority of Singapore migrant workforce are Malaysian citizens who live over the border in JB, you can rent a 2 bed apartment there for $300 a month and eat out in a restaurant for $2 while commuting each day to a developed country and earn those level of wages.To pretend these people have a rough deal compared to back home is absurd and I'd challenge anyone to actually talk to them first before getting on your high horse. Ask them if they would prefer to work in their home country.reply",
      "I said nothing of the kind you imply. I know skilled workers who were based in Dubai but who expected to leave immediately their work (court transcription) ended and the same with expat Australians and Britons working in Singapore.The point is not if they get a rough deal or not compared to their home income. The point is that the welfare state costs on the tax base won't be spent to their material benefit, so they are not a cost on the state after working lifetime. Forced saving schemes be they state pension, annuity or superannuation are savings which act as investment capital and i am sure sematek and other bodies leverage this, and then in income phase return to the holder but they are not equal to the lifetime cost of care for the elderly, or provision of housing.Dubai has much more extreme exploitation of low wage migrant labour, not that none of the workforce in Singapore is remittance labour, filipina nannies and the like but I'm not actually talking about construction site labour or the Dubai passport hijack thing.reply",

I have not heard of them being successfully trained, but then, it's never really been a subject I studied.Also, as we are learning, more and more, when it comes to war, big is not necessarily better. Big targets. These days, a speedboat with a missile, could take out an aircraft carrier.reply",
      "There's some debate over the type of elephant Hannibal's forces used.  They were likely not the African elephants we know today, but North African elephants[1].  This was a physically smaller subspecies that was later extirpated by the Romans. Perhaps analysis of the bone in this story will help settle the debate.It's also worth noting that, despite the insane effort it must have taken to get elephants over the alps, all but one of Hannibal's elephants died during the first winter in Italy.  They made for a great story and were a propaganda coup for the Carthaginians, but didn't wind up making much of a military impact.  They were only present for the first couple of battles Hannibal fought.[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_elephantreply",

And the more I read, the more bizarre coincidences kept piling up - from Daggorath on the Coco, a computer maybe 1/100th as popular as the Commodores and Ataris, to knowing how to beat a Joust arcade cabinet with the arcane pterodactyl bug which was only present in Red/Yellow Joust cabinets.reply",

Here's what I currently have:Project-based organization -- Group sessions by working directory with a visual icon strip sidebar.Multiple session types -- Claude Code sessions, standalone terminal shells, and embedded browser tabs.Session persistence -- Terminal output is logged and replayed on relaunch so you never lose context.Session resume -- Claude Code sessions detect their session ID automatically and resume where you left off.Planning mode -- Draft and refine plans in a built-in text editor, then send them to Claude with one click.Planning templates -- Start plans from structured templates for bug reports, feature requests, code reviews, refactors, and more.Auto-titling -- Generic session names are replaced with descriptive titles generated by Claude after the first exchange.Theming -- Light and dark themes with full CSS variable control.Native menus and keyboard shortcuts -- macOS-native menu bar with comprehensive shortcut coverage.Resizable layout -- Adjustable sessions sidebar width with state persistence across restarts.Dock badge -- macOS dock icon shows the number of actively working Claude sessions.Pin and archive -- Pin important sessions to the top or archive completed ones to keep the list clean.Session card view -- See all sessions in a sortable grid with activity stats, token counts, and quick actions.File tracker -- See which files Claude creates, modifies, and deletes in a live sidebar panel.Macros -- One-click buttons for frequently used commands like /clear or commit this work.Remote mode -- Monitor and control sessions from your phone via an encrypted WebSocket relay.It has become my development hub where I can iterate very quickly.reply",

      "Based on the code that it's good at, and the code that it's terrible at, you are exactly right about LLMs being shaped by their training material. If this is a fundamental limitation I really don't see general purpose LLMs progressing beyond their current status is idiot savants. They are confident in the face of not knowing what they don't know.Your experience with Arabic in particular makes me think there's still a lot of training material to be mined in languages other than English. I suspect the reason that Arabic sounds 20 years ago is that there's a data labeling bottleneck in using foreign language material.reply",
      "Humans are also shaped by the training material\u2026 maybe all intelligence is.Talk to people with extreme views and you realize they are actually rational, but the world they live in is not normal or typical. When you apply perfectly sound logic to a deformed foundation, the output is deformed. Even schizophrenic people are rational\u2026 Logic is never the problem, it\u2019s always the training material.Anyway that\u2019s why we had to build a mathematical field of statistics and create tools like sample sizes and distributions to generalize.reply",
      "I've had a suspicion for a bit that, since a large portion of the Internet is English and Chinese, that any other languages would have a much larger ratio of training material come from books.I wouldn't be surprised if Arabic in particular had this issue and if Arabic also had a disproportionate amount of religious text as source material.I bet you'd see something similar with Hebrew.reply",
      "I think therein lies another fun benchmark to show that LLM don't generalize: ask the llm to solve the same logic riddle, only in different languages. If it can solve it in some languages, but not in others, it's a strong argument for just straightforward memorization and next token prediction vs true generalization capabilities.reply",
      "I would expect that the \"classics\" have all been thoroughly discussed on the Internet in all major languages by now. But if you could re-train a model from scratch and control its input, there are probably many theories you could test about the model's ability to connect bits of insight together.reply",
      "I usually use English to talk to Gemini, but the other day I wanted to try and find out the original band of a Siberian punk song that I have carried around in my music collection since time immemorial. Problem is the tags are all over the place in this genre and there are situations where \"Foo-Bar\" and \"Foobar\" are two completely different bands. Gemini was clearly trained on some genre forums from late 90s which are... shall I say non-PC by any stretch of the term.In the middle of the conversation it randomly switched from English to Russian and clearly struggled to maintain the tone imposed by the built-in prompt.reply",
      "> whether AI can push to radicalize susceptible individualsMy guess is, not as the single and most prominent factor. Pauperisation, isolation of individual and blatant lake of homogeneous access to justice, health services and other basic of social net safety are far more likely going to weight significantly. Of course any tool that can help with mass propaganda will possibly worsen the likeliness to reach people in weakened situation which are more receptive to radicalization.reply",
      "There's actually been fascinating discoveries on this. Post the mid 2010 ISIS attacks driven by social media radicalization in Western countries, the big social platforms (Meta, Google, etc) agreed to censor extremist islamist content - anything that promoted hate, violence, etc. By all accounts it worked very well, and homegrown terrorism plummeted. Access and platforms can really help promote radicalism and violence if not checked.reply",

      "Excellent science communication, as would be expected from this author.A recent finding from last year looked at the mutational signatures in colon cancer in those under 50:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8The different processes that damage DNA have sequence preferences for the direct change in the DNA (e.g. G-->C versus G-->T), as well as the sequence around the damage. Smoking causes very very different signatures of DNA damage than, say, damage from UV from being in the sun.So every cell in our body carries with it a (noisy) history of the mutagenic processes it has been exposed to.This paper found some differences in these mutational signatures of later colon cancers, and attributed them to colibactin, a mutagen produced by bacteria.It remains to be seen what percentage of the increase in under-50 colon cancers this would explain, but it's an additional risk factor that didn't make it onto the chart, likely because it's not coming from standard epidemiological analysis, and instead from the world of molecular analysis.reply",

It seems like repeated bouts of lower blood for the intestine on long runs has a cumulative impact and damages the colon even if it doesn't cause ischemic colitis.reply",

An alternative theory is diet, which is also the leading theory for increasing incidences in non-athletes.
