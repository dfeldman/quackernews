      "This is the type of thing that'd normally show up on CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report which has been published weekly since 1960 (my understanding is this is without fail).But unfortunately the current administration has decided an ideological purification is more important than keeping the American public apprised of threats to their health.So it wasn't published last week, and probably won't be this week either. \"Politics don't matter\" though ;) Bummer!https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/\n \nreply",

The Grand Canyon has a way of looking the same now as it did in 1955 and so those photos were discarded.

A PET plastic soda bottle (pepsi, coke) will flex in the body where it's thin, but not on the threads on the top of the bottle.  In fact, those are pretty strong, because they need to hold on a cap keeping carbonation in.A good question to ask is if the dovetail joint in plastic as strong as wood?

For general purpose workloads, having the E cores enabled (and therefore AVX-512 disabled) was faster. You had to have an extremely specific workload that didn't scale well with additional cores and also had hot loops that benefitted from AVX-512, which was not very common.So you're right: They never wanted people to use it. It wasn't advertised and wasn't usable without sacrificing all of the E cores and doing a lot of manual configuration work. I suspect they didn't want people using it because they never validated it.

      "This is excellent. Too often people guess at things when they could be more empirical about them. Ever since I learned the scientific method (I think 3rd or 4th grade) I was all about the 'let's design an experiment' :-).Let me state up front that I have no idea why Wayland would have this additional latency. That said, having been active in the computer community at the 'birth' of X11 (yes I'm that old) I can tell you that there was, especially early on, a constant whine about screen latency. Whether it was cursor response or xterm scrolling. When \"workstations\" became a thing, they sometimes had explicit display hardware for just the mouse because that would cut out the latency of rendering the mouse in the frame. (not to mention the infamous XOR patent[1])As a result of all this whinging, the code paths that were between keyboard/mouse input and their effect on the screen, were constantly being evaluated for ways to \"speed them up and reduce latency.\" Wayland, being something relatively \"new\" compared to X11, has not had this level of scrutiny for as long. I'm looking forward to folks fixing it though.[1] https://patents.google.com/patent/US4197590\n \nreply",
      "Display devices (usually part of your GPU) still have \"explicit display hardware just for the mouse\" in form of cursor planes. Later this has been generalized as overlay planes.Planes can be updated and repositioned without redrawing the rest of the screen (the regular screen image is on the primary plane), so moving the cursor is just a case of committing the new plane position.The input latency introduced by GNOME's Mutter (the Wayland server used here) is likely simply a matter of their input sampling and commit timing strategy. Different servers have different strategies and priorities there, which can be good and bad.Wayland, which is a protocol, is not involved in the process of positioning regular cursors, so this is entirely display server internals and optimization. What happens on the protocol level is allowing clients to set the cursor image, and telling clients where the cursor is.\n \nreply",
      "Protocols can bake in unfortunate performance implications simply by virtue of defining an interface that doesn't fit the shape needed for good performance. Furthermore, this tends to happen \"by default\" unless there is a strong voice for performance in the design process.Hopefully this general concern doesn't apply to Wayland and the \"shape\" you have described doesn't sound bad, but the devil is in the details.\n \nreply",
      "I don't think the Wayland protocol is actually involved in this. Wayland describes how clients communicate with the compositor. Neither the cursor, nor the mouse are a client, so no where in the path between moving the mouse and the cursor moving on screen is Wayland actually involved.The story is different for applications like games that hide the system cursor to display their own. In those cases, the client needs to receive mouse events from the compositor, then redraw the surface appropriately, all of which does go through Wayland.\n \nreply",
      "According to Asahi Lina, X does async ioctl that can update the cursor even during the scanout of the current frame, while Wayland does atomic, synced updates on everything, cursor involved, which has the benefit of no tearing and the cursor's state is always in sync with the content, but it does add an average of 1 more frame latency (either updates just in time for the next frame), or it will go to the next frame.\n \nreply",
      "This is not what Wayland does, it is what a particular display server with Wayland support decided to do.Second, just to be clear, this only discusses mouse cursors on the desktop - not the content of windows, and in particular not games even if they have cursors. Just the white cursor you browse the Web with.Anyway, what you refer to is the legacy drm interface that was replaced by the atomic one. The legacy interface is very broken  and does not expose new hardware features, but it did indeed handle cursors as its own magical entity.The atomic API does support tearing updates, but cursor updates are currently rejected in that path as drivers are not ready for that, and at the same time, current consensus is that tearing is toggled on when a particular fullscreen game demands it, and games composite any cursors in their own render pass so they're unaffected. Drivers will probably support this eventually, but it's not meant to be a general solution.The legacy API could let some hardware swap the cursor position mid-scanout, possibly tearing the cursor, but just because the call is made mid-scanout does not mean that the driver or hardware would do it.> but it does add an average of 1 more frame latencyIf you commit just in time (display servers aim to commit as late as possible), then the delay between the commit and a tearing update made just before the pixels were pushed is dependent on the cursor position - if the cursor is at the first line shown, it makes no difference, if on the last shown, it'll be almost a frame newer.Averaging cursor positions mean half a frame of extra latency, but with a steady sampling rate instead of rolling shutter.Proper commit timing is usually the proper solution, and more importantly helps every other aspect of content delivery as well.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, Wayland isn't designed in such a way that would require any additional latency on cursor updates. The Wayland protocols almost entirely regard how applications talk to the compositor, and don't really specify how the compositor handles input or output directly. So the pipeline from mouse input coming from evdev devices and then eventually going to DRM planes doesn't actually involve Wayland.\n \nreply",
      "Software works best when the developers take responsibility for solving user's problems.> Wayland, which is a protocolThis is wayland's biggest weakness.  The effect is diffusion of responsibility.\n \nreply",
      "You're kind of getting tripped up on terminology. The OP didn't measure Wayland; they measured GNOME Shell which does take responsibility for its performance. Also, I'm not aware of any latency-related mistakes in Wayland/Weston (given its goal of tear-free compositing).\n \nreply",

Correct me if I'm wrong, but, I don't think you can actually open files in this app, right?

      "At work we are using Metacontroller to implement our \"operators\". Quoted because these are not real operators but rather Metacontroller plugins, written in Python. All the watch and update logic - plus the resource caching - is outsourced to Metacontroller (which is written in Go). We define - via its CompositeController or DecoratorController CRDs - what kind of resources it should watch and which web service it should call into when it detects a change. The web service speaks plain HTTP (or HTTPS if you want).In case of a CompositeController, the web service gets the created/updated/deleted parent resource and any already existing child resources (initially none). The web service then analyzes the parent and existing children, then responds with the list of child resources whose existence and state Metacontroller should ensure in the cluster. If something is left out from the response compared to a previous response, it is deleted.Things we implemented using this pattern:- Project: declarative description of a company project, child resources include a namespace, service account, IAM role, SMB/S3/FSX PVs and PVCs generated for project volumes (defined under spec.volumes in the Project CR), ingresses for a set of standard apps- Job: high-level description of a DAG of containers, the web service works as a compiler which translates this high-level description into an Argo Workflow (this will be the child)- Container: defines a dev container, expands into a pod running an sshd and a Contour HTTPProxy (TCP proxy) which forwards TLS-wrapped SSH traffic to the sshd service- KeycloakClient: here the web service is not pure - it talks to the Keycloak Admin REST API and creates/updates a client in Keycloak whose parameters are given by the CRD specSo far this works pretty well and makes writing controllers a breeze - at least compared to the standard kubebuilder approach.https://metacontroller.github.io/metacontroller/intro.html\n \nreply",
