      "If you read the article, it explains exactly how the technique works.One of the many ways CSS allows you to customize formatting is to change the background style of elements. In addition to just using a solid color or image, you can specify a procedural gradient. And by superimposing several such gradients, you can make a very blurry approximation of an image.CSS also includes a basic expression language which allows evaluating simple arithmetic expressions. So you can encode all the blurred image's parameters as a packed integer in a single compact CSS property per image, and use rules to define the gradients in terms of that integer.Note that CSS is not used to compute the blurred image representation itself -- you have to do that separately. (Even if you could do it in pure CSS, the whole point is to show a blurred preview image before the image itself is downloaded to the browser, so doing it in CSS would defeat the purpose.)\n \nreply"

I have one with the ball with the ball under the thumb instead of the middle like this one has though.It works not just for light gaming, but also \"heavy\" gaming, like shooters. Just move your thumb instead of your whole arm. Works perfectly well.And that's not even mentioning how relaxing it is. You can put the trackball anywhere.

      "The business world changes direction faster than companies can adapt.  That was my biggest lesson as an entrepreneur: entrepreneurs don't really pivot into product-market fit, the market pivots into them.  The reason capitalism works is because there's this huge sea of dream-chasers out there, most of whom will go bankrupt, so that when the market's needs change there is somebody out there to service them, and everybody who's not effectively servicing them goes to hell and gets another job.Corporations and management basically exist to buffer this uncertainty.  Employment is actually a really bad deal in good economic times; owners reap almost all the windfall of having a successful product.  But in bad times, the company keeps paying you even if they're losing money, at least up until they don't.  You get a raw deal, but not as raw a deal as the people paying you.Likewise with strategic direction.  The market's needs change faster than senior executives can adapt: if they always produced what the market was actually clamoring for, the company would run around like a chicken with its head cut off (this actually happens when the CEO panics, and a key CEO skill, and part of the reason they're paid so much, is the ability to ignore every piece of market data saying \"You're not hot anymore.  Nobody wants you, and the market has moved on\" and keep doing what you're doing even though your intuition is telling you that you're doomed and going to lose your cushy $20M/year job).  Much of the job of middle management is to buffer senior management's freakouts and tell the ICs \"Keep calm and carry on; let's see if he still cares about this new hotness next week.\"\n \nreply",

      "> I assume that Meta has a backdoor into WhatsApp conversationsThey don't need a back door when they control the front door: the app. End-to-end encryption doesn't protect the endpoints.(In other words, your concern is warranted.)\n \nreply",
      "You're absolutely right. End-to-end encryption protects message content, but WhatsApp still collects metadata, which is incredibly valuable.Even though they can't read your messages, they know who you talk to, how often, when, and for how long. They also track your device info, IP address (which can reveal your location), network details, and app usage patterns.And this data isn\u2019t just sitting there\u2014Meta uses it. For example, if you chat with a business on WhatsApp, you might start seeing ads for that business on Instagram or Facebook. They don\u2019t need to read your messages when they can infer so much just from how you use the app.Disclaimer: Comment translated from Spanish and corrected by Chat GPT.\n \nreply",

      "If anyone here hasn't read Borges, I'd strongly recommend him. Pretty much everything he wrote was short, <20 pages, and so it's really easy to sit down and read one of his stories over a lunch break. The common recommendation would be to try out Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius and see if you like it. If so, it's part of Labyrinths, which is (in my opinion) his best collection of short stories. The best edition in English is probably Penguin's Collected Fictions.Regarding the content of this interview:>If you compiled an enormous dataset of everything Borges read, and combined it with an exquisitely sensitive record of every sensory experience he ever had, could you create a Borges LLM?This is my Kantian way of thinking about epistemology, but I don't think that LLMs can create synthetic a priori knowledge. Such knowledge would be necessary to create Borges out of a world without Borges.In this interview, Simon's view feels much more like the way Hume viewed people as mechanical \"bundles of sensations\" rather than possessing a transcendent \"self\". This led to his philosophical skepticism, which was (and still is I guess) a philosophical dead end for a lot of people. I think such epistemological skepticism is accurate when applied to machines, at least until some way of creating synthetic a priori knowledge is established (Kant did so with categories for humans, what would the LLM version of this be?)\n \nreply",

      "I have been in the workforce for almost 30 years now and I believe that everybody is getting more squeezed so they don\u2019t have the time or energy to do a proper job. The expectation is to get it done as quickly as possible and not do more unless told so.In SW development in the 90s I had much more time for experimentation to figure things out. In the last years you often have some manager where you basically have to justify every thing you do and always a huge pile of work that never gets smaller. So you just hurry through your tasks.I think google had it right for a while with their 20% time where people could do wanted to do. As far as I know that\u2019s over.People need some slack if you want to see good work. They aren\u2019t machines that can run constantly on 100% utilization.\n \nreply",
      ">  In the last years you often have some manager where you basically have to justify every thing you do and always a huge pile of work that never gets smaller. So you just hurry through your tasks.This has been my exact experience. Absolutely everything is tracked as a work item with estimates. Anything you think should be done needs to be justified and tracked the same way. If anything ever takes longer than the estimate that was invariably just pulled out of someones ass (because it's impossible to accurately estimate development unless you're already ~75% of the way through doing it, and even then it's a crapshoot) you need to justify that in a morning standup too.The end result of all of this is every project getting bogged down by being stuck on the first version of whatever architecture was thought up right at the beginning and there being piles of tech debt that never gets fixed because nobody who actually understands what needs to be done has the political capital to get past the aforementioned justification filter.\n \nreply",

      "This was previously recommended to me on HN, so I\u2019ll pass it along. The book \u201cSeeing Like A State\u201d gives a pretty reasonable explanation for why this happens: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_StateThe basic idea is that the only viable way to administer a complex and heterogenous system like a massive corporation is to simplify by enforcing \u201clegibility\u201d or homogeneity. Without this, central control becomes far too complex to manage. Thus, the simplification becomes a mandate, even at the cost of great inefficiencies.What makes the book particularly interesting is the many different historical examples of this phenomenon, across a wide array of human endeavors.\n \nreply",
      "The problem is that this miserable state of affairs works at scale.Yes, on problems that exist at the scale of one or  intelligent, educated, experienced, and dedicated human (or maybe up to 3-5), an individual or small team will run circles around a business. You can have a top-notch CEO and COO and HR manager and six program managers (each with zero domain experience other than running a Jira board) and four dozen junior consultants who memorized just enough to pass the interviews and an art department and sales and finance and IT. For some problems, that whole $50M enterprise will be utterly demolished by a couple of determined engineers.Likewise, a monarchy with a wise, benevolent, and just king can flourish, whereas a corrupted and bureaucratically entangled democracy is woefully inefficient.But if you want your kingdom to last more than two generations before succumbing to a greedy monarch, or want your enterprise to solve bigger problems that don't decompose nicely to small ones, to vertically integrate huge manufacturing systems and scale out to billions of units, the only method that works is the inefficient one.

      "The duration of these effects is particularly notable - the study found differences in male rats even 10+ weeks after the last ethanol exposure, suggesting potentially long-lasting effects that persist well into abstinence.\n \nreply",
      "(\u2026in mice)This is very interesting! As a layman, I was aware that men and women had different alcohol tolerances but had no idea that there were more crucial neurological differences.Could it because of differences in physiology? No:\u201cThe observed sex differences in DMS sensitivity to EtOH are unlikely to result from basic physiological properties of the recorded cells, since these properties are similar across sexes. While estrous cycle can influence female neural physiology, sampling across several weeks likely averaged out these cycle-dependent changes in the present study\u201d\n \nreply",
      "\"No difference in physiology\" ignores the general presence of a very different endocrine system.And, indeed, ethanol is an endocrine disruptor. The endocrine system, in turn, is known to influence neuroplasticity. Given that estrogen and testosterone impact neuroplasticity in the DMS via different pathways, there's a good chance that plays a role.As wild speculation, estrogen acts as an inhibitor for long-term potentiation (or strengthening of synaptic connections), which lends mild support to the idea that it could prevent changes in outcome-related encoding. (The paper points out a possible mechanism, as footnote 72. I admit I was too lazy to read it, so it might well say that this was a really bad theory.)In general, whenever something weird happens that has observable differences across sexes, blaming the endocrine system is a good first go-to strategy ;) Hormones are extremely powerful influences in our body.\n \nreply",

      "Anthropic has a definition:  Workflows are systems where  LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.\n  Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks\n\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-age...While I know it's a marketing term, I think a good distinction is that agents have a loop in the execution graph, and can choose whether to loop or keep going. Workflows are chained LLM calls where the LLM has no \"choice\".\n \nreply",
      "I should have read this 12h ago! This afternoon, I tried to create my first simple agent using LangChain. My aim was to repeatedly run a specific python analysis function and perform a binary search to find the optimal result, then compile the results into a markdown report and export it as a PDF.However, I now realize that most of these steps don't require AI at all, let alone agents. I wrote the full algorithm (including the binary search!) in natural language for the LLM. And although it sometimes worked, the model often misunderstood and produced random errors out of the blue.I now realize that this is not what agents are for. This problem didn't require any agentic behavior. It was just a fixed workflow, with one single AI step (generating a markdown report text).Oh well, nothing wrong with learning the hard way.\n \nreply",
      "> Workflows are systems where  LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code pathsThis definition keeps coming up, but the definition isn't accurate for workflows. Modern workflow systems are very dynamic in nature and direct their own process and tool usage (e.g. like Temporal, disclaimer: my employer). You can even write workflows that eval code if you want though for most that's a step of flexibility too far to give to an LLM. Many workflows have LLMs tell them what to do next, sometimes via a bounded tool list, or sometimes open ended e.g. process execution or code eval. There is no limit here. A better definition of a workflow is that it durably orchestrates things, not that the sequence or code is predefined.So by a more accepted/modern definition of \"workflow\", agents are workflows that just happen to be more dynamic than some more rigid workflows.\n \nreply",
      "But they muddle it by saying all of them are Agentic Systems\n \nreply",

      "the LLM does have the ability to send garbage output in protest\n \nreply",
      "The Big Bang is maximally agentic but has zero intelligence (it has maximal future potential intelligence though). Current definitions of agency are way too narrow and unphysical, so:Agency is time-like, energy-like, choosing, changing shapes or geometry of the world and the agent itself. It\u2019s GPU computations. Explosions have a lot of agency.Intelligence is space-like, matter-like, the static geometric shape like an LLM (it\u2019s basically a bunch of vectors). It\u2019s a file. The static final 4D spacetime of our universe has a lot of intelligence but zero agency, because it\u2019s static.Maximal intelligence+agency is the static spacetime of  multiverse (=max intelligence) which can change its shape in an instant (=max agency, shape-changing ability).Same way we have e=mc2, we have agency = intelligence * constant.\n \nreply",
      "> Our litmus test for AI agents: Does the AI system perform actions under its own identity?So service accounts are agents? This seems pretty thin.In AI an \"agent\" is simply any code/workflow/automation that utilizes an LLM to respond to broadly defined external/environmental stimuli and decide how to react given broadly defined motivations and/or objectives.Not agent: Document comes in -> If invoice return key-value pairs to make API call with.Agent: Document comes in -> You're a finance professional: decided what to do with this document. Here are the tools/actions available to you: X, Y, Z.Both use AI and can achieve the same thing, but one is \"agentic\", while the other is deterministic.\n \nreply",
      "It\u2019s a bit amusing that so much ink has been spilled over what the definition of an \u201cAI agent\u201d is.I don\u2019t care. I care what your software can do. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s called AI or machine learning or black magic. I care if it can accomplish a task reliably so that I don\u2019t have to do it myself or pay someone to do it.We had the same argument about 3 years ago when everyone started calling things \u201cAI\u201d. They use LLMs to generate text. Usually they have outsourced all of the interesting technical work to a handful of providers backed by big Web 2.0 companies.\n \nreply",

Or, even deeper, the definition of intelligence, gets debated again and again with all the goal post dragging one expects these days.Even breaking out simple categories can help likeType I agent: Script driven, uses LLM for intelligent actions.Type II agent: LLM driven, uses scripts and tools. May still need human input.Type III agent: Builds a time machine to kill John Connor.\n \nreply"
