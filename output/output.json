      "A lot of the guidelines that are used to light a scene for a camera are also quite useful for lighting a room for yourself, just with less light needed as the human eye has a much higher dynamic range than a camera sensor:* Use diffuse light. This usually means multiple light sources bouncing and diffusing light off surfaces (ceilings, walls, etc) or diffusers.* Minimize shadows. Shadows lead to contrast which can lead to eye strain. Use multiple, maybe directional, light sources to illuminate shadows.* Minimize highlights. Windows without blinds let in lots of light which leads to contrast and can lead to eye strain. Curtains and blinds are great ways to diffuse light.* Uniform color temperature. Try to make sure all your lights have the same color temperature. Small variations are okay but large color temperature variations lead to color contrast which also tends to be hard on eye strain.* Select your color temperature based on needs and feeling. A lot of people prefer warmer color temperature lights and cool temperature lights are known to be more stressful for folks with anxiety-related conditions, but if your work requires accurate color representation, or you find yourself mentally trying to compensate for color temperature, then change the temperature to what you find most productive yet relaxing.* Wall color. Remember that \"white\" light that reflects off colored surfaces will take on a hue similar to the reflected surfaces. Walls of different colors can cause challenges for uniform color temperature, and warm colored walls can take cold lights and turn them warm.A side effect, of course, is that your room will become a lot more photogenic. It's no coincidence since photogenic rooms are often just easiest on the eye to look at.\"Golden Hour\" is considered a great time for photogenic events, photographs, and videos. \"Golden Hour\" lighting tends to be diffuse, not too strong, and warm toned. Humans tend to really like this style of lighting and if you do too, you might want to recreate some of these properties in your office.\n \nreply",
      "In the history of LED lighting, it took quite a bit of work (hybrid phosphor technology, etc) to get them to emit warm color temperatures. The exact color temp can be a personal preference, but I think a lot of people aren't privy to the difference the color temperature of \"white\" light can make!I want to go on a guerrilla campaign around my neighborhood and replace porch light bulbs with warm equivalents.\n \nreply",

They recommend green lasers because they use the lowest power for the highest visibility at night.

Permanent blindness.\n \nreply",
      "I don't really get that impression. To the contrary: How dangerous blue light is supposed to be is commonly repeated, with many products for filtering it out, like glasses, and software in all devices that does the red shifting. Android has it by default, Linux does, macOS - is Windows missing? Or is there something in the implementation of those measures that you object to?But note that the wikipedia article you link states clearly that the eye strain attributed to blue light has no scientific evidence. That's also what I found out last time I looked into it - all those very strong statements about how dangerous blue light emission is supposed to be has no equivalent scientific studies that prove them. I think there was also a prominent article about that here on HN.I think the effect might be completely made up, as it is something that is easy to believe and to subjectively feel that it works, by a placebo effect basically.\n \nreply",

      "I'll chime in here as this is (very) related to my research.This instance of openly-registerable nameservers is just one (relatively rare) subset of a wide class of dangling DNS issues [1].Much more common is direct mapping of names to IP addresses on cloud providers that can be obtained by attackers [2][3]. Because of the scope and lack of global visibility that often comes with cloud services, an enterprise that uses is the cloud is very likely to have some vulnerabilitity like this under some subdomain.Unfortunately bug bounty programs often blanket exclude any form of \"subdomain takeover\" as a valid security threat, despite the fact that they're easily exploitable once discovered. We have internal (and public[4]) data showing all manner of sensitive information leaked as a result of this sort of configuration mismanagement.Ultimately, as others have observed, the current vulnerability disclosure landscape makes it far too easy for corporations to weasel out of acknowledging bona fide vulnerabilities, and of course ethical and legal expectations make it impossible for good-faith researchers to meet the bar of proof expected by these providers.To others' comments: yes, these vulnerabilities are trivially exploited to provision TLS certificates in practice, a risk that is unfortunately downplayed.[1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2976749.2978387\n[2] https://escholarship.org/content/qt9r59r676/qt9r59r676.pdf\n[3] https://pauley.me/post/2022/cloud-squatting/\n[4] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05122\n \nreply",
      "Beyond just IPs, there is a giant class of \"DNS record pointing to X shared cloud resource that organization no longer controls\" issues. The bigger the company, the more widespread the problem. These resource names get released back into a common pool that anyone can register.Think:* CNAME pointing to an S3 bucket, and the S3 bucket gets released* CNAME pointing to Azure Website/WebApp Instance* A record to an non-elastic IP, and the box gets rebooted* DNS name using a Route53 name server that no longer part of the org's AWS account* CNAME pointing to a Heroku/Shopify/GitHub pages account and the account gets deleted/deactivated freely up those names for registration* MX record pointing to old transaction email provider start up that dies, and someone else registers that domain name...Why does that happen?* Decentralization of IT means people spinning up infrastructure not knowing what they are doing* Great a spinning up infra, but when decomissioning they forget about DNS* Lots of subsidiaries, lots of brands, different groups, operating in different geographies. All this makes it difficult to discover and enforce proper policies* Geo-specific websites/apps (Think of all the country-specific websites Coke runs)* Using some 3rd party vendor and never telling security about it (Marketing spinning up some landing pages on some fly-by-night martech provider or wordpress host, and never turning them off)I am the Field CTO at a venture backed Israeli cyber security company in this space.

This is a weekly conversation\n \nreply",
      "What types of actions can you do to correct and prevent this class of errors? I think you could probably enforce  deployment and shutdown checklists, perhaps, or have automated DNS checking software to see if any of the issues exist (I bet you guys have a solution for that) but there are so many human-error problems in manufacturing, and I kinda consider the large-scale deployment of apps to have similar issues and failure modes on the human side.\n \nreply",
      "Azure has options when you use their DNS that they tie resource, Public IP, Azure WebApp and other to DNS. If resource is deleted, the record will be NXDomain. AWS probably has something for Route53.Otherwise, good IaC can help but even in larger companies, I see more ClickOps then I should.\n \nreply",
      "We have an inventory of everything running, and where they are supposed to be running. If service X does not respond on resource Y the team responsible get an ticket. Check is on IP and names, and some other services. There are no good ways to do this other than being meticulous IMHO. Getting dumps of what is running where from all services is rather hard but more or less doable.It helps not using the cloud.\n \nreply",
      "The simplest things you can do are either:- Stay within the cloud provider's ecosystem as much as possible, including for domain registration and DNS. All records then should be pointing to resources that include your account id in them and can't be taken over by others. If you delete the entire account, there'd be nothing to take over.- Do everything with Infrastructure as Code, including DNS. If a single \"terraform apply\" creates everything, then a single \"terraform destroy\" deletes it all, leaving nothing dangling, provided of course that it is setup correctly and doesn't error out midway through a run.Otherwise, it's a matter of being thorough. Automate what you can, including creating and deleting resources, if not through a single cloud provider API or some standard IaC product, then roll your own software to do it, but have software do it. Regularly roll out and tear down entire test installations of full systems, including valid DNS records. When you intend for them to be gone, ensure they are really, truly gone.If you can't automate it, then yeah, checklists.It's one of those things that is simple but not easy. It takes an organization that respects the tedious and time-consuming nature of ops, plans for it, and doesn't push people to cut corners for the sake of speed when the first time trying to do something takes much longer than someone's uninformed first guesstimate.Really, automate. At a small enough scale, it doesn't matter, but if you're Mastercard doing this kind of thing thousands of times over the course of decades, humans will inevitably make mistakes. Software will make mistakes, too, but at least when you test software, it will do the same thing every time it is tested. Humans do not provide that guarantee, even if they have checklists.Edit: Note the above is not true for LLMs, so when I say use software, I mean classical deterministic software. Don't have AI do it for you, because LLMs can and will produce different responses every time you make the same request. Don't devolve to making software that is just as flaky as humans.\n \nreply",

      "Recently I had to get a panoramic dental x-ray and I was making small talk with the person who was running the machine.I joked that I'm always cautious about machines like this, even knowing the dosage of radiation is low, simply because of the history of software safety controls and the story of Therac-25. She hadn't heard of it before and I gave her the gist of it, that an issue with the programming made it so it was possible to accidentally dose a patient considerably more than the intended amount (in a few different ways). It was interesting to her but I then had to pause so she could run the machine. I shut up and she did her thing.Then, after a few minutes of scanning, she sucked her teeth a bit and apologized, saying she needed to run it once more. No worries, let's get it done! She starts it again and as I'm getting scanned she explains that \"for whatever reason I was getting an error so I just had to restart it, this happens sometimes and I'm not really sure why.\" I give a little half-nervous chuckle and then the scan completes. Once I pull my head out of the machine, I finally get to finish my lovely Therac-25 story wherein I explain that one of the issues was... a combination of non-descriptive error codes, insufficient failsafes, and operator error resulting in patient casualties as the procedure was restarted one or more times.We shared a little laugh and discussed other things, cost of living primarily. I'm still alive so I'm at least 63% sure I didn't get megadosed or anything but its been a funny conversation to revisit now and then.\n \nreply",

The Therac-25 was involved in at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, in which some patients were given massive overdoses of radiation. Because of concurrent programming errors (also known as race conditions), it sometimes gave its patients radiation doses that were hundreds of times greater than normal, resulting in death or serious injury. These accidents highlighted the dangers of software control of safety-critical systems.\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25\n \nreply",
      "You're missing one critical aspect of this nightmare. After an incident:\"The AECL responded in two pages detailing the reasons why radiation overdose was impossible on the Therac-25, stating both machine failure and operator error were not possible.\"\n \nreply",
      "Leveson's fantastic Therac-25 paper is probably the most important document in the formative years of my young sweng career.I still re-read it every couple of years, and it's held up a lot better than one of my other early favorites, which was Feynman's appendix to the Challenger report. In the sense that I still draw new thoughts and realizations from it as I re-read it with additional experience in some of the engineering and organizational disciplines it touches.

Regardless of model, most modern APIs are implemented by mapping them in one way or another to the same HTTP protocol. It has also become common for RPC API designs to adopt one or two ideas from HTTP while staying within the RPC model, which has increased the range of choices that an API designer faces. This post tries to explain the choices, and give guidance on how to choose between them.gRPC is a technology for implementing RPC APIs that uses HTTP 2.0 as its underlying transport protocol. You might expect that gRPC and HTTP would be mutually exclusive, since they are based on opposite conceptual models. gRPC is based on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model, in which the addressable entities are procedures, and the data is hidden behind the procedures. HTTP works the inverse way. In HTTP, the addressable entities are \u201cdata entities\u201d (calle"

      "A classic essay whose significance goes way beyond women or feminism.  I've been part of a few \"structureless\" groups which spontaneously organized around an opportunity and were initially effective because of that structureless (e.g. somebody gets an idea,  the whole group moves like a military unit, opponents had no idea something like that could happen) but succumbed to the dynamics in that article on a time scale of three weeks (arguably ended a public company in that time!) to three years.\n \nreply",
      "There was and is a whole literature about unstructured and less-structured and alternatively-structured organisations; it even used to get a fair amount of coverage in mainstream news publications. But some time shortly after the year 2000 someone rang a bell, and now the only way to discuss the subject is to reshare \"The Tyranny of Structurelessness\" (which to be clear, is very good) every so often. (EDIT: And to re-emphasise, I'm not criticising yamrzou for sharing it!) Pasting one of my earlier comments on one of the earlier reposts:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36292289> This is really a good essay and surely deserves a high profile, but it's disappointing that it, and some bits of angst about Valve's internal situation, seem to be the only discussions of organisational structure that get widely shared these days. Back from about the '70s to the early '90s it seems that there was quite a lot of management-theory/theory-of-the-firm research into different organisational structures and how they affected innovation, ability to change and other desirable or undesirable characteristics of organisations. And it didn't just stay hidden in academia, as the results got a fair amount of coverage in newsmagazines and the like in the early '90s. (Which is how I heard about it: I'm no expert.) As you might expect, the findings on relatively \"structureless\" orgs seem to have been pretty compatible with Freeman's observations. But there was also research on many other unusual forms of structure and hierarchy, for example the \"matrix management\" which famously got implemented at Dow Chemical in the 1970s https://hbr.org/1978/05/problems-of-matrix-organizations .> But for some reason interest and attention seems to have completely faded out, at least at the popular level, by about 2000 or so. So the Valve situation gets reported on as if it's some kind of unprecedented novelty, and not an example of a sort of situation whose outcomes had been hashed out pretty thoroughly a decade or more earlier.\n \nreply",
      "Management theory, at least the aspects of it which become popular, seems fad-driven.Matrix managment, holacracy, consensus, etc etc.Is this a field where people discover things that last? For instance, fundamental limits to human communication, fundamental quantities that are conserved no matter what the configuration of management is.Computer science has Brooks' observations on team size and communication, but that was only ever a guess, it's not really a law.Generally people seem to adopt decision and management mechanisms that purport to address the pain they were having in their previous organization, while being proven enough to be plausible (\"$FAMOUS_COMPANY does it\") and not quantifiable enough to be a definite failure yet. Probably someone is writing a new airport book on \"Founder Mode\" right now!So... what is known about human management?

      "The bookhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zoneis of interest.  In my mind the most interesting application of that was the contemporaneous Falun Gong movement in China.Falun Gong practitioners would show up at a park and practice a set of simple physical and spiritual practices;  the organization was deliberately structureless because organizations of all kinds in China are required to admit a cadre of Communist Party members to surveil and control the organization.  No organization = no control network.  (The very act of gathering a group of people at a point, however, is a basic practice of military science)The one bit of authority in the organization is a book which is said to be infallible,  which defends them from having the book rewritten by the authorities.  (We know pretty well how the Communists and Republican governments oppressed folk religion movements such as the Huxian cult,  but Taoism in its established form has always been some selection of folk practices which are approved by the authorities as long as China has had governments)An unfortunate consequence of this is that Falun Gong cannot change any doctrine,  such as their belief that \"being gay is bad for your gong.\"  They lost the support of mainstream western organizations and descended into pandering to right-wing nuts to get what support they could.\n \nreply",

Ergo traditional structures were right all along.  No need to think about it.  That feminist/left-wing stuff is just naive kids.\n \nreply",
      "It wasn't just that era,  but the second wave of feminism was coming on strong then and there was a lot of writing about that movement then.I think a right-wing movement is more comfortable with the idea of social hierarchy,  whether it is a formally structured group where \"he who pays the piper pays the tune\" [1] or the kind of group that the article describes where there are people who run the group without formal authority.  There have been \"left-wing\" groups that have a strong hierarchy,  such as Lenin's Bolsheviks,  but groups like that have limited appeal to most people by the 1960s [2] [3].  There are also the various membership-based groups such as the Sierra Club and NOW which have limited effectiveness because they aren't accountable to members [4]So conflicts like the above vex leftists because they'd like to put their egalitarian values to work.My \"3 year\" case study was the time I was a leader in the Tompkins County Green Party.  After the 2000 Ralph Nader campaign we had a lot of energy and decided we wanted to build an organization to contest local elections.  We had luck early on taking advantage of fusion voting [5] to decisively settle a power struggle within the local Democratic party so people perceived we had power.There were about 50 people who turned up to meetings,  but 3 or 4 people had the time and energy to do the work,  I don't think we formed a clique,  we would have accepted just about anyone who was basically aligned with us and willing to put in the work.  I ran a web site and plastered the town with posters and mostly did as I pleased except for the few times somebody said \"you went too far with that poster\",  that is,  most of the members were basically deferential to the people who did the work.As time went on though the issue of being a spoiler [6] came up over and over again.  We got a famous green thinker who was shortlisted for the 2004 Presidential race by the national party [7] to run for mayor,  but people in our own party were afraid \"if we run Glover,  the cop is going to win\".  Each time we the prospect of running a candidate happened the group would split in half and by the 2004 race we couldn't really go forward because locally, statewide, and nationally we couldn't make up our mind if we even wanted to run a candidate.  My strongly held opinion was \"Fuck 'em\" when it came to the Democrats and that a political party that didn't run candidates had no reason to exist;  but I couldn't force that opinion on people that I felt a representative of and the other leaders felt the same way so we folded the organization up.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_network[2] https://genius.com/The-beatles-revolution-lyrics[3] A Leninist would say you're a poseur if you aren't part of an organization with the resolve and discipline to smash the capitalist class and the state the supports it.[4] A case study in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty[5] https://ballotpedia.org/Fusion_voting[6] https://www.brookings.edu/articles/reflections-on-the-2000-u...[7] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Glover_(activist)\n \nreply",

      "I teach the introduction to computing class at MSU and agree entirely: most students need to start with the absolutely most simple introduction to computing possible.My favorite two models are:The Scott CPUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNN_tTXABUA (great book, website is now offline unfortunately: https://web.archive.org/web/20240430093449/https://www.butho...)An extremely simple non-pipelined 8 bit CPU.  The emulator lets you step through tick by tick and see how the machine code is driving an operation.  I spend one lecture showing each tick of a bitwise AND and following the data around from the instruction into the instruction register, how the instruction selects the general purpose registers, runs it through the ALU and then moves the data back from the accumulator into a register.  It's one of my favorite lectures of the year.The Little Man Computer - https://www.101computing.net/LMC/A higher level Von Neumann style computer that helps introduce students gently to assembly where they can fully understand the \"machine code\" since it's just decimal.  We then build an emulator, assembler and compiler for an extension to LMC that introduces the notion of a stack to support function calls.It's a fun one semester class, not as intense as NAND-to-Tetris but still an overview of how computing works.\n \nreply",

      "very cool machine!\n \nreply",
      "My first introduction to this stuff was also the little man computer. I won't say when as it might make some readers feel old, but very fond memories of playing around with it.Similarly fond memories of the teacher letting me just do my own thing at the back of the classroom after noticing I was writing an interpreter rather than hard-coding all the logic in the task.Probably hard to state just how good of an introduction he was to programming, actually. Not a codeforces-style geek but was constantly drilling the value of writing beautiful code that is as simple as possible to a bunch of 14 year olds of which probably only me and a friend were listening. Maybe it's not coincidence that amongst my friends/mutuals from that age there are core maintainers for I think three for pretty big languages\n \nreply",

I've heard that Chinese universities sometimes have explicit publication quotas or offer cash bonuses for publications.  Having never worked at a university in China, I cannot personally verify that though.MDPI also spams anyone it thinks might be willing to submit a paper or serve as an editor, and does not seem to care much about the quality of the submissions it receives.\n \nreply",
      "Publication metrics.  This has been a problem for at least the last few decades, especially when it comes to papers from some parts of the world.  Before the current breed of low quality journals, we saw this happening with conferences that were often branded with professional societies like IEEE, but if you looked carefully it would be \u201cIEEE Section of (random place in Asia)\u201d and not a conference sanctioned by IEEE itself.  Those used to be full of garbage plagiarized papers and junk.  I think the idea is that nobody usually reads the papers when they make a decision based on publication metrics, so pumping a CV with garbage often goes unnoticed.  It\u2019s not a wise practice: in many places getting caught doing this would be a career ender.\n \nreply",

In a recent Open Letter, a group of sleuths drew attention to an example in Scientific Reports, published by Springer Nature. After the Open Letter was published, the paper that instigated our concern was promptly retracted by the journal, but as far as I can tell, not much else has changed.  The point about a paper like this is that it is so blatantly bad that it cannot have been through any kind of serious editorial scrutiny or peer review.
