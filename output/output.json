      "> We aimed to assess the relationship of objectively measured sleep regularity with risk for all-cause mortality, and mortality from cardiometabolic causes and cancer, in a large cohort (N = 60 977) who wore accelerometer devices for 1 week.They look at one week of sleep data and then check mortality records about 10 to 15 years later. It's hard to argue a causative effect between one week of bad sleep and death potentially 10+ years out.Obviously there's an  implication that people with terrible sleep regularity in that one week snapshot had terrible sleep regularity chronically, which in turn had a causative effect on mortality, but we have to make a couple of deductive jumps to get to that conclusion. I'd really like to see the same study with longer term sleep data.\n \nreply",
      "> It's hard to argue a causative effect between one week of bad sleep and death potentially 10+ years out.Statistically\u2014absolutely, I agree with you, but controls and sample sizes can always be improved.Narratively\u2014it's also not difficult to see: \"gunk builds up in brain; gunk requires regular removal; sleep removes gunk; stable sleep removes gunk better than unstable sleep\"It's difficult to blame people for emotionally attaching more to the latter than the former.\n \nreply",

      "I wonder how this translates if the irregularity is by choice. I can certainly see why people working back to back night and day shifts, or otherwise frequently being at a sleep debt that was compensated for later, would die younger.But as a freelancer, my sleep schedule is more or less my own. I go to sleep when I'm tired and usually try to sleep as long as I want to. Sometimes that's 11pm-10am, sometimes 6am-11am. It can oscillate throughout the week, but I try to average 16 hours of sleep in any given 48 hour period.Maybe this is incredibly unhealthy, but I've believed for a long time that it's kept me younger and healthier than being forced into a sleep rhythm that isn't what my body wants.\n \nreply"

      "Putting concerns about future states aside, congrats to the Pixelmator team. I've been using the app for years and it's a really great piece of software, well designed and well built. It's always been incredible value for the price, especially given that it basically replaces Photoshop for a wide swath of the market without compromising on UX (which is a problem for other competitors) at a price point that's like 1-2 months of an Adobe subscription (I don't even know exactly what that costs any more because Pixelmator + parts of the Affinity suite got me out of their clutches).Adobe must not be stoked about this news. And I'll just keep my fingers crossed this all heads in a direction that's more Logic than Dark Sky.\n \nreply",
      "I suspect this move is due to behind the scenes Adobe / Apple relations souring over the years.Adobe used to be one of their biggest supporters and helped winning over users to the Mac platform.This has diverged significantly over the years, and I think Apple is looking at Adobe and their business model and realizing that it both lucrative for them to have software that fills into this market to round out their creative pro apps suite and that Adobe increasingly becoming aggressive with cost / licensing and tactics to extract revenue aren't good for their ecosystem.That's my working theory, at least.\n \nreply",
      "Creative software and macbooks are complement goods. i.e., demand for macbooks goes up when creative software gets cheaper, and vice versa.This is a case where mergers are expected to make prices go down. As opposed for substitute goods, like macbooks and dell laptops, where a merger would probably make prices go up.In both cases you have a prisoner's dilemma between vendors - with vendors producing substitute goods, the \"defect\" option is to lower your price. (This makes you more money, but costs the other vendor more money than you made.) For substitute goods, the \"defect\" option is to raise your price (this makes you more money, but costs the other vendor more money than you made.)So mergers of vendors of substitute goods are usually bad, and tend to be blocked, because once merged the companies can coordinate to raise prices. But of complement goods are usually good, and tend to not be blocked, because once merged the companies can coordinate to lower prices.All this to say that I think this move makes sense for apple regardless of whether their relationship with Adobe has soured.\n \nreply",
      "Are there any signs of this souring?During the PPC-Intel transition, Adobe compatibility was almost a running joke.  Along the lines of the infamous \"You can always count on [..] to do the right thing, after they have exhausted all the other possibilities] quote.I was surprised at how quickly Adobe adopted aarch - it didn't feel sour.\n \nreply",
      "My recollection is that Adobe was slow to migrate from 32-bit to 64-bit x86 because they were still dependent on many of the Carbon APIs (Mac OS 9 compatibility) and those APIs weren't carried over to 64-bit. They dragged their heels about transitioning to Cocoa (NeXT derived) APIs for their UI, and it showed.\n \nreply",
      "Not to mention Apple's challenge with 30% AppStore tax for subscription revenue.My guess was that Apple is okay with Apps from third parties that tithe 1/3 of their subscription revenue but aren't willing to make a place for them if they don't \"sing for their supper\" as my Grandfather used to say.\n \nreply",

      "> Apple\u2019s main source of innovation is applying mafia tactics to software distribution.Main source of innovation? What about the Mac, iMac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple watch, AirPods and M1 MacBook Air, all of which transformed their product categories?

      "I don't think so.

      "I haven't listened to this podcast yet so I don't know if this comes up, but a particularly scary part of running a custom OS on Apple Silicon machines is that the internal speakers temperature is regulated in software. The Asahi devs have had to painstakingly reverse engineer and reimplement the safety DSP that macOS uses on each device, and add some safety margin, because if they get it wrong they could literally destroy the speakers (and IIRC at least one of their own MacBooks did have its speakers sacrificed along the way).I wonder if there will be a similar issue with the displays when Asahi gets around to supporting HDR on machines equipped with FALD mini-LED backlights (or XDR, as Apple calls it). HDR displays usually regulate their brightness to keep the panel from getting too hot, and if Apple does that in software too then Asahi will need to replicate it.\n \nreply",
      "The fact that speaker temperature even needs to be considered is something that boggles the mind. I can't find any other references elsewhere on the Internet. Are you sure it's not DC blocking that they've cheaped out on somehow? It somewhat reminds me of this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7205759\n \nreply",
      "https://github.com/AsahiLinux/speakersafetyd#some-background...They do it because it lets them drive the speakers much louder than they could do safely with a simple power limiter. Apparently there are amplifier chips which can do that regulation internally but Apple decided to do it in software for whatever reason. Maybe they can squeeze out more sound quality with a more complex DSP that way, I doubt it's cost-cutting given their margins.\n \nreply",
      "It's probably a combo of cost-cutting and control. If you use a hardware chip, the chip itself only costs cents, but space is at a premium, and there assembly costs and reduced flexibility (you have to lock in your design well in advance).\n \nreply",
      "The control loop is handled by the OS? What if the (relatively complex and therefore much more likely to crash) OS crashes? Why would there not at least be some kind of basic thermal throttling implemented in hardware as a fallback? Oh wait, it's Apple, never mind.\n \nreply",
      "In the late 2000s I remember hearing of PC laptops which if left in the BIOS setup would overheat and shut down due to the fan control being exclusively done by OS drivers, so this sort of \"planned fragility\" isn't exclusive to Apple.\n \nreply",
      "It's managed by the Linux kernel communicating with a user space daemon (speakersafetyd). If the user land crashes or if the user space daemon is too slow the kernel can still fall back to a ridiculously low limit that will not damage the speakers for any audio. If the kernel crashes, well you get no audio in that case. IIRC the reason they couldn't do it completely in the kernel was because the temperature model uses floating point which is not allowed in the kernel.\n \nreply",
      "Reverse engineering the first bit of Apple's flagship M1 CPU, which was implemented in the original iPhone released back in '08, through an ARM-based architectural analysis, and integrating it into Linux kernel system calls is an extreme measure. This reduplication of the original dump, checking its hex value, then altering it to see if the application is functional. Doing x,y, and z, then seeing if it works inside VM hypervisor-space.https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024...\n \nreply",

      "Absolute best baked (what some people mistakenly call roast) potatoes I've ever had were in a small restaurant in Cornwall, England.They were almost definitely locally grown, doubtless extremely fresh, and almost definitely an heirloom variety. (And I acknowledge that food always tastes better when you're on holiday.)We were told the preparation was pretty simple:  'boil in a strong stock until almost fully cooked, then dry and coat in goose fat, and then bake until they look good'.(Apart from being much faster than conventional baked potatoes, and much much faster & safer than this rosin preparation, there's little risk of getting sick from this method.)\n \nreply",
      "In Britain, baked potatoes are oven-cooked whole, skin on, usually without fat; roast potatoes are peeled, cut into large uniform chunks (halved or quartered depending on the size), parboiled, then oven-cooked in lots of fat.\n \nreply",
      "That's how my mother used to do it, but I've found that you don't actually need to use \"lots of fat\" -- you can get good results with much less (just enough oil or goose fat to cover the bottom of the roasting tray), provided you toss the potatoes in it (pre-heated) when putting them in, and turn them a few times during cooking.The variety of potatoes used is also a critical factor.\n \nreply",
      "We toss the potatoes on the tray in just enough oil to lightly coat them. Don't boil them, just have them in the pre-heated oven for 30ish minutes.I prefer mealy potatoes, typically almond potatoes[1], but others work fine too.Add some herbs, salt and pepper while tossing.

      "Is anyone qualified to weigh in on the academic robustness of this?I only scanned a few bits but I was surprised to see statements like \"the male skeleton had a knee injury, thus conclusively proving it was Philip\" and \"the female skeleton was 18 therefore proving it was Cleopatra since sources say she was young\". (Paraphrasing) Etc etc. Is that all it takes to \"prove\" something? Could it not just be coincidence and it was someone else with a knee injury and some other ~18 year old? Or is that as far as we need to go in archeology to prove something? Put 2 and 2 together and come up with Cleopatra?There also seems to be some sort of almost personal/ad hominem type stuff later on about other researchers who apparently criticised the author's work which surprised me (\"Prag, Musgrave, and Neave continue to argue that I remain silent about Cyna ... as if it is an important issue\"...)Is this legit research?\n \nreply",
      "Apologies for the long response.I am only partially qualified in that I am not a professional archeologist, but I have done post-doctoral archeological studies and have read enough archeological studies to understand the larger academic context.It is not possible to present all the data informing a judgment in such a short work. Even in a book, it would not be possible. Thus it is common in archeology for papers to be written as part of an ongoing conversation / debate with the community - which would be defined as the small handful of other archeologists doing serious research on the same specific subject matter.Part of that context here is that these tombs are well-established to be the royal tombs of Alexander's family, spanning a few generations including his father and his son. This is one of the most heavily studied sites in Greece for obvious reasons, and that is not something anybody is trying to prove.In that context, his arguments are trying to identify any body as one among millions, but as one among a small handful of under ten possibilities.At the same time, the fact that he is not a native English speaker and general archeological style come into play. For example:\"the painter must have watched a Persian gazelle in Persia, since he painted it so naturalistically (contra Brecoulaki Citation2006). So the painter of Tomb II has to be Philoxenus of Eretria\" sounds like a massive leap, and it is. He continues:\"... Tomb I (Tomb of Persephone) must have been painted hastily by Nicomachus of Thebes (Andronikos Citation1984; Borza Citation1987; Brecoulaki et al. Citation2023, 100), who was a very fast painter (Saatsoglou-Paliadeli Citation2011, 286) and was famous for painting the Rape of Persephone (Pliny, N. H. 35.108\u2013109), perhaps that of Tomb I.\"Another huge leap, both 'presented as conclusions'. However he then continues to indicate these are just hypotheses: \"These hypotheses are consistent with the dates of the tombs...\"So his English language use of presenting things factually does not indicate certainty in the way the words would be used in everyday speech. He seems to perhaps misunderstand the force of the terms, but also appears to be working within the context of the conversation with other archeologists I mentioned to start: They all know every affirmation is as \"probably\", rarely anything more. So it is relatively common shorthand of the craft in that sense.I believe you are overthinking his responses to other authors, although I understand the culture shock. It is an ongoing conversation and archeologists tend to be blunt in their assessments. Add Greek bluntness on top of this, and it does not seem to matter to the material.As to your last question, is this legitimate research? The answer overall appears to be yes, although I could see several points (such as the identification of artists I quoted above, and various items I noticed), which I would never have put into ink the way he did. Still, most of his arguments are compelling. It is a shame that the aggressiveness of a few affirmations detract from the overall value of his work. Archeology is not code nor is it physics. It does not pursue universal truths that are more easy to verify through repeated experiments, but unique historical ones which necessarily attempt to interweave physical details and ancient historical records. Each field has its own level of certainty, and the fact that we cannot establish these details with the same certainty as we can establish the chemical formula for water does not make them useless, or pure inventions.

Born in Cricklewood, London, Sacks spent the better part of his 20s training to be a doctor, but came to feel that English academic medicine was stifling and stratified. A \u201ctight and tedious\u201d professional ladder, he thought, was the only one available to aspiring neurologists like him.A young queer man with a growing interest in motorcycle leather, Sacks had other reasons to leave. The revelation of his sexuality had caused a family rift: his mother felt it made him an \u201cabomination\u201d. And so he looked for escape across the Atlantic.

    "first_paragraph": "\n\nEthernet at NANOG 92\n\n\n\n\nOctober 2024\n\nEthernet has been the mainstay of much of the networking environment for almost 50 years now, but that doesn't mean that it's remained unchanged over that period. The evolution of this technology has featured continual increases in the scale of Ethernet networks, increasing in capacity, reach and connections. I\u2019d like to report on a couple of Ether-related presentations that took place at the recent NANOG 92 meeting, held in Toronto in October 2024 that described some recent developments in Ethernet.The original 1982 10Mbps Ethernet is a distant memory these days. A little over a decade later we saw a 100Mbs standard, and five years after that, in 1999, there was Gigabit Ethernet (1GbE). 10GbE followed after a further five years, and 100GbE in 2010. 400GbE was defined in 2017.Much of this has occurred by realising the potential from increasing gate density on silicon chips. Aggregate Switching capacity has increased by a factor of 16 in the past"

      "The authors factorize every weight matrix with an attention mechanism:  weight = attention(token_query, weight_keys, weight_values).\n\nIn other words, they query weight_keys to fetch the weight_values, and mix them to compute each weight on the spot.Increasing model size becomes a matter of adding more weight_keys and weight_values, and incrementally training them.Simple, clever, and it seems to work well. Beautiful.\n \nreply",
      "There is a particularly nice geometric interpretation of attention I just realised recently in a flash of enlightenment, best explained with an interactive Desmos plot (black dot is draggable):https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3rtqsyapxoThe above assumes the columns of K are normalised but bear with me. K and V together form a vector database. V are the payloads, each row containing a vector of data. K describes the position of these points in space, on the surface of a hypershpere. The query vector describes the query into the database: the vector direction describes the point in space that's being queried, the vector magnitude describes the radius of the query. The result is the weighted average of vectors from V, weighted by their distance from the query vector scaled by the query radius (which has a smooth Gaussian falloff). A recent paper from Nvidia I recommend, which derives a significant speedup by normalising vectors to a hypershpere: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01131v1\n \nreply",
      "It looks fascinating, but i don't understand it. I'm haven't gone yet deeply into the theory of attention networks.Can you explain the desmos plot in simple terms?\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, I believe this intuition first introduced by the Neural Turing Machine line-of-work and later simplified into AIAYN paper (NTM maintains \"external memory\" a.k.a. weight_keys, weight_values here).Disclaimer: these are from my memory, which can be wrong entirely.\n \nreply",
      "I believe there have been studies showing that the attention mechanism allows estimation of gradients for one-shot learning (i.e, based on what you tell the model you want in the input, it will use attention to 'update' the weights of the linear layers to 'learn' new information). This seems to be taking that one step further and just using attention for the weight estimations itself. The key insight here is that by adding more tokens to the weight estimation calculation, you can get more degrees of freedom.Total aside, but imagining how many levels of functions are present in the calculation of each activation here, and thinking about how regular old differentiation and gradient descent actually work to train these nested parameters, is truly amazing, in my opinion.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah. This thing is \"assembling a different transformer\" on the spot for each token.If one thinks about it for more than a moment, it's kind of incredible that it works.\n \nreply",
      "I think the same about regular neutral networks\n \nreply",
      "This is a great idea.  Being able to dynamically scale up model sizes as datasets and use cases expand without needing to retrain from scratch could enable a Cambrian explosion of interesting stuff building on top of a Llama type model trained in this way.\n \nreply",
      "I would like to see a comparison for the inference time compute between a regular transformer and this. I\u2019m assuming token/s is lower since you need to compute the weights of the model for each token prior to the actual attention calculations for the sequence position.\n \nreply",
      "Isn't that figure 5 in the paper? It's for training not inference, but presumably if training is faster then inference would be too. Because they don't increase the dimension of the text tokens when scaling up, which reduces the compute needed for attention. But potentially limits how well the text token attention can keep track of things, because it's got less space for passing things along.\n \nreply"
