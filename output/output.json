      "The real issue in modern data centers is TCP. Of course at present, we need to know about these little annoyances at the application layer, but what we really need is innovation in the data center at level 4. And yes I know that many people are looking into this and have been for years, but the economic motivation clearly has not yet been strong enough. But that may change if the public's appetite for LLM-based tooling causes data centers to increase 10x (which seems likely).",
      "I've fixed multiple latency issues due to nagle's multiple times in my career. It's the first thing I jump to. I feel like the logic behind it is sound, but it just doesn't work for some workloads. It should be something that an engineer needs to be forced to set while creating a socket, instead of letting the OS choose a default. I think that's the main issue. Not that it's a good / bad option but that there is a setting that people might not know about that manipulates how data is sent over the wire so aggressively.",
      "Same here. I have a hobby that on any RPC framework I encounter, I file a Github issue \"did you think of TCP_NODELAY or can this framework do only 20 calls per second?\".So far, it's found a bug every single time.Some examples: https://cloud-haskell.atlassian.net/browse/DP-108 or https://github.com/agentm/curryer/issues/3I disagree on the \"not a good / bad option\" though.It's a kernel-side heuristic for \"magically fixing\" badly behaved applications.As the article states, no sensible application does 1-byte network write() syscalls. Software that does that should be fixed.It makes sense only in the case when you are the kernel sysadmin and somehow cannot fix the software that runs on the machine, maybe for team-political reasons. I claim that's pretty rare.For all other cases, it makes sane software extra complicated: You need to explicitly opt-out of odd magic that makes poorly-written software have slightly more throughput, and that makes correctly-written software have huge, surprising latency.John Nagle says here and in linked threads that Delayed Acks are even worse. I agree. But the Send/Send/Receive receive pattern that Nagle's Algorithm degrades is a totally valid and common use case, including anything that does pipelined RPC over TCP.Both Delayed Acks and Nagle's Algorithm should be opt-in, in my opinion. It should be called TCP_DELAY, which you can opt-into if you can't be asked to implement basic userspace buffering.People shouldn't /need/ to know about these. Make the default case be the unsurprising one.",
      "The problem with making it opt in is that the point of the protocol was to fix apps that, while they perform fine for the developer on his LAN, would be hell on internet routers.  So the people who benefit are the ones who don't know what they are doing and only use the defaults.",
      "Thanks for the reminder to set this on the new framework I\u2019m working on. :)",
      "Oh hey! It\u2019s been a while how\u2019re you?!",
      "> It should be something that an engineer needs to be forced to set while creating a socket, instead of letting the OS choose a default.If the intention is mostly to fix applications with bad `write`-behavior, this would make setting TCP_DELAY a pretty exotic option - you would need a software engineer to be both smart enough to know to set this option, but not smart enough to distribute their write-calls well and/or not go for writing their own (probably better fitted) application-specific version of Nagles.",
      "I agree, it has been fairly well known to disable Nagle's Algorithm in HFT/low latency trading circles for quite some time now (like > 15 years).  It's one of the first things I look for.",
      "I was setting TCP_NODELAY at Bear Stearns for custom networking code circa 1994 or so.",

      "The feature for sending messaging and posting comments to a tab is some pretty clever and creative UX. Seriously next level future stuff and congrats for just coming up with the concept.I like that it's all timeline based. For my use case, we currently use Front email thread and then link to a Shared Dropbox where we post everything (including links to like a Google Doc or webpage). I think having chronological bookmarks like you do would be clearly better. I also know many people who use Google Groups and Google Doc to document progress too -- which I think would be insane / nightmare but teams do it. You all definitely would solve that automatically.Couple other notes:- Whenever I screenshare with a team or others I see 1000 bookmarks or tabs on their browser. I could not imagine the nightmare of how that would impact my workflow or the timeline. Trusting AI to clean stuff up or hunt is not for me.- I can tell you all have been heads down blitzing (dog in video, phone ringing in background of another) but I think a separate \"Solutions\" page where you tackle specific examples would be nice to see or browse.- Maybe too much or not really your goal, but right now need some sort of client integration for an outside person. I can't imagine giving access to a client on a whim and training them on this. Instead, maybe automatic email integration where their emails show up in the timeline and can respond directly from there. Would produce a really great timeline for where things left off and when things are being communicated. Being able to sub-comment and share files/updates/things on Front on email threads is one of the most killer features for productivity and a team. Mixing this with what you all have could be even more next level. Again though, might not be the goal.Congrats and best of luck! Big fan of people trying to tackle PM stuff and think you all are doing a great job.",

      "> - Peak baby - 2013. [2]I think your source's claim that \"The planet will never see more babies than it has in 2013\" is open to question.To just use the US as an example: mainstream Americans have a declining fertility rate, and we have no reason to think that is going to reverse in the foreseeable future. Immigrants have higher fertility, but they tend to converge to the mainstream after a generation or two. So, that seems to support the article's contention, at least for the US \u2013 and if we look at other countries, we observe things are broadly similar, so that in turn supports that contention for the planet as a whole.However, we also observe in the US small, ultra-conservative religious minorities, such as the Amish and ultra-Orthodox Jews, who still have a high fertility rate, and also have high youth retention (80-90% of their children will stay in the group as adults). Now, even though these groups are a tiny percentage of the population, the miracle of exponential growth means that within 2-3 centuries, they could be the majority of the US population, which could then result in a national baby boom. And, eventually, as they spread across the globe (they exist to varying degrees in other countries too), a global baby boom. So 2013's \"peak baby\" may end up being surpassed.Of course, there is no guarantee that is going to happen \u2013 maybe they'll get to a certain size, and then they'll stop growing. And of course, it is physically impossible to sustain exponential growth indefinitely. However, it remains a possible future that they won't stop growing until after they've gotten so big that 2013 turns out not to be the year of \"peak baby\" after all. Maybe it will actually be 2213 or 2313 instead. Our descendants (if one happens to have them) will find out.",
      "> Maybe it will actually be 2213 or 2313 instead. Our descendants (if one happens to have them) will find out.Peak-anything is just shorthand for \"the first peak on record\" because our culture and ability to record-keep has only really existed in a population and resource boom period.I agree that circumstances might mean that the global peak baby might be 200-300 years away, but the thing that makes the current round of peak-anything relevant is that we don't know how our social and economic systems will function when certain things are in long-term decline (even if they do pick up again in a few hundred years).If we knew what a few centuries of low birth rates or low oil consumption looked like, we wouldn't be nearly as interested in what \"peak-those-things\" means, the same way we're not all that interested in specific market peaks because we understand the boom/bust cycles and long-term productivity increases, etc.",
      "> the miracle of exponential growth means that within 2-3 centuries,I don't know if any realm of human sciences where extrapolating exponential growth yields trustworthy results, outside maybe of wealth accumulation, and even then not for 2 centuries.",
      "I never claimed that it is inevitable that they'll sustain their current growth rate for the next 2-3 centuries, only that it is entirely possible. And I don't see why it wouldn't be. If you look at ultra-Orthodox Jews in New York/New Jersey, I don't see how they'd hit any natural barriers to their continued growth until they are many times larger than they are now, at which point they'd be a serious challenger for becoming the population majority.The main ways it might not happen would be if either (1) they (gradually or suddenly) abandon their current culture for a less fertile one, (2) mainstream society persecutes them sufficiently. Both are entirely possible, but neither is anywhere near certain.The situation for the (Old Order) Amish is more difficult, since \u2013 unlike ultra-Orthodox Jews \u2013 they'll run out of enough land to sustain their agrarian lifestyle, and will have to transition to a more urban one. While the more urban lifestyle of ultra-Orthodox Jews demonstrates it is possible for insular high fertility religious minorities to exist in an urban setting, there is a real risk that they might lose their fertility and/or their insularity in the process.Also, people often bring up the problem Israel has with many ultra-Orthodox Jews not working and relying on government subsidies to live. That is much less of a problem in the US than it is in Israel, so the sustainability of that lifestyle is less of a barrier to future growth in the US than it is in Israel. Furthermore, the fact they manage to grow so much in the US without doing that, means being forced to stop doing that isn't necessarily going to stop their growth in Israel either."

But being able to define my classes in different places is also nice. And being able to define methods on the classes is nice. And defining a function that will only accept particular variant is nice.From my perspective a discriminant vs a vtable pointer is a boring implementation detail the compiler should just figure out for me based on what would be more optimal in a given situation.",
      "> I have multiple times wondered which of those two approaches would be better in a given situation, often wanting some aspects of both.ADTs are closed to extension with new cases but open to extension with new functions, eg. anytime you want to add new cases, you have to update all functions that depend on the ADT, but you can add as many functions for that ADT as you like with no issues.Traits are open to extension with new cases but closed to extension with new functions, eg. you can add as many impl as you like with no issues (new cases), but if you want to add a new function to the trait you have to update all impl to support it.They are logical duals, and the problem of designing systems that are open to extension in both cases and functions is known as the expression problem:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem",
      "I suppose this is a genuine dichotomy, but I feel like it\u2019s missing a more critical difference: ADTs cleanly represent data, even when nothing can be, or needs to be, extended from outside.For example, a result is a success value or an error.  A stock order is a market order or a limit order, and nothing else, at least until someone updates the spec and recompiles the code. Situations like this happen all the time.  I don\u2019t want to extend a result to include gizmos in addition to success value or errors, nor do I generally want to extend the set of functions that operate on a certain sort of result.  But I very, very frequently want to represent values with a specific, simple schema, and ADTs fit the bill. A bunch of structs/classes, interfaces/traits and getters/setters can do this, but the result would look like the worst stereotypes of enterprise Java code to accomplish what a language with nice ADTs can do with basically no boilerplate.",
      "> For example, a result is a success value or an error. A stock order is a market order or a limit order, and nothing else, at least until someone updates the spec and recompiles the code.But that's just it, specs are rarely complete because reality is fluid. For example, a result is a success or an error, until maybe you want an errors to prompt the user to correct something and then the computation can be resumed (see resumable exceptions).Should you even have to recompile your code to handle new cases? Why can't you just add the new case, and define new handlers for the functions that depend on your ADT without recompiling that code? That's the expression problem."

      "This is impressive work, especially for a one man show!One thing that stood out to me was the graph of the sentiment analysis over time, I hadn't seen something like that before and it was interesting to see it for Rust. What were the most positive topics over time? And were there topics that saw very sudden drops?I also found this sentence interesting, as it rings true to me about social media  \"there seems to be a lot of negative sentiment on HN in general.\" It would be cool to see a comparison of sentiment across social media platforms and across time!",
      "Thanks! Yeah I'd like to dive deeper into the sentiment aspect. As you say it'd be interesting to see some overview, instead of specific queries.The negative sentiment stood out to me mostly because I was expecting a more \"clear-cut\" sentiment graph: largely neutral-positive, with spikes in the positive direction around positive posts and negative around negative posts. However, for almost all my queries, the sentiment was almost always negative. Even positive posts apparently attracted a lot of negativity (according to the model and my approach, both of which could be wrong). It's something I'd like to dive deeper into, perhaps in a future blog post.",
      "The sentiment issue is a curious one to me. For example, a lot of humans I interact with that are not devs take my direct questioning or critical responses to be \"negative\" when there is no negative intent at all. Pointing out something doesn't work or anything that the dev community encounters on a daily basis isn't an immediate negative sentiment but just pointing out the issues. Is it a meme-like helicopter parent constantly doling out praise positive so that anything differing shows negativity? Not every piece of art needs to be hung on the fridge door, and providing constructive criticism for improvement is oh so often framed as negative. That does the world no favors.Essentially, I'm not familiar with HuggingFace or any models in this regard. But if they are trained from the socials, then it seems skewed from the start to me.Also, fully aware that this comment will probably be viewed as negative based on stated assumptions.edit: reading further down the comments, clearly I'm not the first with these sentiments.",

I did it with a much smaller set of data, using LLM's to make calm variations and an algo to pick the closest least spicy one to make the synthetic training data then used Phi 2. I used Detoxify then OpenAI's sentiment analysis is free, I use that to verify Detoxify has correctly identified spicy comments then generate a calm pair. I do worry that HN could implode / degrade if there is not able to be a good balance for the comments and posts that people come here for. Maybe I can use your sentiment data to mine faster and generate more pairs. I've only done an initial end-to-end test so far (which works!). The model, so far is not as high quality as I'd like but I've not used Phi 3 on it yet and I've only used a very small fine-tune dataset so far. \nFile is here though: https://huggingface.co/lukestanley/ChillTranslator\nI've had no feedback from anyone on it though I did have a 404 in my Show HN post!",

      "> Guaranteed \"exactly once\" delivery of messages to a consumer within a visibility timeoutThat's not going to be true. It might be true when things are running well, but when it fails, it'll either be at most once or at least once. You don't build for the steady state, you build against the failure mode. That's an important deciding factor in whether you choose a system: you can accept duplicates gracefully or you can accept some amount of data loss.Without reviewing all of the code, it's not possible to say what this actually is, but since it seems like it's up to the implementor to set up replication, I suspect this is an at-most-once queue (if the client receives a response before the server has replicated the data and the server is destroyed, the data is lost). But depending on the diligence of the developer, it could be that this provides no real guarantees (0-N deliveries).",
      "It will be true because of the \"within a visibility timeout\" right? Of course that makes the claim way less interesting.I took a peek at the code and it looks like their visibility timeout is pretty much a lock on a message. So it's not exactly once for any meaningful definition, but it does prevent the same message from being consumed multiple times within the visibility timeout.",
      "> it does prevent the same message from being consumed multiple times within the visibility timeout.... When there is no failure of the underlying system. The expectation of any queue is that messages are only delivered once. But that's not what's interesting: what matters is what happens when there's a system failure: either the message gets delivered more than once, the message gets delivered zero times, or a little of column A and a little of column B (which is the worst of both worlds and is a bug). If you have one queue node, it can fail and lose your data. If you have multiple queue nodes, you can have a network partition. In all cases, it's possible to not know whether the message was processed or not at some point",
      "The Two Generals Problem is a great thought experiment that describes how distributed consensus is impossible when communication between nodes has the possibility of failing.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem",
      "If the message never reaches the queue (network error, database is down, app is down, etc), then yes that is a 0 delivery scenario. Once the message reaches the queue though, it is guaranteed that only a single consumer can read the message for the duration of the visibility timeout. FOR UPDATE guarantees only a single consumer can read the record, and the visibility timeout means we don't have to hold a lock. After that visibility timeout expires, it is an at-least-once scenario. Any suggestion for how we could change the verbiage on the readme to make that more clear?",
      "You are talking about distributed systems, nobody expects to read \"exactly once\" delivery. If I read that on the docs, I consider that a huge red flag.And the fact is that what you describe is a performance optimization, I still have to write my code so that it is idempotent, so that optimization does not affect me in any other way, because exactly once is not a thing.All of this to say, I'm not even sure it's worth mentioning?",
      "> Once the message reaches the queue though, it is guaranteed that only a single consumer can read the message for the duration of the visibility timeout.But does the message get persisted and replicated before any consumer gets the message (and after the submission of the message is acked)? If it's a single node, the answer is simply \"no\": the hard drive can melt before anyone reads the message and the data is lost. It's not \"exactly once\" if nobody gets the message.And if the message is persisted and replicated, but there's subsequently a network partition, do multiple consumers get to read the message? What happens if writing the confirmation from the consumer fails, does the visibility timeout still expire?> After that visibility timeout expires, it is an at-least-once scenario.That's not really what \"at least once\" refers to. That's normal operation, and sets the normal expectations of how the system should work under normal conditions. What matters is what happens under abnormal conditions.",
      "As u/Fire-Dragon-DoL says, you can have an exactly-once guarantee within this small system, but you can't extend it beyond that.  And even then, I don't think you can have it.  If the DB is full, you can't get new messages and they might get dropped, and if the threads picking up events get stuck or die then messages might go unprocessed and once again the guarantee is violated.  And if processing an event requires having external side-effects that cannot be rolled back then you're violating the at-most-once part of the exactly-once guarantee.",
      "> you can have an exactly-once guarantee within this small systemIt's actually harder to do this in a small system. I submit a message to the queue, and it's saved and acknowledged. Then the hard drive fails before the message is requested by a consumer. It's gone. Zero deliveries, or \"at most once\".> If the DB is full, you can't get new messages and they might get droppedIn this case, I'd expect the producer to receive a failure, so technically there's nothing to deliver.> if the threads picking up events get stuck or dieWhile this obviously affects delivery, this is a concurrency bug and not a fundamental design choice. The failures folks usually refer to in this context are ones that are outside of your control, like hardware failures or power outages.",
      "> That's not going to be true. It might be true when things are running well, but when it fails, it'll either be at most once or at least once.Silly question as somebody not very deep in the details on this.It's not easy to make distributed systems idempotent across the board (POST vs PUT, etc.)Distributed rollbacks are also hard once you reach interacting with 3rd party APIs, databases, cache, etc.What is the trick in your \"on message received handler\" from the queue to achieve \"exactly once\"? Some kind of \"message hash ID\" and then you check in Redis if it has already been processed either fully successfully, partially, or with failures? That has drawbacks/problems too, no? Is it an impossible problem?"

      "There certainly is a real concern for astronomers, but the photo illustrations used in the article are selected to make things seem worse than they really are. They're wide field of view, long-duration exposures. That used to be the way astronomers imaged space, with film systems a century ago. But these days astronomical telescopes tend to have much narrower fields of view (like tiny soda straws peering into one particular spot in space) and use image stacking, a technique where many individual images are processed to form the final image (very simplistic overview: https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/astrophotography/astropho... .) Using image stacking and armed with accurate catalogs that predict precisely where every satellite will be at any time, enables the removal of satellites during the image stacking process. Or they can just use that information for better scheduling: wait a minute or two to image a particular spot, so there won't be satellites in the field of view.The article definitely gets this part right:> \u201cSome astronomers see this as a true \u2018hair on fire\u2019 emergency, heralding irretrievable losses to space science; others present a more sanguine face, depicting this as yet another challenge to be surmounted in surveying a decreasingly pristine sky,\u201d Koplow remarks.Being involved in both space and astronomy plants me squarely in the latter camp. It takes a bit more work and software, but having so many satellites in space is a surmountable challenge for terrestrial astronomers. (Not to mention, these days some of the best astronomy is performed by telescopes in space, so astronomy overall benefits by having easier access to space.)",
      "> They're wide field of view, long-duration exposures. That used to be the way astronomers imaged space,Sorry, but one of the two example images (https://noirlab.edu/public/images/iotw1946a/) is a single 333-second exposure with a modern survey camera, the Dark Energy Camera.  This is not particularly long nor does it represent some outmoded observational strategy.  Large, wide-field imaging sky surveys (such as the upcoming Rubin Observatory) are among the highest-profile ground-based astronomy projects today.Masking and stacking can mitigate the problem but it does not of course compensate for the lost area and sensitivity.  And the brightest satellites (like BlueWalker) saturate the readout electronics and spoil the whole exposure.Narrow field instruments (such as spectrographs) have less geometric chance of seeing a satellite but tend to take longer exposures (tens of minutes), so there is a greater loss of telescope time when a streak does happen.Even space telescopes are affected by streaks (https://www.space.com/hubble-images-spoiled-starlink-satelli...).> It takes a bit more work and softwareEquivalently, it takes more money and time.  That just means less science, given flat to declining funding from Congress.",

And the brightest satellites (like BlueWalker) saturate the readout electronics and spoil the whole exposure.Is this only a problem in systems that aren't aware of where the satellites will be? I naively assume that, if the system knew, it could start exposing in the next clear window. I naively assume that the window is almost always clear, especially for an individual sensor.",
      "Where do you see that the full well of those CCDs are fully saturated by a single satellite streak?Even if that was the case, that seems a very poor design for a sensor and not really an issue of satellites. If a satellite streak can saturate your well, then so could a decently dense star field.Do they blow out the individual pixels? Sure. But you just stack.You don't lose sensitivity just because your stack rejected pixels, that's not how stacking works. You wind up with a tiny bit more noise, how much more depends on your capture. But not lower sensitivity, stacking isn't just average an area",
      "Forget satellites; you can't do raw long-exposure for \"serious\" terrestrial-based astronomy anymore because you'll get planes in the way.",
      "> the photo illustrations used in the article are selected to make things seem worse than they really areExactly. I do a LOT of astrophotography and satellite trails are actually very easy to get rid of. Even the stupidest, most naive outlier rejection techniques, such as taking a stack of tracked images, finding their mean and standard deviation, throwing out any data points outside of 2 standard deviations, and then re-averaging, will get rid of the satellites very cleanly. You can go to more advanced techniques such as doing linear fits and RANSAC and whatnot, but you get the idea.NOT doing any outlier rejection, just taking the mean of all the images will show the satellite tracks, but very dimly. The people who are trying to make noise on social media deliberately and disingenuously take the max() instead of the mean() to make the problem seem worse than it is.That said -- in all of my imaging sessions, aircraft are a much, much, much bigger problem than satellites, and still easy to deal with. Yet nobody makes any noise about aircraft.",

With c chosen to ensure continuity in the transform.In the example from matplotlib I linked in the earlier comment they call out that the symlog transform has a discontinous gradient at the a's, and that the asinh transform can be used instead if that's a problem.Edit: On reflection it's probably not entirely correct to talk about it as choosing an appropriate c. Since that transform seems to kinda break apart around a=1. Simpler to consider it a matter of plotting on a logarithmic scale down to some value. Then continuing the plot on a linear scale until you reach the negative value on the other side and then plotting on a negative logarithmic scale (-log(|x|)).",
      "It's also harder to interpret. What the heck does `log(x + sqrt(x^2 + 1))` mean?It's a great transformation for data viz or machine learning / statistical modeling, but its not really obvious what an IHS-transformed variable represents.",
      "> It's also harder to interpret. What the heck does `log(x + sqrt(x^2 + 1))` mean?once you see the shape plotted, i dont think it's much harder than understanding the shape of logistic functions, which have similar formulations, and are used all over the place in ai/ml for activation, etc.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function",

That is stunning.To think that\u2019s one single millimeter of our brain and look at all those connections.Now I understand why crows can be so smart walnut sized brain be damned.What an amazing thing brains are.Possibly the most complex things in the universe.Is it complex enough to understand itself though? Is that logically even possible?",

      "My Mom was born with less than half of her hearing in left ear and barely anything at all in right ear. She had surgery as an adult and it slightly improved, especially on the right side.Pretty sure this little girl and my Mom don't share the same disability at all but she saw these news today and texted me so excited because future kids won't have to endure the same.Brings tears to my eyes, I'm so grateful for modern medicine and its stupendous advances.",
      "It might be the condition I have, otosclerosis, where the bones of the middle ear fuse. The surgery, a stapedectomy, involves removing the bones and replacing them with a metallic prosthesis. Unfortunately, in my case, the calcification is also happening in my cochlea which means that at some indeterminate time in the future, I will end up losing all hearing. Not to mention that even with the prosthetic, my hearing isn\u2019t 100% so I have a difficult time understanding speech. There might be some gene therapy that can remedy things, but I think what I may be hoping to see is the ability to grow a new inner and middle ear from stem cells and transplant them into my head, but I suspect that at age 55, I won\u2019t see this happen in time for me.",
      "I had no idea that was possible. If you'd asked me, I would have guessed that it wasn't.Astonishing. Sorry it's not a permanent fix for you, but it's impressive as hell that they could do anything.",
      "I was recently diagnosed with otosclerosis, have you found a hearing aid that works best for otosclerosis, my Doctor mentioned that most hearing aids don't work well for low frequency loss.",
      "I have moderate to severe hearing loss mostly in the low frequency region from otosclerosis...I use Widex Moment 440s BTE with custom ear moulds. They sound fantastic.  My only complaint is that require a necklace pendant to get Bluetooth connectivity but other than that I love them.  They're expensive but worth every penny IMO.",
      "Thank you to share about your personal experience.  Will a cochlear implant help for your condition?",
      "It will, but with the caveat that hearing with a cochlear implant is (at least at current technology levels), inferior to hearing with an actual cochlea. So there\u2019s a balancing act where they want to continue having me hear with my cochlea as long as possible. The other problem is that with a CI, I have no hearing at all without the receiver which means that I would be completely deaf while swimming, showering, etc. while I have at least some hearing without my hearing aids right now (although I had an ear infection in December which left me completely deaf for a week. It was a bit startling how much people were unwilling to engage in the smallest adaptations for me\u2014I found how to set up live transcriptions on my phone and I remember the cashier at the grocery store being unwilling to use that so I could see what she was saying).",
      "(With the live transcription feature, I was actually able to engage in normal-ish telephone conversations, maybe even a little more effective than I can with using the audio.)",
      "Another viable future tech for this might be neural implants similar to Neuralink. Not sure how viable it would be.",
