      "> move them over to ChatGPTOpenAI has even more VC money to pay back than Google ever did.Practically all the large tech companies so far have turned to ads and monetizing users rather than charging enough to  remain more neutral.I suspect one day, when you ask ChatGPT \"Can you give me a link to mid journey\", you'll instead probabilistically get a link to whichever competitor paid OpenAI for the best placement.reply",

      "Wait long enough and it seems like almost any company tries anything to increase its bottom line, but the main difference between ChatGPT and Google is at least ChatGPT attempts to give a paid option. Again, I don't think that'll stop them from ever getting to that point... but it'll go farther than \"here's search, we pay for it via adtech\".Kagi is a similar boat - the product is what you pay for, not what they can get users to put up with.reply",
      "> at least ChatGPT attempts to give a paid option. Again, I don't think that'll stop them...Netflix also attempted to give a paid option, but now we have an \"ad-supported\" plan. I think that same logic of maximizing profit means that even if there are some people paying for ChatGPT, the amount of free money that is sitting on the table means that we will see \"ad-supported\" ChatGPT pretty soon once the low-hanging fruit for quality enhancement start to dry up, which is kind of already happening.reply",

It would be wildly unprecedented to not follow up the amount of hype and fundraising in the LLM AI industry without a massive amount of enshittification following it.Even if improvements continue for years we might already be near the peak of LLM usefulness because all of greedy and abusive dark patterns are sure to follow once the manic land grab settles down.reply",
      "This is one of the reasons why I\u2019m getting familiar with self-hosting. Local models are improving shockingly fast. I use Gemma3 27B for generating summaries of podcast transcripts, for instance.reply",
      "1. The reason why ChatGPT is free despite being honestly very advanced, is that they want the general public to have an association of ChatGPT being \"the default AI\", just like Google is the default search engine and YouTube is the default video platform. Once they have this position they can throw as much garbage at the users as they want and nobody will care. This is why it doesn't really matter how much it costs now to capture the market, if the potential benefits are huge.2. Once the market is captured and solidified, ads and enshittification ensue. If you're willing to put on your tin foil hat for a second, I'd tell you that as a matter of fact the technologies to integrate different services with ChatGPT are being developed right now, and once they're ready it's just a small step to make sure that ChatGPT prioritizes answers mentioning those integrated partners, which can easily be justified to users as legit quality-of-life improvements.Maybe the answer is indeed to just buy a book and go touch some literal grass, and let the civilization drown in the sewer of disinformation it produces.reply"

      "If the funding is available immediately (not just an immediate commitment for funding once they start a batch), would it address the following problem I've run into a few times?In the last year alone, I've had to bow out of co-founding two promising startups with good biz co-founders, because first-year MBA students wanted to finish their degree before they sought funding.Two ways funding could help:1. I couldn't afford to work over a year as a technical cofounder, executing in full-time startup mode like usually needs to be done, for over a year, with no income.  While they were part-time, and getting an MBA and networking out of it during this period.  Even ramen lifestyle funding would've made this closer to an equitable balance of contribution and risk among the cofounders.2. There's also the concern that MBA programs seem to push students to have a hypothetical startup, so there's always a chance that the MBA student won't be fully committed to the business once they graduate.  Maybe accepted funding could make this a firmer commitment.  (Even if there's no contractual obligation to pursue the startup, I'd guess that new MBA graduates don't want to burn bridges in the small world of investors.)reply",

      "Tell the people with any CS experience they're not allowed to talk, and then let everyone just go for it.The first part is crucial, because if the group has two or more people exposed to CS courses, they'll invariably start negotiating the optimal algorithm to use while trying to recall the actual implementation, thus preventing any actual sorting from taking place.reply",
      "Real objects are basically always either psuedo-radix because you have a good idea of the distribution and aren't limited to pairwise comparison, or psuedo-selection because the objects are big and heavy so you don't want to move them more than necessary. For people self-sorting psuedo-radix is definitely the way because they can self-parallelize easily.I say psuedo because real objects have lots of properties both on the rearranging and comparison sides that are not quite the same as digital ones. For eg it's faster to compare numbers that have a large difference in magnitude, and it's easier to swap objects that are physically close to each other. So following a CS algorithm to the letter is usually slower than adapting a little.reply",

A group enters the area and sorts themselves by standing near the place on the diagram where their seat is, then boards the plane in line. As each chunk boards, they\u2019re already in the right order so that nobody is blocking anyone while trying to stuff their overhead luggage.I\u2019m not sure if any company has implemented the system but there was some test a company did of a bunch of boarding techniques and it was the most efficient.reply",

      "(non-expert)This is promising but needs publication and expert review.Here's the actual company statement from today:  https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii\n\nThere's also a June 2024 article:    https://www.cgtlive.com/view/huntington-disease-gene-therapy-nets-rmat-designation\n\nThat explains a bit more: (1) neuro-surgery introduces gene-virus to putamen and caudate nucleus; (2) virus delivers gene that produces micro-RNA; (3) the micro-RNA blocks the messenger RNA of the bad gene, reducing bad protein production.The 2023 study is said to have 39 patients (BBC and their recent statement reports 29).  The reported findings may be significant but seem small (e.g., low dose: 0.39 of 14.1 points). Earlier they reported composites from the Unified HD Rating Scale, which has the usual caveats for the behavioral and functional sub-measures (vs. the more reliable motor and cognitive).  Today's statement instead focuses on the more objective measures instead of the composite.Earlier, high-dose responders reportedly didn't just stabilize but got better -- unclear how.  The more recent findings report that the disability still progressed, but slowed relative to \"propensity-matched\" controls.  (Note 4 of 10 controls opted to join the trial after 12 months.)Both mention improvement in NfL (neurofilament light chains), which is an objective but nonspecific (and highly variable) measure of the degree of neuronal decomposition.  The statement quantifies this at ~8% -- unclear if this level is convincing.For such an invasive treatment for a slowly progressing, relatively rare disease, they're probably gathering and publishing data as fast as possible.  The short-term results seem good, and it will be good to see long-term results over time.It's possible some effect seen is due e.g., to immune adjuvants or something else during the therapy, and I would want experts to review the propensity matching.I would be concerned that the micro-RNA produced either also binds with epitopes from other messenger RNA or induces some immune response.  Remember, there's no reversal agent or half-life elimination for such genetic treatments.So: room for hope but also for caution.reply",

      "> Interestingly, in the past, the US federal government actively made efforts to keep private organizations from becoming too dominant.Yes but one can't just ignore the federal government itself, as if this wasn't an organization. In this framing of small organizations kept small by the government the largest organization is the State. Indeed in this framing the State's job is to control other organizations. While a democratic state is different than a private organization in that it derives legitimacy from its voters, I'd be hard pressed to say that the state is sufficiently different from any other large organization. We can certainly see this now in the US in highly polarized times where the State bears opposition from half the country depending on who is in power.I think this \"anti-monopoly\" framing is a bit dangerous as it smuggles a political position into a much more complicated situation. There is an overall decline in the West of small association groups. More and more of these groups happen on Discord voice chats and are divorced from the real life constraints that offer a more \"grounded\" character. And I think this issue has been written about much less than the \"anti-monopoly\" one. Even if you fervently believe that the State needs to play an aggressive role in policing private organizations, I think it's more thought-provoking to think about ways to encourage more grassroots organizing.reply",
      "> While a democratic state is different than a private organization in that it derives legitimacy from its votersThis is exactly the key core distinction. The purpose of the state is to be the most powerful organization in the room - to constrain other actors. It\u2019s imperative, therefore, that it be democratic and representative. Notably, part of the instinct to break up other large organizations is to prevent them from assembling enough resources to have a supersized impact on the state - the problem with monopoly is that monopolies buy out their competition and neuter regulations, the problem with wealth disparity is the ultra wealthy are sufficiently powerful to move the state in the direction they want it to go.I agree with you generally regarding reducing the overall size of governing bodies and I agree with Terrence about the benefits of small organizations and the drawbacks of large specifically around the investment and perceived ownership of members of those organizations, but having a small state fundamentally requires having small organizations everywhere - and anti-monopoly, antitrust, and anti-wealth concentration - because for the state to be democratic and representative, it must be the most powerful organization in the area it covers, otherwise it\u2019s just a tool for the more powerful to use.reply",

      "Newly discovered potential antibiotics are actually pretty common, and they would be critical to solving the antibiotic-resistance menace.  But no major new families of antibiotics have been brought to market since about 01962, although a dozen or so families were discovered over the previous 20 years.  (Or, maybe one new family was.)  That was when drug regulation changed dramatically in the US with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefauver%E2%80%93Harris_Amendm..., for example requiring clinical trials to provide evidence that drugs were effective, rather than just safe.  It's also when they started outlawing recreational drugs; the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs wasn't until 01961, and it didn't cover amphetamines, downers, or psychedelics.Because so much of 20th-century drug research happened in the US (because the US had capitalism) the clinical-trials requirement and the Drug War there had an outsized effect, and other countries copied them afterwards.One particular case that I studied was Zasloff's \"magainin\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magainin which was denied licensing even though the clinical trials found that it was both safe and effective.  The problem was that it wasn't more effective than the existing standard of care; it was only equally effective.It seems certain that the Kefauver\u2013Harris Drug Act has prevented innumerable cases of useless or harmful drugs from being marketed.  But, looking at the history of drug development, it also seems clear that the rapid drug development in the decades up to 01962 virtually halted at that time, and the absence of the drugs that would have been discovered since then has surely killed many more people than the inadvertent use of harmful drugs ever could have.reply"

In these \"gaps,\" there are much fewer asteroids than you would normally expect to find.These gaps happen because of the strong gravity of the giant planet Jupiter. Jupiter's gravity pulls on the asteroids in a special way, creating what scientists call \"orbital resonances.\"The Kirkwood gaps were first discovered in 1857 by a scientist named Daniel Kirkwood. He was a professor at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Kirkwood was also the first to correctly explain why these gaps exist. He figured out they were caused by the orbital resonances with Jupiter.Imagine a busy highway where cars are usually spread out. Kirkwood gaps are like empty stretches on that highway where very few cars are driving. In space, these \"empty stretches\" are specific orbits within the asteroid belt.

      "> The joysticks are connected to a pilot hydraulic circuit, which proportionally moves the cylinders in the main hydraulic circuit which ultimately moves the excavator jointsI've actually spent a decent amount of time running an excavator, as my Dad owns a construction / road building company. It was a great summer job!An important note about the pilot hydraulics is that they _provide feedback to the operator_. I would encourage any system that moves these controls on behalf of a remote human operator or AI to add strain gauges or some other way to measure this force feedback so that this data isn't lost.The handful of \"drive by wire\" pieces of equipment that my Dad or other skilled operators in my family have ran were universally panned, because the operators are isolated from this feedback and have a harder time telling when the machine is struggling or when their inputs are not sufficiently smooth. In the automotive world, skilled drivers have similar complaints about fully electronic steering or braking systems, as opposed to traditional vacuum or hydraulic boosting approaches where your foot still has a direct hydraulic connection to the brake pads.reply",
      "You're right! This is exactly why we like to do mechanical actuation - we are able to achieve bilateral telepresence, which essentially gives the torque (haptic) feedback over the internet! So on small excavators, you can absolutely feel the resistance. We also stream the engine audio, which tells you how hard the hydraulic pump is working. Operators like our system for these reasons :)I'd like to get a chance to talk to you and your Dad to get feedback. How do I reach you?\nMy email is contact at useflywheel dot aireply",
      "Yes, and you also get feedback from your butt as the machine tips and wobbles, particularly on smaller machines.  Hearing the engine straining helps also. Often you can not clearly see what you are digging,  this feedback lets you know if you are running into a rock or something.One big advantage would be cameras mounted on the boom and rear view cameras,  as many machines have obstructed views.reply",
      "We're indeed streaming the audio and have haptic feedback. My hypothesis is the seat vibration isn't as helpful. It's sub optimal and operators would be far more productive without it. We would do a paper when we have enough data on this.\nWe're also putting more cameras but streaming a lot of them at once is tricky.reply",
      "Humbly, have you used excavators of varying sizes on uneven ground?  I have and would suggest it's more important than you might think. But if you've operated them, you might know better than I.Also, teleoperation is likely to produce lower-quality operation data than hooking up to locally operated excavators. Just a thought.reply",
      "I might be less experienced than you - I've operated upto 38 tons on maximum 15 degrees incline. I wasn't moving tracks a lot when I did that. Would like to hear what scenarios you'be been in and how would you describe your experience? Maybe I could try those out to learn more!reply",
      "I have a 20 ton Takeuchi and I don\u2019t recall any feedback in the controls at all. The feedback I use is from the seat and sounds of the machine - well besides of course visual of course.I cannot imagine this being useful to me unless the virtual operators cab closely mimicked an actual machine. It would have to have audio from the machine and be on a platform that tilted relative to the real thing. It would also need 270 degrees of monitors with a virtual mirror to see behind. On the front monitor, minimally, would need the to see vertically up and down too.I also imagine all of this would be more useful to seasoned operators who can do most things on excavators in their sleep (definitely not me lol)reply",
      "My car with its drive-by-wire brakes has a brake feedback simulator that gives the driver the kind of feeling associated with power-boosted hydraulic brakes. This is by far the most expensive single component in the car. Arguably these are just expensive accommodations for human flaws. A self-driving car wouldn't need them. Can't the self-driving system act directly on data like pressure, flow, and displacement?reply",
      "That's indeed what we're trying to test to the extreme - to see how far we could go with just vision. We haven't done heavy excavation workflows yet, but we have some early success with some excavation workflows with just vision input and joystick action output (even without joint angle feedback!).\nWe're betting on having really huge data with compact observation input and experiment to see if it holds water. If not we can always dial it down and add more sensors/feedback.reply",
      "Maybe it doesn't matter for a car because feeling the car's motion tells you most of what you need to know. A car is not meant to touch anything but the road, in normal conditions. I think steering is the only case where force feedback is very important for a car - In the winters up here, I can feel the steering go loose when I hit a patch of ice.I imagine an excavator, meant to touch and dig through things, and lift things, benefits from force feedback for the same reason VR would.Have you played those VR sword games? BeatSaber works great because you're cutting through abstract blobs that offer no resistance. But the medieval sword-slashing games feel weird because your sword can't impact your opponent.I saw a video recently of a quadcopter lifting heavy objects. When it's overloaded, it can't maneuver because all its spare power is spent generating lift to maintain altitude. If the controls had force feedback, the copter's computer could tell you \"I'm overloaded, I can't move\" by putting maximum resistance on the sticks.reply"

When I was a first time manager I had the naive idea that I was going to build consensus for everything and get everyone to come to an agreement naturally.It worked at first with a good team. Then later I inherited a fragment of another team with some older know-it-all engineers who thought everything modern was garbage and we should be doing everything like they did 25 years ago. I wasted too much time letting them stonewall everything while thinking we\u2019d eventually reach a consensus.Then at some point you realize you have to put your foot down and pick a direction after they\u2019ve had a chance to state their position.reply",
      "You can build consensus around the decision making process and build a culture where  the outcome of that process is widely accepted.

      "You could learn from consent based decision making, a hallmark of sociocratic worker coops that is underrated and can be applied elsewhere.Hierarchy and coercion isn't necessary for avoiding decision paralysis in organizations.

      "I don\u2019t think that is a practical framework for situations where people aren\u2019t already very closely aligned.\n What happens when a few people are very vocal (and firm) in opposition to basically every change? Having dissenting views is valuable, but not when they have veto power.\nAdditionally, I think that framework is vulnerable to what I refer to as \u201cdeath by yes but\u201d - when everyone is just piling on amendments and precursor conditions, oftentimes conflicting, that result in a decision taking months (maybe even years) to make or scuttle.I\u2019m basing these comments out of experience - one example is a workgroup/committee operating under a similar model that was completely unable to do anything due to decision paralysis. The committee grew significantly more effective when we reformed the decision making process to have a small group of owners to handle pitching and (potentially) implementing the decision, then had approval be a simple yes/no majority vote.reply",
      "Yes it only works when participants have a shared aimIn full sociocracy, it...> honors the circle\u2019s ability to freely make decisions within its domain. This is key for the organization to remain effective. But it comes at the cost of members not having \u201cconsent rights\u201d to every decision the organization makes. Each member will only have those rights for the circles they are a part of.So it's not necessary to allow people outside that working group to veto or require compulsory followup through objectionThere's no perfect solution to organization, everything is a tradeoff. I've also been part of working groups (made of people whose job description is to manage the scope of changes they're proposing) where everyone and the workers impacted by the decisions are in agreement and no impact on cost etc., but the exec decides no change can be made due to personal preference despite disastrous consequence. Or where an exec who abstains from checking in on a working group's efforts nonetheless counters it with shifting and contradictory demands whenever it comes time to take action, requiring going back to the drawing board repeatedly until people simply give up or leave the organization. Or where the exec asks for more data for a proposal, and then doesn't evaluate the data once gathered, leaving no recourse but to give up or leave the organization. We all have stories like this. Hierarchical organizations are also susceptible to paralysis.reply",

But given Go doesn't support simd, I knew it wouldn't be a fair fight against the other languages and more importantly, it would be boring let alone helping my day job.I figured to give go the best shake I needed to up the difficulty by adding multi-player to the simulation. After all, go is best known as a snappy productive backend language. Is it snappy and product"
