      "Firstly, at the $219 price point you can have my money already.Beyond that, things that appeal to me are basically anything which increase the likelihood I can accomplish high dexterous fine motor control skills, for things like tinkering and DIY assembly.  I think that would include extra wrist DOF and a longer-reach variant.Integrated cameras are an interesting idea, but I'd like to be able to swap them out for my own.My dream is to have some sort of multi-arm table at home.  I imagine holding a circuit board, small component, soldering iron, and wire with four robotic arms I control with shaky hands from my laptop. :D\n \nreply",
      "So true. Every time I solder surface mount components, I always wish I could have a steady hand. Sadly, this arm doesn't have that kind of accuracy. The output shaft of the servos we use has about 1 degree of wiggle room and the mechanical structure adds more.To get better accuracy, if sticking with this kind of RC servo, it's basically required to have two servos per joint to preload each other to kill that wiggle room. It's something I've been calculating, but I just can't figure out a way to offer it at a good price.Interestingly, for arms that are popular in academia, even when the price goes to $10k (like ARX or Trossen), the wiggle room is still there (better, but still there).\n \nreply",
      "I was recently trying to get better angular accuracy with servos and minimize backlash. One option that kind of worked was to have a pulley on the servo shaft which wound a string attached to a spring to add mechanical bias.But I ended up giving up and going with 400 step stepper motors instead. They're larger, draw more current, and the drive circuitry is more complicated (it can't get simpler than a PWM servo after all). But they're accurate and significantly quieter.\n \nreply",
      "I know nothing about the topic but could one build some kind of 3d pantograph to scale down the motions?\n \nreply",
      "What you need is to scale down the tolerances. To remove the wiggle room.One of the solutions that does not add a bias that I remember is two identical flat gears on the same axis with a spring that tries to rotate them one relative to another. This removes the wiggle room between this composite gear and the next, regular gear. The motor may have wiggle room, but the gears (which carry angle sensors, don't they?) move without wiggling, and react immediately as you reverse the direction. The load is limited though: the beating surface is twice as small, and the friction is higher.\n \nreply",
      "even something twice the price ($438) would still be a great deal. Mind telling us something about your pricing strategy trade-off consideration matrix?\n \nreply",
      "Design for manufacturing is one thing. I did it a lot when building micro gas turbines in college. Sometimes changing the design or manufacturing process will make it 10x faster to make one while not compromising the performance.The second thing is low margin. When people are pricing hardware, they usually plan a 50% to 100% margin to offset various costs that happen in the real world. From what I've heard, in extreme cases, some products cost around $100 while they are being sold at close to $1000. I believe in the Prusa printer approach: you design a good product and price it a little bit above cost. So the company grows with the community.Deep down, there are so many times that I wish I could afford a fancy tool like a Milwaukee drill or a Mitutoyo caliper. And in extreme cases, I really wish I could have a HAAS UMC-400 or even a KERN Micro HD+. Now that I can set the price, I really wish I could make someone get what they want without breaking their bank.\n \nreply",
      "For folks curious about why these kinds of margins are built in for hardware products, I found these videos informative:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwrkfHadeQQhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IdAT_SIRK8c&pp=QAFIAQ%3D%3Dhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=63pnz-z_2sU&pp=QAFIAQ%3D%3D\n \nreply",
      "that's really great, thanks for sharing!\n \nreply",

      "I have ~200 acres of land I fly a drone survey mission to map. Today, that piloting is done by dronelink and a DJI drone. The challenge is that it's about 3 hours of flight time, give or take, to cover the space, and a given battery is good for about 35 minutes of flight time.I have 4 batteries, which means I basically need to be refilling my batteries as quickly as I consume them in order to keep flying continuously (unfortunately, even with a quad-charger, I cannot fully sustain this.)I would LOVE to have a fixed wing drone that could fly over the area and snap close-to-nadir photos as it did so, but the complexity of building and programming a hand built drone seems so much higher than deploying an off the shelf DJI drone. Additionally, the land is steep, with a 1,000+ foot elevation difference, and rugged, and the neighboring land is airspace I cannot fly within, so I couldn't use it to perform my turns.Author, or others, any thoughts on whether it's worth pursuing a fixed wing aircraft to perform this mapping mission? Or is the best bang for my buck to just buy enough batteries to fly the mission continuously on an off the shelf quadcopter?\n \nreply",
      "Great question! I don't think there's any sub $5k VTOL you can just buy COTS that can get close to 3 hours of range. Also, nothing is as plug and play as DJI. If you're motivated enough to do a little DIY and learn how to use Ardupilot or PX4 (easier), you can buy a kit like the Heewing T2 VTOL and assemble yourself. But I don't think that will do more than two hours flight time, even with a similarly high energy density battery pack to what I used.\n \nreply",
      "I reviewed and purchased a smaller drone, from WHISPR. Through that, I looked at similar VTOL drones, which OP is demonstrating. In theory, they're cheap:https://www.uavmodel.com/products/makeflyeasy-hero-2180mm-ua...This one has a maximum climb rate of 3 degrees. Which means you'd need to plan a route that's continously climbing, and tacking back and forth to avoid going steeply. So you would probably combine flight planning using Mission Planning: https://ardupilot.org/planner/ and custom json tweaking following MavLink protocol: https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/mavlink-routing-in-ardupilot....The open source flight controllers and systems are https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-autopilots.html#ope... a good place to start. There's a few orgs building the full experience, but you'll of course pay for fully integrated, but still open source, hardware+software.The scenario you describe is exactly what a VTOL or normal play is for; quad copters simply do not cover enough ground.Also consider the camera. DJI typically ship with really low quality cameras, but https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1785754-REG/sony_ilx_... would get you a much higher pixel density so  if you're more interested in the imaging, you can flight higher, near the licensed ceiling, completing more ground faster.I've also found AI models know how to calculate pixel densities, so it's pretty easy to mock out a flight plan even if you dont have the actual drone available.\n \nreply",
      "for processing, I setup opendronemap: https://www.opendronemap.org/There really is a full open source hardware/software path, which is heartening.\n \nreply",
      "This actually has decent flight time! Could probably push close to 3 hours if using higher energy density (and cost) battery cells like the silicon anode ones I used.\n \nreply",
      "Happen to have the BoM and the 3d parts available in a repo?Would love to try my hand at reproducing the work you did!\n \nreply",
      "I'm curious how this compares to foam-frame designs. Being able to customize it is obviously a big advantage, as is the non-solid-infill of 3d-printed parts. I think for stiffness, 3d-printed frames don't work well for quadcopters compared to carbon fiber, but they sound like a nice alternative to foam for fixed-wing. I think the stiffness concern comes up in quads mainly when they do high-performance maneuvers that aren't a concern for the takeoff and landing this device does in that mode. (e.g. high accelerations/manevers of racing-style drones)If anyone wants to try this: The parts he uses are all standard Chinese-made COTS you can buy on amazon and similar.The ArduPilot firmware he uses is very flexible and robust, but setting it up is one of the worst UXs I've experienced. Commercial UASs almost  universally use PX4 instead.\n \nreply",
      "Yes I used single wall foaming PLA which is much less impact resistant and more brittle vs any foam, even cheap foamcore and especially EPP or EPO. This has definitely been an issue with crashing and rebuilding.But my first and only other VTOL build was foamcore Readyboard and that took a 12 ft drop onto asphalt with only a slight compression in the fuselage. Never replaced it.I would add dovetails or other clips for printed sections if I did another printed build.Yes avionics and propulsion parts are COTS for speed, the Amprius pack is US manufactured but others are all made in China.I'm starting to see some more Ardupilot used commercially too but yes the UX is janky and unintuitive.\n \nreply",
      "Hopefully now that it's in a polished state, you don't need to worry as much about impact resistance as you did when designing/tuning.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks, I did crash it again, and that's why it was half assembled on the wall at the end. But yeah foaming PLA is extremely soft, almost feels like tough, thin paper.\n \nreply"

A demonstration of certain principles lacking in existing OSes (and userland software)?3. Why try developing everything altogether? i.e. all of a kernel, low-level services/userland code, a graphical desktop environment, and applications?

      "I've reverse-engineered a couple of programs before in order to get them to do what I want. Things like setting default options in a program that doesn't let you change the defaults, or getting older Windows programs to function correctly.I've also patched open-source programs locally in order to get them to do what I want but wouldn't be suitable for upstreaming. For example, I've reverted the order of buttons in a \"do you want to save?\" close dialog when they changed in an update.Minor stuff, but just being able to do this is amazing. The trouble is, developers - at least those of closed-source programs - don't want you to be able to do that, partially due to a lot of them relying on security by obscurity in order to earn money.As such, it feels like the only way you're going to get developers to be on board with something like this is to be able to have them specify what people can change and what people can't change - and that's something that developers already do (whether they realise it or not) with things like INI files and the Registry.This is why people using UNIX-based systems campaign for small programs that do one thing and do it well.

From programming languages to operating systems and app stores, every layer of the modern computing landscape has been built upon the assumption that users are passive recipients rather than active co-creators.

I was met with the following:\"OpenAI requires bringing your own API key to use o3 over the API. Set up here: https://openrouter.ai/settings/integrations\"So I decided I would buy some API credits with my OpenAI account. I ponied up $20 and started Aider with my new API key set and o3 as the model. I get the following after sending a request:\"litellm.NotFoundError: OpenAIException - Your organization must be verified to use the model `o3`. Please go to:                                           https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general and click on Verify Organization. If you just verified, it can take up to 15 minutes for access to propagate.\"At that point, the frustration was beginning to creep in. I returned to OpenAI and clicked on \"Verify Organization\". It turns out, \"Verify Organization\" actually means \"Verify Personal Identity With Third Party\" because I was given the following:\"To verify this organization, you\u2019ll need to complete an identity check using our partner Persona.\"Sigh I click \"Start ID Check\" and it opens a new tab for their \"partner\" Persona.

You know it'll be an issue and if fixed now will cost $100, but if you fix it a year from now it'll cost $1000. Many people will choose the latter. On paper, I think most people will choose the former but in practice the latter is often hard to determine. An example might be a security risk. It only gets harder to fix as you generate more code and complexity increases. But of hacked this has high costs both through business and through lawsuits.The amortized one is a nasty problem because it often goes unnoticed. Say a problem costs $100 to fix now but every day it isn't fixed it costs $1.00 every day you don't fix it costs 5% more (so $1, $1.05, $1.1025,...).

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to run unsigned code during the boot process, effectively bypassing Secure Boot and compromising the system\u2019s chain of trust. Because the attacker\u2019s code executes before the operating system even loads, it opens the door for attackers to install bootkits and undermine OS-level security defenses. The story behind this discovery begins with a UEFI application we found on VirusTotal, signed with Microsoft\u2019s third-party UEFI certificate. This application has been publicly available since November 2024 when it was first submitted. However, the signature data indicates it was actually signed in October 2022, suggesting it may have been circulating for much longer. "
