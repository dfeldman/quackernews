Then you run the macro once and it runs over every line.This ends up being really efficient in terms of keystrokes but in practice I think it's hard to think about and not very ergonomic, so I don't end up using it much.

      "I really like uv, and it's the first package manager for a while where I haven't felt like it's a minor improvement on what I'm using but ultimately something better will come out a year or two later. I'd love if we standardized on it as a community as the de facto default, especially for new folks coming in. I personally now recommend it to nearly everyone, instead of the \"welllll I use poetry but pyenv works or you could use conda too\"\n \nreply",
      "I never used anything other than pip. I never felt the need to use anything other than pip (with virtualenv). Am I missing anything?\n \nreply",
      "Couple of things.- pip doesn't handle your Python executable, just your Python dependencies. So if you want/need to swap between Python versions (3.11 to 3.12 for example), it doesn't give you anything. Generally people use an additional tool such as pyenv to manage this. Tools like uv and Poetry do this as well as handling dependencies- pip doesn't resolve dependencies of dependencies. pip will only respect version pinning for dependencies you explicitly specify. So for example, say I am using pandas and I pin it to version X. If a dependency of pandas (say, numpy) isn't pinned as well, the underlying version of numpy can still change when I reinstall dependencies. I've had many issues where my environment stopped working despite none of my specified dependencies changing, because underlying dependencies introduced breaking changes. To get around this with pip you would need an additional tool like pip-tools, which allows you to pin all dependencies, explicit and nested, to a lock file for true reproducibility. uv and poetry do this out of the box.- Tool usage. Say there is a python package you want to use across many environments without installing in the environments themselves (such as a linting tool like ruff). With pip, you need to install another tool like pipx to install something that can be used across environments. uv can do this out of the box.Plus there is a whole host of jobs that tools like uv and poetry aim to assist with that pip doesn't, namely project creation and management. You can use uv to create a new Python project scaffolding for applications or python modules in a way that conforms with PEP standards with a single command. It also supports workspaces of multiple projects that have separate functionality but require dependencies to be in sync.You can accomplish a lot/all of this using pip with additional tooling, but its a lot more work. And not all use cases will require these.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, generally people already use an additional tool for managing their Python executables, like their operating system's package manager:  $> sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3.11 python3.12\n\nAnd then it's simple to create and use version-specific virtual environments:  $> python3.11 -m venv .venv3.11\n  $> source .venv3.11/bin/activate\n  $> pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nYou are incorrect about needing to use an additional tool to install a \"global\" tool like `ruff`; `pip` does this by default when you're not using a virtual environment. In fact, this behavior is made more difficult by tools like `uv` if or `pipx` they're trying to manage Python executables as well as dependencies.\n \nreply",
      "> sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3.11 python3.12This assumes the Python version you need is available from your package manager's repo. This won't work if you want a Python version either newer or older than what is available.> You are incorrect about needing to use an additional tool to install a \"global\" tool like `ruff`; `pip` does this by default when you're not using a virtual environment.True, but it's not best practice to do that because while the tool gets installed globally, it is not necessarily linked to a specific python version, and so it's extremely brittle.And it gets even more complex if you need different tools that have different Python version requirements.\n \nreply",
      ">This assumes the Python version you need is available from your package manager's repo. This won't work if you want a Python version either newer or older than what is available.And of course you could be working with multiple distros and versions of the same distro, production and dev might be different environment and tons of others concerns. You need something that just works across.\n \nreply",
      "Surely you just use Docker for production, right?\n \nreply",
      "(I've just learned about uv, and it looks like I have to pick it up since it performs very well.)I just use pipx. Install guides suggest it, and it is only one character different from pip.With Nix, it is very easy to run multiple versions of same software. The path will always be the same, meaning you can depend on versions. This is nice glue for pipx.My pet peeve with Python and Vim is all these different package managers. Every once in a while a new one is out and I don't know if it will gain momentum. For example, I use Plug now in Vim but notice documentation often refers to different alternatives these days. With Python it is pip, poetry, pip search no longer working, pipx, and now uv (I probably forgot some things).\n \nreply",
      "most developers I know do not use the system version of python. We use an older version at work so that we can maximize what will work for customers and don't try to stay on the bleeding edge. I imagine others do want newer versions for features, hence people find products like UV useful\n \nreply",

But these aren\u2019t the features that surprised me most.There\u2019s one small feature I initially overlooked that truly makes uv intriguing:Imagine doing some ad-hoc scripting in Python 3.12. You run python, and you\u2019re in the REPL, ready to go. But what if you need to pull in a dependency, like Pandas? Here\u2019s where it gets interesting.You would either:This gets even more interesting if you need some other Python version than your global one. You would then use something like pyenv, install the version and set that version as local.So, worst case:With uv, it\u2019s just 1 command:easy to remember, and no trace left behind.

If you have an opportunity to do it, I strongly recommend it.There are some very cool things you can do, but you\u2019re limited by the tile size, the inputs provided and it\u2019s worth noting that you get one chip on a module. It\u2019s probably the 2nd step in getting started making a custom ASIC if you wanted to get into that. (The first being learning how to design with logic gates)bitlui made a VGA Rickroll with it a while ago. [1]My tile spells out \u201cAaron\u201d (my first name) on the output to the seven segment display.I think there is enough room to make a simple microprocessor. Fun if you\u2019ve not ever done something like it.So, to answer your question - yes it could be useful if you had a very specific thing you wanted to do that made sense in silicon. You could buy extra tiles and get space. That said, it\u2019s mostly educational. But worth it if you have an interest.[1] https://youtu.be/DdF_nzMW_i8\n \nreply",

      "This is a great comprehensive article on the \"why\" and there are good YouTube videos on the \"how.\" What the article is missing that makes it even better is putting an SSD in which makes it even faster of course. You can get an untested Mac mini G4 for about $60 on eBay and the rest of the parts (SSD, PATA-mSATA adapter, RAM if less than 1 GB, power adapter, any missing screws, clock battery, etc.) will run you another $60 to make the ultimate Mac OS 9 machine. If you're comfortable taking things apart and putting them back together it's not too bad.A quick tip: be sure to reset the PRAM with command-alt-p-r holding down during restart until you hear 3 chimes. Then while the machine is booting hold down command-alt-o-f and type \"reset-nvram\" and then \"set-defaults\" and then \"reset-all\" (all of this is in open firmware) before installing Mac OS 9 to make sure firmware is in its original state.I came across this idea of SSD upgrading and installing Mac OS 9 in April 2024 and bought three broken ones to build one for my son. [0] When the first one worked, I ended up figuring, why not just finish the other two and sell them on eBay?That led me into a hobby business. I've now cleaned, upgraded with SSDs, and sold about 70 of them. The \"business\" basically breaks even, so it truly is a hobby. In fact I invested so much in inventory buying 90 of them in a lot at the end of 2024 that I am negative right now. I will probably turn a slight profit in 2025.

      "I do ship to Canada, but unfortunately the (auto-calculated by Shopify/UPS/DHL/USPS) international shipping prices are quite high (I've seen about $30 to Canada and $50 to Germany in the past). Plus in some countries the purchaser ends up having to pay duties, so check your local laws. A way somewhat around this is to buy from me on eBay since they take care of the shipping and duties, and have lower shipping costs:https://www.ebay.com/usr/oaksnowconsultingllcThe downside is packages through eBay International Shipping tend to take like a month whereas UPS ships packages in less than a week pretty much anywhere. I sold one on os9.shop to Germany last month that got to Germany in 3 days and to the person's door in 5.My prices on os9.shop are also lower to begin with because I don't have any eBay fees. The equivalent package on os9.shop to the eBay packages is the Average Condition bundles. US customers should definitely buy at https://os9.shop since it's the same stuff and the prices are lower and the shipping is the same.\n \nreply",
      "RE: shipping to Canada:  use USPS.  Using Fedex or UPS will incur gigantic \"brokerage fees\" which you are not charged when using USPS + Canada Post.  We're talking like $30+ on a $100 package, and that's upon arrival to your door, after you already paid $20-30 shipping.  I got a plexiglass trophy from an event at my work and it cost me $25 to receive it because they used UPS to ship it.\n \nreply",
      "When customers are checking out they have the option to choose USPS, UPS, etc. I've seen prices to Canada be more for USPS than UPS. Shopify handles most of this. I don't charge any handling so it's just whatever the raw shipping cost that is calculated by Shopify/USPS/etc.\n \nreply",
      "Oh, perfect!  I didn't realize there was a choice during checkout.  I can imagine the initial price is more, but it will be less in total once the package arrives to the door.My \"favorite\" thing about UPS is they like to leave a COD invoice, when they were _supposed_ to collect the fee from you before releasing the package -- but that takes too long so they just leave an invoice.

      "We had a similar CDN problem with releasing major Warframe updates: our CDN partner would inadvertently DDoS our origin servers when we launched an update because thousands of cold edges would call home simultaneously when all players players relogged at the same time.One CDN vendor didn't even offer a tiered distribution system so every edge called home at the same time, another vendor did have a tiered distribution system designed to avoid this problem but it was overwhelmed by the absurd number of files we'd serve multiplied by the large user count and so we'd still end up with too much traffic hitting the origin.The interesting thing was that no vendor we evaluated offered a robust preheating solution if they offered one at all. One vendor even went so far as to say that they wouldn't allow it because it would let customers unfairly dominate the shared storage cache at the edge (which sort of felt like airlines overbooking seats on a flight to me).These days we run an army of VMs that fetch all assets from every point of presence we can cover right before launching an update.Another thing we've had to deal with mentioned in the article is overloading back-end nodes; our solution is somewhat ham-fisted but works quite well for us: we cap the connection counts to the back end and return 503s when we saturate. The trick, however, is getting your load-balancer to leave the client connection open when this happens -- by default multiple LBs we've used would slam the connection closed so that when you're serving up 50K 503s a second the firewall would buckle under the runaway connection pool lingering in TIME_WAIT.

      "This problem is similar to what electric utilities call \"load takeup\". After a power outage, when power is turned back on, there are many loads that draw more power at startup.The shortest term effects are power supplies recharging their capacitors and incandescent bulbs warming up. That's over within a second.Then it's the motors, which have 2x-3x their running load when starting as they bring their rotating mass up to speed. That extra load lasts for tens of seconds.If power has been off for more than a few minutes, everything in heating and cooling which normally cycles on and off will want to start. That high load lasts for minutes.Bringing up a power grid is thus done by sections, not all at once.\n \nreply",
      "I live in a somewhat rural area and we got bit hard by this last winter.Our road used to have a handful of houses on it but now has around 85 (a mix of smaller lots around an acre and larger farming parcels).  Power infrastructure to our street hasn't been updated recently and it just barely keeps up.We had a few days that didn't get above freezing (very unusual here). Power was out for about 6 hours after a limb fell on a line. The power company was actually pretty quick to fix it, but the power went out 3 more times in pretty quick succession.Apparently a breaker kept blowing as every house regained power and all the various compressors surged on. The solution at the time was for them to jam in a larger breaker. I hope they came back pretty quickly to undo that \"fix\" but we still haven't had any infrastructure updates to increase capacity.\n \nreply",

      "While I have been using Linux since 1996 or so, and do have quite an opinionated workflow, I never could agree with this kind of ultraconservative approach to things. History never stops. Things change. Linux changes. Not every day, not every month, but every couple of years something has to go. And that's ok.\n \nreply",
      "That isn't console. That is X11. I've known people who avoided that and who did not use GUI. Or maybe framebuffer (occasionally!). When I use Linux, I use Wayland. You say i3wm? I say SwayWM. Even if you were insisting on X11, there was QubesOS. And, there was a time when being conservative in Unix-land meant you did not run Linux. Or you sticked to Unix instead of WinNT. It is and always will be two steps forward, one step back. Case in point: Wayland, QubesOS.\n \nreply",
      "I agree. At some point in the past Unix was also new. There is a time for stability, but also time for changes. In fact, the most popular distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch largely operate on the principles that have not changed since the 90s. There is definitely a space to do things better now. I'm personally excited about GNU Guix, I think is one of the most innovative distributions, just on the basis of its consistency alone. They use a single programming language to implement all aspects of the OS: configuration, system services, packaging. NixOS is obviously another notable one, though it is not as tightly integrated because it still relies systemd and the nix language is quite arcane to use.\n \nreply",
      "> They use a single programming language to implement all aspects of the OS: configuration, system services, packaging.I can understand the appeal of the idea, but this feels like a significant mistake. It would be like an automaker saying, \"We are using exclusively 17 mm bolts for fasteners.\" Sure, it saves you time with finding a wrench. But I can't begin to imagine the number of compromises or additional complexities you introduce this way.It seems like a goal founded in an academic ideal rather than a design benefiting from engineering practicalities.\n \nreply",
      "I totally understand the concern but I think that it\u2019s well within reason that your analogy overstates the issue. I haven\u2019t given it all that much thought, but to me it seems reasonable that there are enough different use cases that are similar enough to still get a net benefit from a shared language. How much of this language fragmentation is just a reflection of Linux ecosystem fragmentation as opposed to e.g. \u201cthe right tool for each job\u201d?    I\u2019d bet a fair bit.\n \nreply",
      "> History never stops. Things change. Linux changes.To the better, right? Right? The last two years yielded so horrible regressions to me that I'm again considering giving up on Linux.\n \nreply",
      "I am quite happy with endeavouros for the last couple of years, it even plays well with nvidia cards.  Having played with multiple distros from the point of installing the Ubuntu from the cds they used to send, I definitely feel things have improved a lot. And a sincere thanks to all  who\u2019ve pushed things forward.\n \nreply",
      "First, what distro are you on?Second, have you tried windows or macOS recently?\n \nreply",
      "Distro doesn't matter that much, its mostly the desktop environment (panels and settings), and kernel regressions. Like half of my thinkpad fleet now boots into a blank screen due to an regression in the Linux i915 driver.I used to run Alpine Linux on servers, decided i wanted to change to something less exotic and found that Debian is no less buggy. No idea how to go on.Windows is consistently worse, i haven't tried macOS as it is not really popular here.\n \nreply",
      "Try linux-lts. The latest \"stable\" releases of the kernel (since 6.10 onwards) have felt like they weren't tested at all, major regressions in every single version. I report them, but new problems keep coming. Never seen anything like that in two decades of being a mostly/only linux user.The lts is fine, no problems at all.\n \nreply"

      "Yes: you can notice this, for example, in the announcements they put out while the area around the Getty Villa evacuated and then burned, where they pointed out that non-emergency staff had evacuated.  Similarly, I think JPL always had (emergency) staff present, and their own firefighting resources.Having heard about wildfire policies for some high-profile institutions in fire-prone areas, they'll often have their own procedures, in coordination with local authorities, which may not involve evacuating when others do, and may involve people coming to the site when others are evacuating.\n \nreply",

      "Rose-tinted glasses are definitely a thing, as is nostalgia, and before I get into topics like the fact that UI/UX was actually scientifically better[0] back then, I'd like to take a moment to step back and consider what the author is actually implying.Yes, the world was centralised, and profit motives did exist. There was a time where it looked like AOL would legitimately kill the open web, and MSN was trying too at the same time. However; the early 00's were blessed with technological limitation.I distinctly remember the fact that IRC and the primitive forum systems we designed such that an identity tied to a real person was not something people felt the need to have.  To even care what a community thinks because ultimately there's quite literally another one just around the corner.The golden era of community creation was 2002-2004 (incidentally this is when my own IRC network formed). Because heavy handed moderation, power trips and so-on caused market pressures on moderation staff.Too heavy handed and authoritarian: you might kill your community.Not willing to stamp out toxic elements: you might kill your community.That's why we're nostalgic, because simpler times was a combination of:* more focused, human and often better moderation;* a deluge of communities where you could find a place; even if you were weird, like me - and;* an understanding that your identity was not important. \"On the internet, nobody know's you're a dog\".Yes, there were companies and profit seeking, the web itself was mired in proprietary plugins and jank standards. But there was an ease of hosting communities that is totally lost now.The best many of us can hope for these days, is a little carved out niche as a serf in a fiefdom.[0]: https://ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/courses/ICS104/course-notes/Micro...\n \nreply",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the moderation. Earlier internet had a much more self-selecting audience. Trolling was in its artisanal infancy and there weren\u2019t incentives to spam and scam people since you couldn\u2019t monetize on such things. State and other propaganda actors didn\u2019t take it as a serious platform, there weren\u2019t trillion dollar companies monetizing your every move, and a hundred other variables\n \nreply",
      "Usenet pre-\"green-card-spam\" was a relative utopia.Sure you had arguments. That's where 'flamewar' came from. But quickly people tired of that and created *.advocacy sub-newsgroups to let people vent in their corner of the net.Then domains were opened up for commerce a few years later and eternal September became a thing... The net never recovered, it just used up more bandwidth.\n \nreply",
      "In that era also, the communities you had to chose from were higher quality, simply due to the barrier to entry of being always online.To continue with IRC as an example, having access to a shell account where you could set up a bouncer to lurk 24/7 in your channels was simply beyond the grasp of most people.So the people you had available to create communities with were those who were invested in keeping things nice. Why bother with all that overhead only to read shitpost memes and rage bait?Today the default mode for everyone is to be always online. It\u2019s actually harder to disconnect now. The quality of the communities reflects this.\n \nreply",
      "> To continue with IRC as an example, having access to a shell account where you could set up a bouncer to lurk 24/7 in your channels was simply beyond the grasp of most people.Still is. IRC is much the same as it has ever been.\n \nreply",

      "Heh yeah and irc wasnt exactly filled with upstanding honorable citizens either.\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019m not sure there wasnt as much spam and scams back then. I fondly remember 99% of my AOL inbox was filled with porn\u2026But ppl were definitely much more open and trustworthy back then. You could start a conversation with any random stranger and they wouldnt immediately dismiss you as some sort of scammer. Try that today and people will immediately flag you as a scammer\n \nreply",
      "It is not in human nature to scale their communities/tribes. Case in point, the continuous wars. It was foolish of humans on the early Internet to perceive ideas of forming large scale communities (business and ego motivations did that). If psychologists and anthropologists were techies and influencers of early Internet, we wouldn't have built such experiences in the first place.Humans thrive in small scale and close knit communities. Unfortunately, Internet was not built for such ideas. It will take a while for the original intent of the social media to die out. First, the ego will have to subside. Then, the business motivations would need to shift to something other than profiting off the human communication (did anyone care to throw Ads on the old fashioned telephone lines? Or tag an Ad inside our snail mail? No). When the humanity reaches such proportion of correction for the sake of Internet, we might come back to our senses.\n \nreply",
      "I think you can put the point to even the least tech savvy that the group chat is maybe the best iteration of the social internet. Because the groups are small, self moderated and independent. I guess the irony is that it relies on tech is/was provided by mobile phones already. Maybe all the more important that we don't allow texting to be wholly absorbed or replaced by closed messaging apps.\n \nreply"

A large part of the public is too young to have used these technologies, but they know what these devices and websites were used for. Even they associate them with a time when virtual spaces were more welcoming, fun and habitable.

Millennials have been adults for years, and they might now be making up for lost time by evoking hours spent chatting on MSN Messenger (they weren\u2019t all that exciting: you used to talk to your classmates right after you\u2019d been with them) and looking up movies and songs by Evane"
