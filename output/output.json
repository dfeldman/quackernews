      "GitHub's SAML implementation is useless. The idea is that you can bring your own account into an enterprise, and that sort of works on the site itself, but it does not prevent apps where you log in with GitHub from reading your organization membership once you have authorized an app on the organization level (and if you didn't, it hides the membership from oauth tokens, so it has this capability!).A SAML session is only required if said app fetches data via a token obtained from that user - and in my glance around, this was almost never the case - SAST tools almost always use app instance tokens and are happy to show anyone with a GitHub account in your organization your code. Tailscale fixed this when I pointed it out, Sonarcloud told me to please don't tell anyone and GitHub took a few weeks to say this is totally expected behavior - when no vendor I told did, and their docs contradicted them.I swear, reporting security bugs is a thankless endeavor, even if you just randomly stumble over them.

      "I was having multiple ESP devices from different brands running totally different firmwares all drop out randomly when I switched to a new Asus wifi router.Came across even more 'work arounds'; No spaces in the SSID, disable IPv6 for the whole network even if the ESP ignores it. Thing is all of these settings would reboot the router and reconnect everything, so it would seemingly work until the next dropout.I found limiting them to 802.11g instead of connecting with 'n' stopped the dropouts for good. Even now I wouldn't say that is a cure-all and that any of these other recommendations don't work, I'd guess that each AP's firmware might have different conflicts with different devices.\n \nreply",
      "> If your network hardware allows it, you should pin the device to the closest one.In Wi-Fi it's always the client's choice on where to connect to at the end of the day and any hacks the APs try to do to steer clients are \"suggestions\" at best and \"signal ruiners for everyone\" at worst.You may be better off specifying which specific AP you want to connect to by specifying the BSSID argument in the WiFi.begin() call on the ESP32 side https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/libra...Alternatively, if you REALLY want to force it, the sanest way is to use a uniquely named IoT SSID on each AP so there would be no other option for those clients to choose to latch on to (and you can leave the other SSIDs shared for normal clients). E.g. \"IoT-1\", \"IoT-2\", \"IoT-3\" on 3 separate APs. It may clutter up device screens more when you list available networks but it's just visual because, as far as airtime, they all beacon just as often if the names are the same or not anyways.> From what people and the internet tell me you should set the band width on the 2.4 Ghz network that your boards use to 20 Mhz, not 40, not 60, and definitely not automatic.This is spot on in that 20 MHz is the ideal channel width on 2.4, doubly so for just an ESP32. Some things to add are I'd say it should apply to any of your 2.4 GHz networks unless you live out the sticks and really want to race a few extra mbps out at the fringe of your AP coverage (and even then the wider channel width is probably going to make your SNR worse even in the sticks). Also, I don't believe the ESP32 supports 60 MHz in the 2.4 GHz space at all (it's certainly not an option in the Wi-Fi standard).I'll also tack on that the ESP32-C6 can be worth springing for if these kinds of thing are a particular concern as it support Wi-Fi 6, which has a few enhancements for connecting lots of IoT devices without so much noise.\n \nreply",
      "Do you know of something that could get my Android tablet to switch between two AP's in my house?  When I change locations in the house, it will never change to the stronger one if it has even the weakest signal that it was connected to.  I can't find any Android app that tells the device to \"change to a new AP if it is stronger than the current one\".\n \nreply",
      "I haven't had an Android device for a number of years now but my guess is \"no\" from the device side unless you're going to go make your own custom firmware with Wi-Fi settings tweaked or newer Wi-Fi drivers which handle roaming better.If your router and device support 802.11 k/v/r it can help, most likely the AP does unless it's particularly ancient and Android has supported all of these since 8.0. Ironically, lowering the AP's power can help too (it'll cause the client to see the farther AP as weaker sooner) but obviously that lowers overall coverage at the same time... so it's a tradeoff unless you're willing to deploy more APs to make up for the lower power. Make sure you're restricting advertised rates from your AP to not include the slowest/oldest standards as well. That'll make the client less able to hold on as the connection gets weaker and weaker. Like the power recommendation, this means at the fringes of your coverage you'll get \"no connection\" rather than \"a bad connection\" but it'll make the overall airspace healthier.If nothing else works and you can't fix the client because you lack full control (or a reasonable way to update it) then you can still try falling back to steering clients via hints from the AP (if it supports it) just keep in mind it also may not work and also may cause problems with other devices which were working fine. Or you may get lucky, worth a shot if you've tried everything else first.As a note: My experience comes from designing and fixing enterprise wireless deployments so if there are any tricks specific to low AP count environments I would be somewhat ignorant of them. The same could be said if there are more easily accessible wireless controls in Android than I am familiar with as, if there are, I still couldn't use them as different guests walk in each day and they all need to work.\n \nreply",
      "Yes. The proven method is to A/restrict data rates to just high ones and B/lower the transmit power of your AP so that your devices can no longer maintain high enough data rates after a given point and are forced to disconnect. I am almost certain the run of the mill stock firmware does not offer you this option. Look into installing OpenWrt.Apart from that, OpenWrt now allows you to install and use usteer which offers a plethora of (802.11 standards-based) tools to manage client roaming from the AP side, including the APs exchanging information between themselves.\n \nreply",
      "Yes this is a skill issue.But Arduino ecosystem is full of superstition and bizarre hacks. It's cargo cult electronics. They will do anything to avoid reading documentation or writing robust code.Even the power saving recommendation here reeks of it. There is no effort to understand it.

      "> It disables the radio in between AP beacons, so unless there's a bug in the implementation it should have no noticeable impact to a quiet WiFi station other than saving a lot of power.Seems safe, but it probably depends on the clock being accurate, so it can wake up on time for the next beacon, and the clock frequency is likely sensitive to temperature and therefore power usage.If you're plugged into a wall wart, chances are the power savings aren't going to be too much; if it helps reliability (which should be easy to confirm), then it's likely worth paying a cent or two more a month.

      "Let me take this opportunity to post one of the best texts on Galois Theory I have read -- and I had to go through quite a few while preparing for a class.https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/Galois.pdfThe subject is developed very naturally and every idea is beautifully motivated. It begins with a quick one chapter intro of Arnold's proof of Abel-Ruffini.Richard Koch's home page (https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/) has other examples of his fantastic pedagogy.\n \nreply",
      "> It begins with a quick one chapter intro of Arnold's proof of Abel-Ruffini.The key to understanding/motivating Galois theory is Abel-Ruffini, which is a corollary of Galois. And the simplest way to understand that is Arnold's topological proof, which i learned about from this videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhpVSV6iCkoWatching that video and rolling it around in my head completely demystified Galois theory for me, years after literally 2 semesters of algebra in undergrad. Everything about normal subgroups and commutators and splitting fields and blah blah blah immediately became tangible and obvious. It should be a crime not teach this proof first.The coverage in Koch's book looks good too - lots of pictures - and funny enough it links to a different youtube video.Edit: copy-pasting notes I took from the video after watching.------The idea is to continuously perturb each of the coefficients of the polynomial along a loop (change each of them from their initial value such that they traverse a path that returns them to that initial value at the end of the path) and study what happens to the roots of the polynomial.Note, once all coefficients have returned to their original values the entire set of roots also returns to itself, but each root does not necessarily returns to its original value. In general you get a permutation of the set of roots and so in this way we get a mapping between loops of the coefficients and permutations of the roots.Also note, we can produce coefficient loops that map to any permutation of the roots by permutating the roots and \u201cwatching\u201d the coefficients.Hence, the way to prove Abel-Ruffini is to show that any expression involving the coefficients (ie formula for the roots in terms of the coefficients) returns to itself after the coefficients traverse their loops but the roots do not (and therefore the expression cannot capture all of the roots). For example, an immediate corollary of the construction of the mapping between loops of coefficients and roots is the fact that a general solution involving only -, +, \u00d7, \u00f7 is not possible; \n-, +, \u00d7, \u00f7 are all single-valued and therefore no composition thereof could produce multiple roots.\n \nreply",
      "There is indeed a deep connection between what is going on behind Arnold's proof and the classical Galois theory. But it needs quite a bit of sophistication to flesh out properly (not apparent in his famous lectures given to high school kids).

      "The flat-earth community is actually kind of fascinating.  Someone recently paid to fly some flat-earthers down to Antarctica to witness the 24-hour sun which is impossible under most flat-earth models [1].

The intellectual backflips that the flat-earth community are making to try to debunk this experiment is simultaneously fun and disturbing to watch.The easiest way to debunk the flat-earth model is simply to observe that that 1) the sun sets below the horizon and 2) this happens at different times in different locations.

(As a rule of thumb, the amount of bending is coincidentally nearly equal to the apparent size of the sun's disc, so as soon as the bottom edge appears to touch the horizon, that's the moment it has actually fully dropped below the horizon, and would be totally obscured  if the light were travelling in the straight line paths assumed by this article.)\n \nreply",

I had the unenviable position of working as a line cook and construction worker during the 90s and listened to the radio 6+ hours a day. It's actually fun to listen to those hits these days. There are so many songs that I've forgotten about that I would listen to over and over again before they were overtaken by a new hit. Superman, burning beds, seether (whatever that was), bands named after boxes and chairs, ten different Eddie Vedders with arms wide open...listening to them now brings back a lot of memories so it's hard to hate them today as much as I did then. I remember exactly where I was (sitting in the parking lot of a Shoney's in Charlottesville, VA) when I first heard Smells Like Teen Spirit. Typical FM radio before that was hair metal and classic rock.My favorite, though, was Seven Mary Three. I saw them in Virginia Beach in a bar with no air conditioning, it was miserable but they had some seriously catchy tunes. Less then a year later I was painting a high school in Orlando and the song Cumbersome came on the radio with the announcer stating \"can you believe these guys are unsigned???\".

      "One of my core memories as a kid was when I watched the Mr. Rogers' episode about how crayons were made[0]. I came home after my first week of 1st grade, Grandma making dinner in the kitchen, my Mom getting ready for work. On the days it rained, which were many in the PNW, I would spend my afternoons coloring and watching reruns of Mr. Rogers'. My Grandma had begun recording episodes of Mr. Rogers' to VHS when I was barely even a year old for me to watch when I was older.Still with the fresh smell of crayon and marker on my hands from school, I grabbed my blue tin cookie can full of crayons from my room, stopping by the gigantic office desk where our brand new Hewlett Packard computer and Deskjet 500 printer lived. Barely tall enough to reach the front paper hopper, I snagged a sheet of paper, sandwiching it between my index and middle fingers.I popped in the VHS, seated in front of our Magnavox with crayon tin and paper in hand. The episode began and a core memory was made. That distinct crayon smell in combination with that episode will always stay with me.I left software to become a grade school teacher last year and I have Mr. Rogers' and a shortlist of male teachers to thank for planting the seed of curiosity and play some decades ago.0. https://youtu.be/MWAhnVYUPZo?si=kdg7-iY0Wcd8IRne\n \nreply",

      "It really is amazing isn\u2019t it? I teach 4/5th grade where many in this cohort are behind in reading/writing due to the pandemic. It was an uphill battle to get the approval to incorporate AI in my lesson plans but admin quickly changed their tune after they saw the engagement and improvement in my students after using AI to generate images. While many of us adults, find prompting and chat based AI\u2019s cumbersome, it has been a boon for my student\u2019s writing skills. The tight feedback and reward loop text based image generation provides between what is nestled in their minds and what the AI creates is incredible.
