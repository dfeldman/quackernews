An i5 is a bit closer. Some 2024 Ryzen CPUs can match or exceed its multicore performance, but these are also more expensive and much less energy efficient. Pricewise, things start favoring PCs if you need more RAM, as Mac upgrades are costly.One can potentially use Nix on a Mac Mini to keep similar development environments to those used in Linux, but AFAIK some packages are not supported on ARM.

So it doesn't really matter if they're \"losing\" part of their margin on these online retail sales.(Or, if you think about it another way: this is essentially customer-driven price discrimination. Like coupons are for grocery stores. The discounted price is Apple's true price \u2014 the price that builds in a profit margin they're happy with. The higher price is pure gravy if they can convince people to part with it. They put the higher price front-and-center, and make the lower-priced offer a bit obscure.

None of that seemed incredibly difficult looking into it, but still, it was the type of recipe I was expecting when I saw \"Proxmox scripts\".And of course this means that the Proxmox box as a whole should have similar hardening to a typical web server, with minor tweaks to allow residential traffic on various other standard ports.

I wonder if a structured recipe format would be helpful to explore the \u2018solution space\u2019 of any given dish.For example, think of all the decisions required to specify a curry dish:How do you cut/mash your garlic and ginger and onions? (If you even add all of those ingredients)Do you use whole or ground spices? What about for each spice? Cardamom pods or ground cardamom?Do you toast each spice?How long do you cook your onions?And so on. Eventually you get to an absolutely gigantic amount of options that all generate a somewhat similar dish, but with key sensory differences. They may all be \u2018chicken tikka masala\u2019 but I\u2019d argue you\u2019d have a very different eating experience across that decision spectrum.I think this may also play (specifically for Indians) into the idea that moms is best. It\u2019s probably because mom\u2019s is universally unique and you crave that nostalgia.\n \nreply",
      "This is something I get (better ways at storing and using information.I like the of a list of ingredients with the quantity in the top and then repeated in the steps (if no quantity is mentioned in the steps its implied the whole ingredient is used).  This makes sense in that you may need to have on hand 3 tbs of butter but 2 get melted and mixed in step 3, and 1 is used to grease the pan in step 5.The next dimension would be a language/glossary of preparation terms (slice apple - how? radially or into x thickness sheets?)  This would be helpful for those without any clue on common actions and maybe later for automation.  Though cooking is way more an art than just a set of steps and standard unit quantities.With a glossary you could search for recipes that use grated apples or recipes that use a food processor, or don't use an oven, etc.Good \"food for thought\"  :-D\n \nreply",

      "Blaming all ills of any Japanese industry on the keiretsu is in vogue for decades, but at best, keiretsu is a symptom, not a cause, of the underlying risk-averse culture.  Keiretsu, even when they were toxically anti-competitive, did not go out of their ways to crush would-be global startups in Japan; keiretsu, by the author's own argument, didn't care about the global software-only market, thus would not kill those startups.  The true culprit, the risk-averse culture -- while with own merits -- did not mesh well with the more fluid flat culture of software development.It was not an accident that software did well in the most hippy region in the US, San Francisco.  On the contrary, hardware development, due to much more constraints from the laws of physics and economics, has been done well in Japan et al as careful top-down planning is the edge, not individual-level agility.*I am a little surprised that the author, who is active in Japan, is off the mark.  I regularly talk to many engineers/entrepreneurs in the region, and the cause-and-effect are quite easy to see and are unanimously agreed upon.  Kudos to people there who are trying to change the software development culture for the better.* Elon's ventures seem to challenge this conventional dichotomy as he attempts to bring both agility and top-down leadership into his firms.  More power to him.\n \nreply",
      "As a software engineer currently working in Japan, I fully agree with your comment.But I think it is not just the risk aversion, Japan is a very rigid country with an strong emphasis on following the hierarchy and rules, no matter how ridiculous they are, but introspection and critical thinking are not appreciated. This works well for industrial environments, but not for software development.\n \nreply",

      "Software tends to create winner takes it all markets, which means if you're a small fish wanting to get bigger you either need to create your own market, or get enough money to win over the other players.Keiretsu not caring about a market forces new comers to go for the blue ocean strategy, as they won't get investments for fighting in the more crowded markets.As the keiretsu also hold the capital, they also shape markets and should totally be blamed for what happens there.To compare to the US, Microsoft wouldn't be there if IBM didn't invest in it. Apple also benefited from Xerox and got saved by Microsoft etc.. That's the kind of dynamic the Japanese market only saw in cars and customer electronics manufacturing.\n \nreply",
      "> The true culprit, the risk-averse culture -- while with own merits -- did not mesh well with the more fluid flat culture of software development.Not even that. It's just about financing.Japan's domestic capital markets collapsed due to the Asset Bust in the early 1990s, the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, and the Great Recession in 2008-12, and domestic asset managers turbocharged the \"Flying Geese\" development model in order to make themselves whole.There's no reason for an Asset Manager at SoftBank, Nomura, or MUFG to invest in a Japanese startup when a South Korean, Chinese, Indian, or Singaporean startup can command outsized returns in an IPO or Acquisition.Japanese asset managers play a major role in Tech VC/PE in Asia, but they prefer to invest abroad.Look at the outsized returns from Alibaba (SoftBank), Flipkart (SoftBank), and Grab (MUFG) compared to anything that came out of Japan in the last 30 years.> but at best, keiretsu is a symptomSouth Korea and China both use the same corporate model that Keiretsus use, as much of the reform era leadership in both SK and China studied in Japan, and both countries got significant technical and economic advising from Japan via the \"Flying Geese\" model\n \nreply",

      "This seems like the start of something handy, but isn't yet useful.\nAs others have mentioned, which holidays a company offers will vary.\nBut more than that, given a number of days off and a calendar year, this currently seems to output only 1 result, though of course there are a large number of ties (in terms of consecutive days not worked). The current tool doesn't allow the user to 'edit' or swap between 'equally good' allocations. In my attempt, it produced a very skewed result, using the vast majority of days between November and February, and using zero days in July through October. If it suggests using 4 days to extend a holiday into 9 consecutive days, there's no way to express that you'd rather do that for Labor Day than for Veterans day. If it's extending a 3-day weekend into a 4-day one, you can't indicate that you'd rather do that with Columbus Day than with Presidents Day.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for your feedback! Indeed the algorithm only gives one result, as it tries to fill all gaps from smallest to biggest in the best way possible to create clusters.Making it super customisable would be tough, as then it becomes just a personal calendar.

      "Looks like it doesn't handle year transitions nicely?In NSW Australia, it shows 11 days between Dec 21 and Dec 31, but Jan 1 is a public holiday here and you capsule add Jan2&3 plus the following weekend to get 16 days 21 Dec 2024 through 5 Jan 2025.\n \nreply",

For example, if I have 10 days off + 13 public holidays, the website shows all combinations to maximise the number of days off work.\n \nreply",
      "This is pretty cool. I've organically done something similar for many years (i.e. tried to optimize leave to coincide with public holidays to get those extra long weekends.)If you think it would be fun, maybe you could expose different algorithm choices for how to allocate the blocks?Eg, I don't necessarily need to maximize the block lengths, but would like the holidays to be more evenly spread through the year. At the moment, it gives me a huge block around the easter period and another one week block later in the same month. And then, there are no holidays for an entire six months from the end of May to the start of November, despite several public holidays in between! I suggest an alternative algorithm would seek fewer one-week blocks and more long-weekend blocks, with some sort of pressure which penalizes blocks for being too close together?\n \nreply",

      "I'd like to engage in the discussion the article raises about why teams don't hire for this role.So, I have actually tried to hire for this role. Multiple times.The reality is that I got an order of magnitude fewer applications of an order of magnitude lower quality when I've tried to describe this role, as compared to when I just put the standardized \"front end engineer\" title in the role.So instead I tried to just sift through the \"front end engineer\" applicants to find people with design sensibilities. But this also yielded poor results. After reviewing at least a thousand applicants, I found one or two people with this combination of skillsets, and one of them to whom I made an offer ended up going with a different firm.Senior engineers in our team said things like \"I think you're searching for a unicorn that doesn't exist\" and \"people just don't mix the right-brained and left-brained skills.\"After trying so hard, I just accepted that and decided to work with dedicated designers and dedicated engineers. Each are good at what they do.But our web experience is definitely lacking for lack of someone in this role. Right now, this week, I'm trying to fill the gap as I can do a little bit of both. Everyone on our team feels like we need some \"glue\" to tie our experiences together well. But a designer can't make it happen and a pure engineer can't imagine what to do without very explicit detailed designs / instructions. It's so much more effective for one person to at once understand how the code needs to function, what helps the user, and have design sensibility to make the form 'function' w/r/t cognitive overload and intuition. Things get lost in communication without someone who can understand all three. But there's no one I feel I can truly delegate this to completely on our product team.What have the experiences been of other people who have hired and built product teams?\n \nreply",
      "I can't really speak to the hiring side, but... I'm a devops engineer who went to art school. I rarely get to exercise my design skills at my day job, sadly.We exist. There just aren't many of us.\n \nreply",
      "A few times in my career I've been looking for exactly this role, a place that would value sense and design/ux sensibility as well as an understanding of what is technically possible. Larger companies don't hire for this role, because it does not have a name. You could write \u201cTemple Grandin for the web\u201d, but that is closer to magic, something non-scalable, a position that is created for a specific person. I ended up working in small teams, often in experimental research positions, but that too is very special and esoteric.If the role had a name, not even a theoretical foundation but simply a name, then and only then it could actually exist.\n \nreply",
      "If you can't hire for it but you have solid raw materials, slowly bringing the front-end dev closer to the customer can bridge some of that gap.It's not going to get you to some bauhaus ideal overnight, but it might start to click for them in a way that leaves you better off than you are today.\n \nreply"

My conclusion from this reflection is that teams generally don't hire for the work I really like, with some rare exceptions. This is why I almost always end up carving out my own space.Whenever I join a team, regardless of what the job description said, I fall into filling the gaps between design and engineering. It's always where I've loved working. It's the space I seek out even if no one asked me to. The front-of-the-front end work (I'll probably never stop referencing this article) that is always neglected but never hired for specifically to solve. Even when it's painfully obvious it's missing. This usually includes accessibility, UI design, some basic UX consulting, and of course, actual UI development; you know, writing HTML, CSS and JS.I've written before about why teams don't hire for this role, or at least "

      "So these addition formulas that apply to series and parallel resistors seem more generally to be formulas for finding the new ratio when you have several ratios and want to add them together treating the quantity in the numerator or the denominator as equal for all ratios. Series circuits have the same current for each ratio, and differing voltages, while parallel circuits have the same voltage for each ratio and a different current for each.

I am a heavy email user, so connecting chatgpt to my inbox was obvious to me.

So having label recommendations could save a lot of time. Or proposed new filters based on common obvious labeling activity already occurring in my inbox.\n \nreply",

      "From the conclusions:> I find that AI substantially boosts materials discovery, leading to an increase in patent filing and a rise in downstream product innovation. However, the technology is effective only when paired with sufficiently skilled scientists.I can see the point here. Today I was exploring the possibility of some new algorithm. I asked Claude to generate some part which is well know (but there are not a lot of examples on the internet) and it hallucinated some function. In spite of being bad, it was sufficiently close to the solution that I could myself \"rehallucinate it\" from my side, and turn it into a creative solution. Of course, the hallucination would have been useless if I was not already an expert in the field.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, I have experienced it, too. I was building a web crawler using Replit as an agent. I could have done that in 2 hours without LLM help but I wanted to see how the LLM would do it.

It is not the best but also not the worst experience.\n \nreply",
      "I came to the same conclusion a while back. LLMs are very useful when user expertise level is medium to high, and task complexity is low to medium.
