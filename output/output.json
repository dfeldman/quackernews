      "Love all of these tips. I've hosted dozens of events since moving to NYC and figured I'd add 5 more:1. If this is a dinner party (or people are all seated), force people to get up and move in a way that they'll meet new people. Do this when you're about 2/3 of the way through the party. Some will complain - do it anyway.2. Plan 1 (ideally 2) interludes. It can be a small speech, moving people around, changing locations, having people vote on something, etc. For whatever reason, they make the night more memorable.3. Do your best to make introductions natural and low-pressure. Saying things like \"you two would really get along\" can put pressure on people - especially shy ones. Bring up something they have in common and let them chat while you back away.4. Go easy on folks who cancel last minute. They often don't feel good about doing it and you don't want to add more stress to them or yourself.5. More music != more fun. Some music is good, but if people can't hear each other, turn it down.If you're interested reading more about this stuff, read The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker.reply",

Now you'll be be expected to throw another party next year.What you should do is throw the kind of party where your guest wake up several days from now and call their lawyers to find out if they've been indicted for anything.  You want your guests to be so anxious to avoid a recurrence of your party that they immediately start planning parties of their own, a year in advance, just to prevent you from having another one.If your party is successful, the police will knock on your door, unless your party is very successful in which case they will lob tear gas through your living room window.

This will limit the appeal of the community to people like the ones currently there and will make sure that it never grows too big.Thus your community is as appetising to activists attempting a hostile takeover as a toxic slug is to a bird.As an example from six years ago, when the code of conduct madness had just reached its peak:>I believe OpenBSD's code of conduct can be summed up as \"if you are the type of person who needs a code of conduct to teach to you how to human then you are not welcome here\".reply",

      "Dependent types are very useful for some things. For example, I wish Python had the ability to express \"a 10 x 5 matrix of float32s\" as a type, and typecheck that.The Curry-Howard correspondence, using dependent type system to have \"proofs\" be equivalent to \"types\", is powerful, but it can be really confusing. From a human point of view, there is a huge difference between \"Your proof is wrong\" and \"You wrote a statement that fails typechecking\".Intuitively, when you make an error with types, it should be something fairly trivial that you just read the error and fix it up. When you make an error in a proof, it's understandable if it's very complicated and requires thought to fix. The natural UI is different.So I agree with the author that the greatest benefit of Lean is not its typesystem per se, but its community. Specifically the fact that Lean's library of mathematics, mathlib, is organized like an open source community with pull requests. Whereas Isabelle's library of mathematics, the AFP, is organized like a scientific journal with referees.I'm working on a dependent type system at the moment for a new theorem prover - Acorn, at https://acornprover.org - and my hope is to combine the good points of both Lean and Isabelle. It's nice that Lean has the power to cleanly express the simple dependent types that mathematicians often use, like vector spaces or quotients. But if you use dependent types too much then it does get complicated to debug what's happening.reply",
      "> For example, I wish Python had the ability to express \"a 10 x 5 matrix of float32s\" as a typeTo clarify, as long as 5 and 10 are constants, this is entirely possible in C++ and Rust^1, neither of which are dependently typed (or at most are dependently typed in a very weak sense). In general, neither can ensure at compile time that an index only known at runtime is in bounds, even if the bounds themselves are statically known. A proper dependently-typed language can prevent runtime out-of-bound errors even if neither the indices nor the bounds are known at type check time.^1 And weakly in many other languages whose builtin array types have compile-time bounds. But C++ and Rust let user-defined generic types abstract over constant values.reply",
      "You can do that in python using https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchtypinglooks like this:    def batch_outer_product(x:   TensorType[\"batch\", \"x_channels\"],\n                            y:   TensorType[\"batch\", \"y_channels\"]\n                            ) -> TensorType[\"batch\", \"x_channels\", \"y_channels\"]:\n\n    return x.unsqueeze(-1) * y.unsqueeze(-2)\n\nThere's also https://github.com/thomasahle/tensorgrad which uses sympy for \"axis\" dimension variables:    b, x, y = sp.symbols(\"b x y\")\n    X = tg.Variable(\"X\", b, x)\n    Y = tg.Variable(\"Y\", b, y)\n    W = tg.Variable(\"W\", x, y)\n    XWmY = X @ W - Yreply",

      "> In general, neither can ensure at compile time that an index only known at runtime is in bounds, even if the bounds themselves are statically known.Yeah, this seems like matrixes might not be a great first example for explaining the value of dependent types. It's fully possible to define a matrix that uses a generic type as the index for each dimension that doesn't allow expressing values outside the expected range; it would just be fairly cumbersome, and the usual issues would creep back in if you needed to go from \"normal\" integers back to indexes (although not if you only needed to convert the indexes to normal integers).I find that the potential utility of dependent types is more clear when thinking about types where the \"dimensions\" are mutable, which isn't usually how I'd expect most people to use matrixes. Even a simple example like \"the current length of a list can be part of the type, so you define a method to get the first element only on non-empty lists rather than needing them to return an optional value\". While you could sort of implement this in a similar as described above with a custom integer-like type, the limitations of this kind of approach for a theoretically unbounded length are a lot more apparent than a matrix with constant-sized dimensions.reply",
      "The advantage of dependent typing systems is that you can say that the arguments to a matrix multiplication function must have dimensions (m, i) and (i, n) and that result will have dimensions (m, n).reply",
      "Yes, the point of dependent types is that they give you the ability to do some sort of almost arbitrary (though not strictly Turing-complete) \"computation\" as part of type checking, which essentially dispenses with the phase separation between \"compiling\" and \"running\" code - or at least makes compile-time computation unusually powerful. So if you want to replicate the properties of dependent typing in these existing languages you'll need to leverage their existing facilities for compile-time metaprogramming.> A proper dependently-typed language can prevent runtime out-of-bound errors even if neither the indices nor the bounds are known at type check time.Yes, but the way this is done is by threading a proof \"this index is within bounds\" throughout the code.  At runtime (e.g. within 'extracted' code, if you're using common dependently-typed systems), this simply amounts to relying on a kind of capability or ghost 'token' that attests to the validity of that code.  You \"manufacture\" the capability as part of an explicit runtime check when needed (e.g. if the \"index\" or \"bounds\" come from user input) and simply rely on it as part of the code.reply",
      "You can do arbitrary computations as part of type checking in C++, yet I don't think it should be considered dependently typed.It seems to me that dependent typing strictly requires going from runtime values to types.(You can parametrize types by runtime values in c++ in a trivial sense, by enumerating a finite set a compile time and then picking the correct type at runtime according to a runtime value, still I don't think it counts as the set of valid types would be finite).reply",
      "The \"runtime\" values of a dependent type system are not quite runtime values either, because the computation is happening at compile time. When you \"extract\" a program from a dependently-typed to an ordinary programming language that can compile down to a binary, the dependent types are simply erased and replaced with ordinary, non-dependent types; though there may be \"magic\" casts in the resulting program that can only be proven correct via dependent types.reply"

      "I'm curious why Lisp didn't gain mass popularity despite its advantages. In fact, I was wondering if it's popularity has event decreased in the past decade or so. I remember in the 2000s and even early 2010s, there were active discussion on Clojure, Scheme, and functional/logic programming in general. There seems much less discussion or usage nowadays. One theory is that popular languages have absorbed many features of functional programming, so the mainstream programmers do not feel the need to switch. My pet theory is that many of us mortals get the productivity boost from the ecosystem, in particular powerful libraries and frameworks. Given that, the amazing features of lisp, such as its s-expression, may not be powerful enough to sway users to switch.reply",
      "It occurred to me this morning that I should learn Clojure instead of Rust for non-lowlevel code because Clojure solves the same problems Rust solves in a much simpler way. I'm a fan of Clojure author Rich Hickey's \"Simple Made Easy\" talk but otherwise don't know either language in detail and need to do more research.reply",
      "The Clojure (or any Lisp) journey is very different, not because of the language per se, but because of the developer experience.In Clojure, there's no appreciable compilation time.\nDuring my work week I barely, if ever, restart the application I'm working on: I'm working inside of it via a REPL connection.It's an entirely different ball game and if you just compare language features you are missing out on an incredible interactive coding experience.reply",
      "> Clojure solves the same problems Rust solves in a much simpler wayI'm curious about that, can you elaborate?  I'm a beginner in Clojure and I only know a few concepts about Rust, but it seems to me that they solve (at least, currently) very different problems...I only saw Rust being used in places where C or C++ would be used in the past (Linux kernel, CLI apps, desktop apps), while I only saw Clojure being used as a modern and functional Java and JS replacement.Not to mention how different they are as languages (static vs dynamic typing, native vs jvm, borrow checker vs garbage collection)reply",
      "The main problem that Rust tries to solve, and that functional programming (which Clojure heavily leans into) solves, is avoiding shared mutable state, which leads to data races and (potentially subtly) wrong concurrent programs. Functional programming avoids shared mutable state by avoiding mutable state. Operations are only represented as transformations instead of mutations. Other languages like Erlang / Elixir use message passing techniques like the Actor Model to avoid shared mutability. Instead of avoiding mutability, like in functional programming, in the Actor Model you avoid sharing, by instead sending messages around.Rust is interesting because it solves the problem of shared mutable state, while allowing sharing, and allowing mutability, just not at the same time. State can be mutated until it is shared. While it is shared, it cannot be mutated. This is the goal of the ownership system in Rust.reply",
      "One thing that jumped out at me is you don't need Rust's borrow checker to prevent thread race conditions because data in Clojure is immutable. That's a huge simplification over Rust. What I hear mostly about Rust is complaints about the borrow checker. I wrote a simple Rust utility and found it frustrating. But again, don't take my word for it because I don't know either language.reply",
      "As someone who has gone deep into both functional programming (with Elixir, Clojure, and Scala) and also Rust, they solve the same problem in different ways with different tradeoffs.The problem is that shared mutable state is incredibly hard to get correct, especially when concurrency enters the picture.Elixir and Clojure sidestep the problem by making copying data so cheap that instead of sharing references to mutable data, you make all data immutable and copy it whenever you want to change it in some way. (Which is a classic technique: don\u2019t like the problem? Solve a different problem that sidesteps the original problem in a creative way)So you have a lot of functions of roughly the shape `f -> f` (return a new thing) instead of `f -> ()` (mutate a thing in place).This possible at all by the clever use of some novel data immutable structures like HAMTs that are able to approximate the performance of traditional mutable data structures like hashmaps or arrays while presenting an immutable API.As it turns out, this is a much easier programming model for most of us to get correct in practice (especially in the presence of concurrency) than sharing mutable state in an imperative programming language like C or Java or Python.The tradeoff is that the immutable functional data structures actually do have a some performance overhead. In most domains it's not large enough to matter, but in some domains it is, and in those domains you really do need mutable state to eek out that last bit of performance.Which is where Rust comes in.In Rust's model, data can either mutable or shared, but not both at the same time. The Rust compiler computes the lifetimes of data throughout your program to ensure that this invariant is upheld, so mutable data is not shared, and shared data is not mutated.The downside of this is that you have to internalize these rules and program to them. They can be tough to learn and tough to program with even after you have learned them, though it does get much easier with experience, I will say.The upside of Rust's model is that you can have your cake and eat it too: you can keep the high performance ceiling of a true mutable data model while maintaining memory and resource safety.In short, you can think of Clojure/Elixir as sidestepping the shared mutability problem at the cost of some runtime performance (though again in practice it is smaller than you would think), and Rust as tackling the shared mutability problem head on by transferring the cost of solving the problem to a more complicated compiler and a harder-to-learn programming model.These are just my opinions having used both Rust and the immutable data functional programming stuff in anger. I'm not trying to present one as being better than the other, the key point is that they're both better than what came before.reply",
      "It's worth noting that there's several implementations of persistent/immutable/functional data structures for Rust already, and a few basic \"building blocks\" (namely std::borrow::Cow, noted for its bovine superpowers) are even in the Rust standard library.  It's possible that we'll see more of them standardized in the future if a case can be made that they're useful and a consensus is reached wrt. some kind of minimally viable APIs.reply",
      "My read today is that the advantage of Rust over C/C++ is that the compiler enforces the rules, where in C/C++ you'd have to use a static source code analyzer to find omissions. Since Clojure uses Software Transactional Memory and Persistant Data Structures to only make copies of updated shared data structures, it seems like it could actually be faster than Rust/C/C++ depending on how efficient the copy is. I may have it wrong but it sure is interesting...reply",
      "I would argue that F# would be the choice of language in place of Rust if you don't want to deal with Rust's type system. F# is immutable by default with good concurrency and a static type system.reply"

This could be how long you keep transaction logs for, or how long rows are tombstoned for, etc. The longer the time period, the costlier it usually is, in total storage cost and sometimes performance too. So you have to compromise with where you set the time period for.Let's imagine that the process usually takes 1 minute and the tombstones are kept for 1 day. It would take something ridiculous to make the thing that usually takes 1 minute take longer than a day - not worth even considering. But sometimes there are a confluence of events that make such a thing possible... For example, maybe the top of rack switch died. The server stays running, it just can't succeed any upstream calls. Maybe it is continuously retrying while the network is down (or just slowly timing out on individual requests and skipping to the next one to try it). When the network comes back up, those calls start succeeding but now it's so much staler than you ever even thought was possible or planned for.

These can be exceeded, and it's not reasonable for every piece of software in the chain to invent a new way to store time, or counters, etc.I've seen a fair share of issues resulting from processes with uptime of over 1 year and some with uptime of 5 years. Of course the wisdom there is just \"don't do that, you should restart for maintenance at some point anyway\" which is true, but it still means we are living with a system that theoretically will break after a certain period of time, and we are sidestepping that by restarting the process for other purposes.reply",

It's mind-boggling and actually insulting as a user.

While I agree this might be a problem in some scenarios, I think there are many others where that is not the case, as copied URLs tend to be short-lived (bookmarks and \"browser history\" are an exception), mostly used for refreshing a page (which will later be closed) or for sharing . In the remaining cases, you can always plug in some code to migrate from the old URL to the new URL when loading, which will actually solve the issue if you got there via browser history (won't fix for bookmarks though).reply",
      "While I like this approach as well, these URLs ending up in the browser history isn\u2019t ideal. Autocomplete when just trying to go to the site causes some undesired state every now and then. Maybe query params offer an advantage over paths here.reply",
      "I think it\u2019s a \u201cuse the right tool for the job\u201d thing. Putting ephemeral information like session info in URLs sucks and should only be done if you need to pass it in a get request from a non-browser program or something, and even then I think you should redirect or rewrite the url or something after the initial request. But I think actual navigational data or some sort of state if it\u2019s in the middle of an important action is acceptable.But if you really just want your users to be able to hit refresh and not have their state change for non-navigational stuff like field contents or whatever, unless you have a really clear use case where you need to maintain state while switching devices and don\u2019t want to do in server-side, local storage seems like the idiomatic choice.reply",
      "JS does have features for editing the history, but it's a trade-off of not polluting the history too much while still letting the user navigate back and forthreply",
      "I'm glad to see that prismjs site mentioned by the blog is doing the right thing - when it updates the URL, it replaces the current history item.reply",
      "Does that handle back button correctly? Nothing more annoying that sites/apps that overwrites the history incorrectly, so when you press the back button it goes to the entry before you entered the website/app, rather than back into what you were doing in the website/app.Both approaches (appending/rewriting) have their uses, the tricky part is using the right thing for the right action, fuck up either and the experience is abysmal.reply",
      "It\u2019s definitely possible to make a really stellar experience, but that winds up being the exception. The URL and history state are sort of \u201cinvisible\u201d elements of the user experience but require thoughtful care and attention to what the user expects/wants at each step, a level of attention which is already a rarity in web development even in the most visible parts of a page\u2026so frequently the history/back button stuff just totally sucks.reply",
      "Yeah, in my experience you only get great stuff when both product and engineering has equal care for the final experience. If either parties lack care, you'll miss stuff, particularly things that are \"invisible\" as you say.reply",
      "It's pretty weird, my impression is that the APIs are flexible enough to implement most sane behaviors, but websites keep managing to mess it all up. Perhaps it's just one of those things that no one bothers re-testing as the codebase changes.reply",
      "In my experience, the problem is two-fold. First product managers/owners don't consider the URIs, so it ends up not being specified. They say \"We should have a page when user clicks X, and then on that page, user can open up modal Y\", but none of it is specified in terms of what happens with the URIs and history.Then a developer gets the task to create this, and they too don't push back on what exact URIs are being used, nor how the history is being treated. Either they don't have time, don't have the power to send back tasks to product, simply don't care or just don't think of it. They happily carry along creating whatever URIs make sense to them.No one is responsible for URLs, no one considers that part of UX and design, so no one ends up thinking about it, people implement things as they feel is right, without having a full overview over how things are supposed to fit together.Anyways, that's just based on my experience, I'm sure there are other holes in the process that also exacerbates the issue.reply"

(Bonus points if you have any Tcl/Tk apps running, where you can simply transmit commands for the program to run via the X server.)reply",
      "There are plenty of setups where the X server runs at higher privileges/on a different host than the (partially trusted) application that might exploit the X server. This is a classic elevation of privileges vulnerability in those setups.X11's practical absence of any security mechanisms for user sessions means you should probably not run any kind of low-trust UI program anyway, as there is no prevention of keystroke injection or screen recording, but that's a design flaw that will never be solved. That doesn't mean that EoP style attacks like these should be ignored or underestimated, though.reply",
      "Why do people keep persisting this myth? X11 has authentication. You can either rely on filesystem permissions, or a shared secret. The same way thousands of other network servers work.Any program you run on a computer (especially a Linux computer, which lacks modern OS security measures and has constant privesc kernel holes) exposes you to security flaws. There has yet to be any computer system designed that a hacker can't break out of. If you intentionally download and execute a program, you are rolling the dice, regardless of what the software is.What's insane about all these discussions is that NOBODY IS HACKING X SERVERS. There's a thousand other kinds of software on Linux that there is real malware for. But nobody is trying to hijack your X11 session. This imagined threat is a red herring designed to bolster the argument for Wayland's horrible designs.reply",

It makes no sense whatsoever to leave one open just because.reply",
      "I think the point being made isn't that X.org shouldn't fix their vulnerabilities. It's that there's always a huge amount of discussion about vulnerabilities and security models when one is found in the display server or the window manager when actual exploitation doesn't seem to be particularly high.Many distros, if not most distros, disable port 6000+ listening for X.org by default. So, immediately, it's not a remote exploit. OK, so it's scope is already limited to local escalation attacks. Looking at the CVE, the only reason it's high is because (a) X.org is everywhere, (b) you don't need to interact with [another] user to exploit it, and (c) it's not particularly complex to exploit.That is bad, but it's also behind most of the other security, rather than bypassing essentially all of it like Heartbleed or Shellshock.So, either I have to have X forwarding turned back on, or have people with SSH access to a server that is also running X. Both of those seem like uncommon situations. You probably shouldn't be running X or permitting X to be started unless you need X forwarding, and X forwarding is a pretty odd requirement given modern application design being so web-browser-focused.So it might be CVE High 7+ if you're on a system where it's possible to exploit it. But it feels like you shouldn't often be on a system configured in a way where it could be exploited in spite of the prevalence of X.Essentially: This isn't a rehash of the libXfont problem.reply",
      "But there is no vulnerability at all. For a normally configured X server with TCP listening, the server should be configured to use MIT magic cookies for authentication. This randomly-generated string is needed to authenticate and establish a connection to the X server. You can use the xauth command to manually configure it as needed.It's the equivalent of HTTP Digest authentication, and nobody's demanding that we rewrite HTTP because Digest authentication. It's in plaintext, so you shouldn't use it; but if a hacker doesn't know the secret, they can't get in.reply",

If I want to leave it fully unlocked,  that's my business,  and I possibly have good environmental reasons to do this.What you should really care about are security _defaults_.

      "US federal regulations are full of laws that take something minor or completely legal, and add huge punishments because someone used technology.  All the way back in 1952, fraud punishments were worse if someone used a telephone to commit fraud.  In 1982 the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act added even more punishment, if someone used a computer.Fraud is bad, and it should be illegal, but why have different punishments based on what technology someone used?Laws like this go outside of fraud, and often are clearly unconstitutional, like the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which made lawful gambling illegal too, until it was effectively overturned with Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2018.reply",
      ">but why have different punishments based on what technology someone used?So first as foundation, I see no reason to pretend that the law is always perfectly thought through and logical particularly when it comes to crime. And even when laws have been done for the time, that also doesn't mean circumstances haven't changed over the decades while the law remained static.That said, in principle punishment embodies multiple components and a major aspect is deterrence. The deterrence value in turn interplays with components like barrier to entry, scaling of the potential harm and the likelihood of getting caught. Usage of technology can have a significant impact on all of this. It's significantly more challenging and expensive to prosecute crimes that stretch across many jurisdictions, technology can also have a multiplier effect allowing criminal actors to go after far more people, both in terms of raw numbers and in terms of finding the small percentage of the vulnerable, and perceived anonymity/impunity can further increase number of actors and their activity levels. It also has often implied a higher degree of sophistication.All of that weighs towards a higher level of punishment even as pure game theory. That doesn't mean the present levels are correct or shouldn't be only a part of other aspects of fighting fraud that depressingly frequently get neglected, but it's not irrational to punish more when criminals are generating more damage and working hard to decrease the chance of facing any penalties at all.reply",
      "You have to levers to enforce law. You can get better at catching lawbreakers or punish those that are caught harder. There are studies that show that catching a higher percentage of criminals and punishing them in a timely fashion leads to lower crime than punishing those you do catch harder. Europe in general has more police officers per capita and higher conviction rates that happen more timely. The US on the other hand spends more on prisons and has her officers. I think this is partially cultural and due to how responsibilities and finance are set up between local, state and federal government in the US.Fraud via phone or computer is harder to catch.

      "The big problem with CFAA isn't particular to CFAA at all; it's that it shares the 2B1.1 loss table with all the other federal criminal statutes, and computers are very good and very fast at running the number on that table up. It's a real problem and I'm not pushing back on the idea that something should change about it, but I wouldn't characterize the problem the way you do, as the law singling out crimes involving computers.Part of the history of CFAA was that it was passed because the state of the law preceding it didn't comfortably criminalize things like malicious hacking and denial of service; you can do those things without tripping over wire fraud.reply",
      "> it's that it shares the 2B1.1 loss table with all the other federal criminal statutes, and computers are very good and very fast at running the number on that table up.That's a problem with it, but another big one is that it's inherently ambiguous.The normal way you know if you're authorized to do something with a computer is that it processes the request. They're perfectly capable of refusing; you get \"forbidden\" or \"access denied\" but in that case you're not actually accessing it, you're just being informed that you're not allowed to right now. So for there to be a violation the computer would have to let you do something it isn't supposed to. But how are you supposed to know that then?On a lot of websites -- like this one -- you go to a page like https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=<user_id> and you get the user's profile. If you put in your user there then you can see your email address and edit your profile etc. If the server was misconfigured and showing everyone's email address when it isn't supposed to, how is someone supposed to know that? Venmo publishes their users' financial transactions. If you notice that and think it's weird and write a post about it, should the company -- possibly retroactively -- be able to decide that the data you're criticizing them for making public wasn't intended to be, and therefore your accessing it was a crime? If you notice this by accident when it's obvious the data shouldn't be public -- you saw it when you made a typo in the URL -- should there be a law that can put you in jail if you admit to this in the process of making the public aware of the company's mistake, even if your access resulted in no harm to anyone?The wording is too vague and it criminalizes too much. \"Malicious hacking\" might not always be wire fraud but in other cases it could be misappropriation of trade secrets etc., i.e. whatever the actual act of malice is. The problem with the CFAA is that it's more or less attempting to be the federal computer law against burglary (i.e. unlawful entry with the intent to commit a crime) except that it makes the \"unlawful\" part too hard to pin down and failed to include the part about intent to commit a crime, which allows it to be applied against people it ought not to.reply",
      "'JumpCrisscross is stipulating that you might be right in this analysis but observing that in practice CFAA doesn't play out that way. I'm instead going to go right at your argument and say that a precise definition of unauthorized access isn't necessary in the first place. The statute turns on intent. It's the burden of the prosecution to prove not just that some kind of access was pro-forma unauthorized, but also that the defendant should have known it was.This is no different than zillions of other criminal statutes, the majority of which hinge on intent.reply",
      "The problem with trying to make everything hinge on intent is that it's incredibly hard to prove what someone was thinking, which makes judges unreasonably sympathetic to the prosecution's inability to do it. And that frequently leads to various ways of diluting the intent requirement.A common one is to apply the requirement narrowly. You didn't intend to hurt anyone or steal anything, but you intended to visit that URL, so that's the prosecution's burden satisfied.Which is why you need it to hinge on more than just intent. Otherwise why do we even have different laws? Just pass one that says it's illegal to be bad, right?reply",
      "How is this any different than all the other commonly prosecuted laws that hinge on intent?reply"

Almost nothing actually implements LESC. Apple refuses to implement OOB pairing, so no peripherals can force you to use it, so everything is subject to MITM attacks.

      "Long ago, before access to the Internet was cheap and plentiful, and way before search engines made finding this kind of information easy, this was a priceless find for an aspiring low-level programmer. All the (semi-)common PC hardware and software documented in one place.Endless hours spent exploring VGA hardware registers and trying to apply them for cool visual effects. Learning how the then-new 32-bit Windows interacted with DOS extenders, and trying to make a homemade - very basic - operating system that could do it, too. The thrill of writing a Terminate and Stay Resident alarm clock, and having it finally not explode...I have very fond memories of the Ralf Brown's Interrupt List.reply",

      "> But oh what a difference it makes in the accounting! In the first case, where Autodesk sold the copy of AutoCAD to the dealer, that was the whole transaction; whatever happened to the copy of AutoCAD after the dealer paid for it has no effect on Autodesk\u2019s books. Autodesk sells, dealer pays, end of story. But in the second case, when Autodesk sells to Spacely Sprockets, that appears on Autodesk\u2019s ledger as a sale of AutoCAD for $1000. The instant the $1000 shows up, however, we immediately cut a check for the commission, $500, and mail it to the representative, leaving the same $500 we\u2019d get from the dealer. Same difference, right? Not if you\u2019re an accountant! In the first case, Autodesk made a sale for $500 and ended up, after expenses and taxes, with $125, and therefore is operating with a 25% margin (125/500). In the Spacely sale, however, the books show we sold the product for $1000, yet wound up only with the same $125. So now our margins are a mere 12.5% (125/1000).I'd like to know how an accountant would respond to the above. Based on his two examples, it seems like accounting rules really distort the financial picture of a company.reply",
      "I think the accountant would retort that it's way better to get $125 of profit from $500 of revenue than from $1000 of revenue, overall.  In the former case, you have a lot of padding for conditions to change, and in the latter case you don't.And, if there's some outside dealer that can make a profit taking their $500 cut, but you need to pay all of the $500 out-- it seems like your sales function is less efficient-- less efficient than the rest of Autodesk and less efficient than the outside dealer.Margins aren't everything.  Absent outside judgment, I think I'd rather make, say, $175 profit from $1k of revenue than $125 from $500.  But I wouldn\u2019t trade $125 on $500 for $126 on $1,000.And, of course, there's always the strategic concerns. Control of accounts, opportunities to upsell or cross-sell, etc, etc.  Financial reporting can't tell the whole story, because you can't boil down the whole story of a company to a few numbers.  It's the triumph of GAAP that it's a pretty dang good start to understanding most companies.reply",

      "Depending on what you\u2019re optimizing for could be revenue (high growth) or Net income per share (lower growth).Reality is once you\u2019ve established a baseline it\u2019s difficult to move from one to the other or have substantial changes to the negative for either.reply",
      "Any investor with half a brain is not solely looking at one specific margin to analyze an investment.  That is why you compare profit margin and operating margin and revenue and other measures to build a more accurate picture.reply",
      "We have something similar with tariffs. We pass them through to the client, and they show up as revenue and expenses like this Autodesk example.. But, we immediately deduct the tariff expense from the tariff revenue above the gross revenue line, so Gross Revenue is not affected.reply",
      "Profitability is all lies, you report what you want, the goal is to ensure whatever numbers you want to communicate raises nicely quarter over quarter.reply",
      "There are revenue recognition rules that govern what Revenue is on the P&L. Same with costs/expenses. But I would say if anything, profits are easier to manipulate than revenue.reply",
      "Yeah the advice I\u2019ve heard is that if a company refuses to provided audited GAAP numbers, just run away, no point at all in engaging beyond that.And even if they do provide those numbers, you still need to scrutinize the cash flow statement and balance sheet.reply"

      "This is super cool, but I wonder what the application might be.I can imagine wanting to use it to pepper in 3D elements into an existing RN app, but surely embedding the entire Godot engine is kinda heavy?Then I can imagine wanting to embed a larger 3D experience into an RN app... maybe a 3D product preview or something? I guess that could be cool. But still, the heft of embedding the Godot frameworks...I am actually developing an app that has 3d elements, but if i were to use this the Godot experience might just feel too separate from the rest of the app. like 2 siphoned off apps in one.
