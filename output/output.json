      "I found that looking at the original motivation of logarithms has been more elucidating than the way the topic is presented in grade-school. Thinking through the functional form that can solve the multiplication problem that Napier was facing (how to simplify multiplying large astronomical observations), f(ab) = f(a) + f(b), and why that leads to a unique family of functions, resonates a lot better with me for why logarithms show up everywhere. This is in contrast to teaching them as the inverse of the exponential function, which was not how the concept was discussed until Euler. In fact, I think learning about mathematics in this way is more fun \u2014 what original problem was the author trying to solve, and what tools were available to them at the time?\n \nreply",

Since this terminology is just logarithms without saying the word, if it is more useful it, too, will probably be used by mathematicians, and then it will similarly come to sound like advanced math.

I'm not completely sure that \"magnitude\" avoids both these issues, but it's at least arguable that it suffers less from them.)\n \nreply"

Prolog is really for indeterministically searching a large/infinite space such as in planning (and yes it can be used for theorem proving and program verification as well).

Nothing that we do is so unique that another competent engineer shouldn't be able to fill in for you when you are having an off day.The effect of consistent, careful, workmanlike effort over time trumps any number of crunch weeks and burnout episodes, to an almost absurd degree.\n \nreply",

There was a huge migration of people who couldn't write code from NY to SF in a \"there's gold in them thar hills\" kind of way.Now the people entering the industry by and large see it as a game of wealth acquisition similar to finance or big law, and big tech is adapting in a similar way -- high salaries, insanely bad wlb, politics far exceeding any other skill as a determiner of career progression.\n \nreply",

      "Those electrical systems are about 85% efficient once the chemical energy in the coal has been converted to kinetic energy in the turbine.

Burning coal or natural gas produces lots of heat, and while some of that heat turns the turbine, there's still a lot left that gets lost to the condenser or to the exhaust flue and atmosphere.However, that's where steam distribution is awesome: It enables cogeneration, where some of the waste heat from electricity production can be efficiently used by heating industries. The electrical plant requires supercritical steam at 1000F and 1000 PSI, but the steam network only needs steam at ~150 PSI and 350F, which still has a lot of energy in it from the burners but is of comparatively little use to the turbine.\n \nreply",

However, under heavy loads, they can sometimes reach up to 150\u00b0C (302\u00b0F), but this is usually the upper limit for safe operation.If that's a core temperature then the insulation might not make it significant, but if the outside leaks this much...

And it is used by Manhattanites, in both iconic buildings and regular apartment blocks, to heat their space and water.Steam functions like any other utility: produced centrally, metered, and delivered into homes and businesses through a 105-mile-long grid of pipework. Like electricity, sewage, and water, it plays an integral part in the daily operation of the city.Today, the Manhattan steam system is responsible for h"

      "Nice.It took me a few times to realize that I could do bombs or slingshots by clicking in empty space. The tutorial makes it look like you have to click on a bubble. Maybe the black circle in the tutorial should be removed?I also got a little confused in the beginning about par vs lives. At first it seemed like par was the only important thing, since that's what pops up after the level. The lives icon at the bottom wasn't particularly noticeable to me. I just kind of figured there were only N levels, until I finally realized that dropping bubbles was making me lose lives.Edit: Oh, and you can multi-touch and set off multiple slingshots at once!

      "This is the approach my uTest testing library (https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/utest) takes. I don't think it's unique to functional tests, even unit tests tend towards this pattern. Tests naturally form a tree structure, for multiple reasons:- You usually have shared initialization nearer the root and the various cases you want to assert at the leaves.- You want to group related tests logically together, so it's not one huge flat namespace which gets messy- You want to run groups of tests at the same time, e.g. when testing a related featureTypically, these different ways of grouping tests all end up with the same grouping, so it makes a lot of sense to have your tests form a tree rather than a flat list of @Test methods or whateverNaturally you can always emulate this yourself. e.g. Having helper setup methods that call each other and form a hierarchy, or having a tagging discipline that forms a hierarchy to let you call tests that are related, or simply using files as the leaf-level of the larger filesystem tree to organize your tests. All that works, but it is nice to be able to simplify define a tree of tests in a single file and have all that taken care of for you\n \nreply",
      "If you specify the operations (API) of your system in a relational algebra, then you can use that algebra to generate valid state transitions. (this essentially can construct the tree of continuations the article is discussing or enumerate the paths of this tree)If you create a query language, then the state can be verified to match expectations at any point.I'm not sure why we don't program like this.\n \nreply",
      "End-to-end (e2e) tests are slow and flaky. They don't have to be, but effort to fix breakage starts consuming most available time.One idea is to separate scraping from verification. The latter would run very fast and be reliable: it only tests against stored state.Then scraping is just procedural, clicking things, waiting for page loads, and reading page elements into a database.Some consequences are needing integrity checks to ensure data has been read (first name field selector was updated but not populated), self-healing selectors (AI, et al), and certifying test results against known versions (fixing the scraper amid UI redesign).A lot of effort is saved by using screenshot diffing of, say, React components, especially edge cases. It also (hopefully) shifts-left test responsibility to the devs.Ideally, we only have some e2e tests, mostly happy paths, that also act as integration tests.We could combine these ideas with \"stacked databases\" from the article and save on duplication.Finally, the real trick is knowing, in the face of changes, which tests don't have to run, making the whole run take less time.\n \nreply",

I could imagine building a testing system on top of this which could support the tree pattern described by Evan here (as long as your tests don't themselves need to test transaction-related behavior).Since ChatGPT Code Interpreter works with o3-mini now I had that knock up a very quick proof of concept using Python and SQLite SAVEPOINT, which appears to work: https://chatgpt.com/share/67d36883-4294-8006-b464-4d6f937d99...\n \nreply",

      "You would lose the performance optimisations of a copy, but you can still express tests in this tree fashion with global state. You just need to recurs the tree from the top down and run the entire path up to each node.

      "The code doesn't have to be nested, it can be factored into methods. Additionally, these aren't technically continuations in the sense of the \"continuation passing style\" popular in web programming, so don't confer the same drawbacks. Tests are essentially organised as a pipeline of functions which gets run, it's just that the pipeline has forks in it where the data flows along both forks.\n \nreply",

But for slow tests that isn\u2019t as important as keeping the redundant setup away.I like the tree idea but once we have simple pure/immutable we don\u2019t really have the problem of redundant setup being slow, just ugly.\n \nreply",

A former colleague estimates that the right ratio is around 3 lines of functional test code for every line of \u201creal\u201d code. Writing test code is often mindless and repetitive, because all you do is trace out all the steps a user could take and write down all the things that should be true about each one.A great deal of test code simply exists to set up the tests. Sometimes you can abstract out the logic into setup() and teardown() functions, and put the fake data needed for tests into things called fixtures. Even then, you\u2019ll often have a subset of tests that requires additional setup, and test code often becomes littered with miniature, unofficial setup functions.I"

When you read the messy history of maths, and understand it is an organic, growing field, you feel a little less like an imposter struggling to understand how anyone could've come up with this.Reading these books (primarily as a software engineer), made me feel better about not immediately getting certain concepts, because it's likely the people these theorems are named after didn't get it either, to begin with. They refined it, they collaborated (like a pull request almost) and eventually everything got very neatly packaged up into a set of theorems.

      "It's an interesting idea but I really don't like it.The runs not being visible makes it a really unsatisfying experience - you just kindof click around hoping that a cell is part of a long run (and therefore more constrained).Most runs are length 2-3 as well and entirely within the the same \"region\", so are therefore redundant as they're already constrained by box logic.Nice idea but its a miss for me.\n \nreply",

But it does add the option of printing which is nice.Looking at your example puzzle with all lines visible; the 8742 line in the top right and 896 in the bottom right are both redundant (second one doubly so since it's all givens). Maybe 50% of the two-cell lines are redundant and 33% of the 3-cell; so it might be manageable?\n \nreply",
      "try it now, I think showing the runs is an improvement. I think theres a few more things I can do to improve the visuals. I also updated the article to make the rules for runs more general - a human could place them anywhere they'd like without the even/odd side constraint.\n \nreply",
      "> I think theres a few more things I can do to improve the visuals.You could:\u2022 Make the run lines thicker, and use B\u00e9zier curves to give them a flow, which is easier to process as a whole than a series of thin line segments.\u2022 Apply a faded background color to the end tiles. Have dead-ends stop at the edge of end-tiles, with a large terminal dot on the edge line. Shading, edge-dots, and lack of internal lines will help all the end-tiles stand out from the other tiles, even when glancing at the diagram as a whole.\u2022 When you select a tile, also highlight the run lines that go through it by adding outline along the (now thicker) paths, or a bolder/saturated color. And highlight (to a lesser degree) all the end-tiles of those runs.I think those might make the puzzle more attractive, reactive and add to its distinctive look. And make the different logic of each puzzle easier to visually process.\n \nreply",

      "My girlfriend really enjoys this. I have a design improvement suggestion: the connector lines should just go straight from the center of the opposite edges without also going through the center of the polygon as a midpoint. Going through the midpoint causes them to bend slightly and also become indistinguishable, but if they did not all go through that point, they would be unlikely to all intersect on the same exact point and be easier to tell apart.\n \nreply",
      "I'm currently tweaking the line paths in a way similar to what you're describing!\n \nreply",
      "Solved, and it was fun!  But...some of the colored lines were hard to see.  Particularly the light yellow ones.  I had one \"alternate\" solution that it was marking incorrect for reasons it took me over a minute to spot...and it was just a super light yellow line I missed without really scrunching up to my screen.Improving the color choice might help, but slightly thicker lines I think would also be of significant help.Also, it's common for sudoku solvers to allow you to press Shift+number to do a one-off toggle for the \"note\" checkmark.\n \nreply",
      "This was hard, but fun!One suggestion: make empty spaces visually distinct from filled spaces. Why? Because cell 73 in the tenth puzzle (today's) is small enough that I completely overlooked it, and used faulty logic to deduce all but two spaces before I discovered it.

BUT If you ask for my opinion, merely knowing a list of statistical formulas is not very helpful. Most of the time, people don\u2019t remember the underlying assumptions, so there is a fair chance they will use them in inappropriate situations.I recommend watching these two YouTube videos. The presenters advocate using simulation/bootstrapping/shuffling methods instead of memorizing formulas.Jake Vanderplas - Statistics for Hackers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYAJohn Rauser - Statistics Without the Agonizing Pain\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o\n \nreply",

      "While I really liked the video by vanderplas, I did return to it after a year or two and paused every time he presented a problem and then tried to solve it using for loops and thinking hard.I barely succeeded in any of it.

      "Studying more statistics is often clever. Although in this case Mr. Miller led the the most important part - if there are two numbers (like 7 and 5) in a statistical context they might be the same number. That throws a lot of people into such a tailspin that they never really recover after making the obvious mistake of thinking they are different.The powerful heuristic for the less technically inclined is to say \"well, this evidence isn't conclusive until someone who knows statistics has tried to shoot it down\".\n \nreply",

They're coefficients you can put in front of some matrices or vectors that change their magnitude.Linear Algebra was the most useful and fun math class I took in college. Highly recommended if you ever wanna do gamedev.

      "It upsets me that the only widely available versions of Amadeus now is the \"extended edition,\" which fundamentally alters the film\u2019s core message.In the original theatrical cut, Salieri is a deeply flawed but fascinating character\u2014a man consumed by jealousy, yet also in awe of Mozart\u2019s genius. His sabotage of Mozart is tragic, not just because of what it does to Mozart, but because Salieri himself recognizes the beauty he is trying to destroy. There\u2019s a complexity there: Salieri hates Mozart, but he also admires him. He wishes, more than anything, that he could be his friend, but he cannot overcome his own bitterness.The extended edition, however, adds a crucial change: Salieri doesn\u2019t just work against Mozart\u2014he actively humiliates Mozart\u2019s wife, Constanze. This transforms Salieri from a tormented, conflicted figure into something much simpler: a villain. Instead of a man waging a war against God through Mozart, he\u2019s just a petty, lecherous schemer.The real Antonio Salieri was not some scheming villain\u2014he was a respected composer, teacher, and conductor who mentored some of the greatest musicians of the next generation, including Beethoven, Schubert, and Liszt.\n \nreply",

      "> BeethovenThe mythical rivalry should be with Beethoven, not Mozart!True tidbits:* Beethoven actually referred to Salieri as his \"most active opponent\" (Solomon's translation)* Salieri criticized Beethoven's opera Fidelio (as did a lot of other composers of the time)* Salieri didn't like Beethoven's late works. And apparently he critiqued them so hard that he even caused Schubert, another of his students, to not like Beethoven's music for a short time.Armed just with that I could probably work slowly but surely over time to turn all of HN full Q-anon on a Salieri vs. Beethoven conspiracy. But I'll be good and vaccinate everyone here-- Beethoven also had a difficult relationship with his other famous teacher Joseph Haydn. He was quite a moody guy!
