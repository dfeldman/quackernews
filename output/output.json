It'll always be more newsworthy to bring in a new framework than add incremental fixes to the old one.React has had tremendous success in the web world, so why not try and get those developers more comfortable producing apps for your platform?(Tangentially, see also the mixed reaction to Mac native apps switching from AppKit to SwiftUI)reply",

      "Also, don't forget to set up an RSS or Atom feed for your website. Contrary to the recurring claim that RSS is dead, most of the traffic to my website still comes from RSS feeds, even in 2\u03360\u03362\u03365\u0336 2026!  In fact, one of my silly little games became moderately popular because someone found it in my RSS feed and shared it on HN. [1]From the referer (sic) data in my web server logs (which is not completely reliable but still offers some insight), the three largest sources of traffic to my website are:1. RSS feeds - People using RSS aggregator services as well as local RSS reader tools.2. Newsletters - I was surprised to discover just how many tech newsletters there are on the Web and how active their user bases are. Once in a while, a newsletter picks up one of my silly or quirky posts, which then brings a large number of visits from its followers.3. Search engines - Traffic from Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing and similar search engines. This is usually for specific tools, games and HOWTO posts available on my website that some visitors tend to return to repeatedly.[1] https://susam.net/from-web-feed-to-186850-hits.htmlreply",
      "Now that browser developers did their best to kill RSS/Atom...Does a Web site practically need to do anything to advertise their feed to the diehard RSS/Atom users, other than use the `link` element?Is there a worthwhile convention for advertising RSS/Atom visually in the page, too?(On one site, I tried adding an \"RSS\" icon, linking to the Atom feed XML, alongside all the usual awful social media site icons.  But then I removed it, because I was afraid it would confuse visitors who weren't very Web savvy, and maybe get their browser displaying XML or showing them an error message about the MIME content type.)reply",
      "I use RSS Style[1] to make the RSS and Atom feeds for my blog human readable. It styles the xml feeds and inserts a message at the top about the feed being meant for news readers, not people. Thus technically making it \"safe\" for less tech savvy people.[1]: https://www.rss.style/reply",

You'd publish the truncated version to RSS and force someone to visit the site for the whole version, usually just in exchange for ad views. Honestly while it wasn't the greatest use of RSS it was better than most paid blogs today being ad-wall pop-up pay-gate nightmares of UX.reply",

I have a small collection of blogs that I follow and it's much easier to have them all loaded up in my RSS reader of choice than it is to regularly stop by each blog in my browser, especially for blogs that seldomly post (and are easy to forget about).Readers come with some nice bonus features, too.

      "This is thematically amazing when you consider what the song is about \u2014 the roboticization of the abducted band. (Music video:)https://youtu.be/gAjR4_CbPpQIn this song, which is also chapter four of the movie Interstella 5000 movie (spoilers from here!), the knocked-out singers are scanned, parameterized, brainwashed, uploaded into The Matrix, and then used in the following songs of the movie-album to robotically mass produce music.It makes perfect sense that the BPM is 123.45 because that\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you get when a manager  (who\u2019s shown at the end!) just enters some numbers on the keyboard into the bpm field. They don\u2019t keysmash the numpad; they just hit 123456789 until the field is full!So not only does the song itself convey what some boss thinks is music, robotically beating at 123.45 bpm, but it is itself about being endlessly-rotating brainwashed-boring cogs in a pop music production industrial machine. I\u2019m pretty sure the movie scene cuts and animations are timed specifically to the beats of the song, but knowing that they\u2019re timed to a machine-specific bpm that a human would never select at random with a metronome?Absolute genius.I had no idea. Thanks for posting this.EDIT: At 123.4567bpm, I think the track has precisely 0.2345 seconds of silence before the first 'beat' of the song and actually has 456 beats total, which is either numerological nonsense or pure genius by Daft Punk.

      "This is Unix V4 from 1973. The total number of installations world wide was around 20, all inside Bell Labs. There was no networking support at all, so security was mostly physical, i.e., office building security (though you could dial in with a modem). Multi-user support was a bunch of serial-line terminals. Pretty much everyone knew everyone else who was on the system.reply",
      "Most computers did not exist in an adversarial environment at the time.Perhaps the most \"adversarial\" context would be: undergraduate timeshare use. So the mainframes of the day, which would be the typical platform for undergrad programming (if timeshare was even offered to undergrads in 1973) might be expected to be somewhat hardened to attacks of various kinds since undergrads trying to hack their grade higher, get more CPU time, etc, was a known thing.But Unix machines, and minicomputers in general, were not used for undergrad purposes. They were only available to be used by PhD candidates and other higher order beings. Those dudes had the root password anyway, so no need to harden the machine against their potential attacks. There was no networking to speak of, so no malicious traffic to worry about. The first worm didn't appear until the late 1980s.So if you had talked to a Unix sysadmin in 1973 (all...1 of them) they probably would understand the general concept of someone running a program that crapped onto kernel memory with the result they could have root privileges, but there would have been no plausible adversary around with any reason to mount that attack. Plus every cycle and every byte counted, so there would have been many more fish to fry before worrying about buffer overflow problems.reply",
      "> since undergrads trying to hack their grade higherWould student records even be stored on an unix system at the time? I am under the impression that Unix was very much a research operating system in the 1970's (either the subject of or a tool for). Administrative functions were more likely to be conducted with an IBM mainframe. (At least that is how it was when I arrived at university a couple of decades later, which I always took to be a legacy thing.)reply",

      "I had the Unihertz Titan for a while .  It was a fun experiment, but I ultimately found it too annoying for continued daily useFirst, typing was actually slower and more error prone. Even nearly a year into owning it, I was constantly misclicking and spending loads of time correcting myself.Second, you loose a ton of navigate functionality with the hardware keyboards. Holding space to navigate between characters is gone. Emojis are gone. GIF keyboards are gone.Third, none of the apps are built for this aspect ratio or screen size. Often this is just an annoyance - but there are times this became an actual, legitimate blocker. Items would be laid out off screen in a way that you couldn\u2019t access them. The solution: a scaled view where everything was ridiculously tiny.Three B: too many situations where the virtual keyboard would come up and you\u2019d literally have the entire screen covered.I didn\u2019t realize how much value I lose with these issues until I experienced them. Every thing you\u2019ve relied on essentially become unreliable because you might not be able to use certain functionality.reply",
      "I have the Titan 2 and I find that with the right software, these problems aren't as bad in the new release. The typing itself is a personal preference, of course; the keyboard needs to happen to be the right size for your hands or you're going to have a bad time. For navigating between characters, there's an excellent open source keyboard (https://github.com/palsoftware/pastiera) that provides a lot of features normally present in a soft keyboard that Unihertz didn't include in their keyboard. I switch between that and Swiftkey, though Swiftkey likes to open a full soft keyboard interface for no reason no matter how many ways I try to disable it.The aspect ratio/screen size issue is annoying, but I find that a combination of the screen lock setting (for annoying apps that rotate the screen when they go \"full screen\") combined with scrolling using the capacitive keyboard works just fine without blocking the entire screen.The one problem I have with the phone, and the reason I'm not dailying it, is that Unihertz is notoriously bad at providing software updates. I'm not too impressed with the Clicks phone either on that front, though at least they're beating Unihertz:> Communicator will run Android 16. We\u2019re comfortable committing to 2 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.The clicks launcher looks pretty slick, though. I'll definitely try to run that on my Titan 2 when the APK eventually gets dumped.reply",
      "As for the typing itself, just curious, were you a Blackberry user in the past? I was for 15+ years, but I've never used a Unihertz. But my typing experience was always running circles around every poor soul with a touch keyboard.As to the rest - I owned one of every model of BlackBerry's Android PKB phones and none of this was an issue, so I'd say a lot of it may be Unihertz's execution. Losing navigation functionality with a PKB? That's shocking, you should have _gained_ advantage rather than lost anything.Makes me almost happy I haven't gone for a Unihertz when my last Key2 croaked.reply",
      "Yes, I was. I had a physical-keyboard phone for as long as I reasonably could.What I realized is modern soft-keyboards are actually exceptionally good handling slight miss-clicks. I stopped worrying about hitting the key exactly and just punched it close enough. Auto-correct seems able to figure out that 5% off of a key should be weighed as that key being hit and gets the word right.With a hard keyboard, I'd just end up with total garbage sometimes.reply",
      "Not the person you're replying to, but I was a big BB user in the 2000s and had the Blackberry Passport briefly in 2015 to test its Android app compatibility (it was pretty damn compatible!).What I discovered was that the best BB keyboards for error-free typing were the curved 4-row keyboards on the Bold 9000, 9700 and 9900. The Passport kb was flat, rectangular and only had 3 rows over a very wide layout and placed at the very bottom of the phone, making it cramped to type on. I love the idea of keyboard phones but only BB of yore did it right.reply",
      "miss the bold 9000 so muchit sounds like there is a slow and steady open source community around either replacement q20 keyboards, or a reverse-engineered one? https://hackaday.com/2025/06/04/the-blackberry-keyboard-how-...and the beepy, which runs linux and for some reason has the keyboard blurred out on its homepage https://beepy.sqfmi.com/reply",
      "This one says the keyboard is touch sensitive, like the old android blackberries, so you can still do some swipe gesturesreply",
      "I have the Titan slim, and my experience is similar to what you described. I think most of the bad experience is caused by Unihertz half competent implementation.Phones with hardware keyboard like this requires a good keyboard companion app, which Unihertz doesn't have.reply",
      "Holding the spacebar down... I never knew about this... are there any other Apple keyboard secrets?reply",
      "I had a Motorola Dext, HTC Desire Z, Blackberry Passport, Blackberry KeyOne, and Titan Pocket. And Gemini PDA.The Passport was pretty much perfect, and I've not loved a phone as much before or since.ISTR Unihertz had to make some significant UX tradeoffs to avoid a Blackberry patent infringement (how else do you explain that shift key). I also found it tiresome to use.And the screen was square, which many websites didn't like. And high resolution and small, which made it fiddly to use.I don't know if I'll get the Clicks Communicator. Mostly because looking at the above list, I'd have to admit that I have a phone problem...(I also have another phone problem, which is that I can't seem to type anything accurately on my iPhone keyboard.

      "It looks like there are two maintained implementations of this at the moment - one in C# https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki/.NET-Library  and another in TypeScript/JavaScript https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJsonJs. They each have their own test suite.There's an older pure Python version but it's no longer maintained - the author of that recently replaced it with a Python library wrapping the C# code.This looks to me like the perfect opportunity for a language-independent conformance suite - a set of tests defined as data files that can be shared across multiple implementations.This would not only guarantee that the existing C# and TypeScript implementations behaved exactly the same way, but would also make it much easier to build and then maintain more implementations across other languages.Interestingly the now-deprecated Python library does actually use a data-driven test suite in the kind of shape I'm describing: https://github.com/masaccio/compact-json/tree/main/tests/dat...That new Python library is https://pypi.org/project/fractured-json/ but it's a wrapper around the C# library and says \"You must install a valid .NET runtime\" - that makes it mostly a non-starter as a dependency for other Python projects because it breaks the ability to \"pip install\" them without a significant extra step.reply",

      "In practice mutation fuzz testers are able to whitebox see where branches are in the underlying code, with a differential fuzz test under that approach its generally able to fuzz over test cases that go over all branches.So I think under some computer science theory case for arbitrary functions its not possible, but for the actual shape of behavior in question from this library I think its realistic that a decent corpus of 'real' examples and then differential fuzzing would give you more confidence that anyone has in nearly any program's correctness here on real Earth.reply",
      "Yes, there are different levels of sureness being described.When I hear guarantee, it makes me think of correctness proofs.Confidence is more of a practical notion for how much you trust the system for a given use case. Testing can definitely provide confidence in this scenario.reply",
      "You can guarantee that all the cases in the code are tested. That doesn't necessarily mean that all the behaviour is tested. If two implementations use very different approaches, which happen to have different behaviour on the Mersenne primes (for deep mathematical reasons), but one of them special-cases byte values using a lookup table generated from the other, you wouldn't expect mutation testing to catch the discrepancy. Each implementation is still the local optimum as far as passing tests is concerned, and the mutation test harness wouldn't know that \"disable the small integer cache\" is the kind of mutation that shouldn't affect whether tests pass.There are only 8 32-bit Mersenne primes, 4 of which are byte-valued. Fuzzing might catch the bug, if it happened to hit one of the four other 32-bit Mersenne primes (which, in many fuzzers, is more likely than a uniform distribution would suggest), but I'm sure you can imagine situations where it wouldn't.reply",
      "I think if you hit full path coverage in each of them independently and run all the cases through both and check they're consistent you're still done.Or branch coverage for the lesser version, the idea is still to generate interesting cases based on each implementation, not based solely on one of them.reply"

He recalled that the networking courses he took did not cover IPv6 at all, except to describe the address format (i.e. 128 bits, written as hexadecimal, colon-separated). Everything he learned about IPv6, he had to learn on his own or on the job. A standard that has been published for over two decades, heavily used for over a decade, and critical in the worldwide growth of the Internet, was treated as an afterthought by one of the premier universities in the US.Obvious disclaimer: This is a sample size of 1, and an anecdote is not data, yada yada.

Use IPv6 which works and goes directly to the virtual machine because each virtual machine grabs its own address from one of my 18446744073709551616 addresses.\n  2.

Noting booming interest in the internet, the internet community went looking for ways to avoid an IP address shortage that many feared would harm technology adoption and therefore the global economy.A possible fix arrived in December 1995 in the form of RFC 1883, the first definition of IPv6, the planned successor to IPv4.The most important change from IPv4 to IPv6 was moving from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses, a decision that increased the available pool of IP addresses from around 4.3 billion to over 340 undecillion \u2013 a 39-digit number. IPv6 was therefore thought to have future-proofed the internet, because nobody could imagine humanity would ever need more than a handful of undecillion IP addresses, never mind the entire range available under IPv6.As bil"

      "I've been wondering when we will see general purpose consumer FPGAs, and eventually ASICs, for inference. This reminds me of bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining started with GPUs. I think I remember a brief FPGA period that transitioned to ASIC. My limited understanding of Google's tensor processing unit chips are that they are effectively a transformer ASIC. That's likely a wild over-simplification of Google's TPU, but Gemini is proof that GPUs are not needed for inference.I suspect GPU inference will come to an end soon, as it will likely be wildly inefficient by comparison to purpose built transformer chips. All those Nvidia GPU-based servers may become obsolete should transformer ASICs become mainstream. GPU bitcoin mining is just an absolute waste of money (cost of electricity) now. I believe the same will be true for GPU-based inference soon. The hundreds of billions of dollars being invested on GPU-based inference seems like an extremely risky bet that ASIC transformers won't happen, although Google has already widely deployed their own TPUs.reply",
      "This is a common misunderstanding from industry observers (not industry practitioners). Each generation of (NVIDIA) GPU is an ASIC with different ISA etc. Bitcoin mining simply was not important enough (last year, only $23B Bitcoin mined in total (at $100,000 per)). There is amped incentive to implement every possible instructions useful into GPU (without worrying about backward compatibility, thanks to PTX).ASIC transformers won't happen (defined as a chip with single instruction to do sdpa from anything that is not broadly marketed as GPU, and won't have annualized sale more than $3B). Mark my word. I am happy to take a bet on longbets.org with anyone on this for $1000 and my part will go to PSF.reply",
      "FPGAs will never rival gpus or TPUs for inference. The main reason is that GPUs aren't really gpus anymore. 50% of the die area or more is for fixed function matrix multiplication units and associated dedicated storage. This just isn't general purpose anymore. FPGAs cannot rival this with their configurable DSP slices. They would need dedicated systolic blocks, which they aren't getting. The closest thing is the versal ML tiles, and those are entire peoxessors, not FPGA blocks. Those have failed by being impossible to program.reply",
      "> FPGAs will never rival gpus or TPUs for inference. The main reason is that GPUs aren't really gpus anymore.Yeah.  Even for Bitcoin mining GPUs dominated FPGAs.  I created the Bitcoin mining FPGA project(s), and they were only interesting for two reasons: 1) they were far more power efficient, which in the case of mining changes the equation significantly.  2) GPUs at the time had poor binary math support, which hampered their performance; whereas an FPGA is just one giant binary math machine.reply",
      "I have wondered if it is possible to make a mining algorithm FPGA-hard in the same way that RandomX is CPU-hard and memory-hard. Relative to CPUs, the \"programming time\" cost is high.Nice username btw.reply",
      "I think it'll get to a point with quantisation that GPUs that run them will be more FPGA like than graphics renderers.\nIf you quantize far enough things begin to look more like gates than floating point units.  At that level a FPGA wouldn't run your model, it would be one your model.reply",

[...] 83% of students found the oral exam framework more stressful than a written exam.[...]> Take-home exams are dead. Reverting to pen-and-paper exams in the classroom feels like a regression.Yeah, not sure the conclusion of the article really matches the data.Students were invited to talk to an AI. They did so, and having done so they expressed a clear preference for written exams - which can be taken under exam conditions to prevent cheating, something universities have hundreds of years of experience doing.I know some universities started using the square wheel of online assessment during covid and I can see how this octagonal wheel seems good if you've only ever seen a square wheel. But they'd be even better off with a circular wheel, which really doesn't need re-inventing.reply",

And the write up is nothing but the author stating: \"glowing success!\".And they didn't even bother to test the most important thing. Were the LLM evaluations even accurate! Have graders manually evaluate them and see if the LLMs were even close or were wildly off.This is clearly someone who had a conclusion to promote regardless of what the data was going to show.reply",

It's a self-evident claim that just as well could have been the first sentence of the article (\"take-home exams are dead\"), followed by an opinion (\"reverting ... feels like a regression\") which motivated the experiment.Some universities and professors have tried to move to a take-home exam format, which allows for more comprehensive evaluation with easier logistics than a too-brief in-class exam or an hours-long outside-of-class sitting where unreasonable expectations for mental and sometimes physical stamina are factors. That \"take-home exams are dead\" is self-evident, not a result of the experiment in the article. There used to be only a limited number of ways to cheat at a take-home exam, and most of them involved finding a second person who also lacked a moral conscience. Now, it's trivial to cheat at a take-home exam all by yourself.You also mentioned the hundreds of years of experience universities have at traditional written exams. But the type and manner of knowledge and skills that must be tested for vary dramatically by discipline, and the discipline in question (computer science / software engineering) is still new enough that we can't really say we've matured the art of examining for it.Lastly, I'll just say that student preference is hardly the way to measure the quality of an exam, or much of anything about education.reply",

      "> there are likely too many students to maintain a high standard of education anyway.Right on point. I find particularly striking how little is said about whether the best students achieve the best grades. Authors are even candid that different LLMs asses differently, but seem to conclude that LLMs converging after a few rounds of cross reviews indicate they are plausible so who cares. The apparences are safe.reply",
      "A limitation of written exams is in distance education, which simply was hardly a thing for the hundreds of years exams were used. Just like WFH is a new practice employers have to learn to deal with, study from home (SFH) is a phenomenon that is going to affect education.The objections to SFH exist and are strikingly similar to objections to WFH, but the economics are different.

      "This appears to be an alarmist article about something pretty pedestrian. \n1. The fed has intentionally been pulling liquidity out of the system with quantitative tightening. Over the last few years, the fed has shrunk its balance sheet by several trillion dollars (many times what this article is talking about). The fact that there is liquidity tightness is a sign that the fed has succeeded. And they are already stopping their balance sheet run-off, so there is no reason to expect this to get worse.\n2. Repos are a standard tool of the fed. This is the system working as designed when there are liquidity issues.\n3. It is not even clear to me that there are liquidity issues. This looks more like window dressing. On the 31st, banks and others make themselves look a bit prettier for their regulators and shareholders by holding more cash. This always makes overnight funding a little more expensive overnight on the 31st, so more banks are more likely to use fed lines, either repos or fed funds. That doesn't mean there is a problem or sone kind of shadowy bail out. This happens every year, and to a lesser extent, every quarter end.The way that this is written feels intentionally exaggerated. E.g. comparing how much banks earned in profit to how much they are pulling/could pull from thr fed makes no sense. Banks are highly levered. They earn low returns on assets (1-2%), so balance sheet items always look a lot bigger than profits. Thats just the business model of banks. Just wait to see how many years it will take them to earn enough money to pay back their deposits! Its comparing apples and oranges, and anyone who thinks about banks seriously knows that.reply",
      "Without weighing in on the article or your analysis, I would say that any viewpoint on monetary matters that doesn't gravitate in on May 2026 as a possible huge discontinuity is sort of prima facie counterproductive.There's very little bandwidth and audience on monetary matters to start with.

      "+1 to OP's book, which is the best beginner guide I've found for understanding Beancount / plaintext accounting.I was also confused about double-entry accounting for most of my life until I read the article, \"Accounting for Computer Scientists\"[0] by Martin Kleppman (author of Designing Data-Intensive Applications). It explains double entry accounting in a surprisingly accessible way by putting it in terms of graph theory. I don't even like graph theory that much or consider myself competent in it, but Kleppman's explanation was extremely effective.[0] https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/07/accounting-for-compu...reply",
      "\"Quicken is a single-entry accounting system, which means that amounts can appear out of or disappear into thin air. In a double-entry accounting system you can't put amounts in an account without taking it out of another account.\"This summed it up nicely, from https://github.com/mortisj/quicken2beancountreply",
      "What did you find hard to understand about double entry accounting? Seems pretty straightforward. Every transaction affects at least two accounts, and the total debits must equal the total credits. I can't imagine how introducing graph theory simplifies it, although I trust there are interesting insights none-the-less.reply",
      ">What did you find hard to understand about double entry accounting?I didn't understand the point of the two entries.My prior experience with bookkeeping was that I imported my bank statements into some tool and categorized each transaction. So, if I bought a cookie for $5, I'd mark that transaction as \"food,\" and that felt intuitive to me. I didn't understand why it would become two transactions where one is food and the other is my cash. It just felt like, why split it into two? What does that do for me?The \"ah-ha\" moment from Kleppman's post was seeing how it's not just about creating two entries but about defining flows between accounts. The graphs helped because they show how balances increase or decrease as you traverse the nodes.To be clear, it wasn't like I spent hours banging my head against the wall trying to understand double-entry accounting and failed until Kleppman's post. It was just that I'd encountered the idea a few times, and it never clicked until Klepmman.reply",

      "I really loved the previous design with the physical numpad and it seems they've opened up the platform to support more applications beyond a few blessed ones (like Signal in the past).Really put off by this though:> If you don\u2019t pay for a product, you are the product. With MC03, you pay to retain your data rather than paying with it.So you have to pay >$100/year to maintain access to your device? Why do I need to pay to retain data that is on my own device?reply",
      "I'm not saying that I'm approving this company or their products, but I can definitely get behind the idea of paying for OS updates.Part of the premium we pay for an iPhone or a Mac is to finance the development of iOS/MacOS. We get the updates for \"free\" but we actually already paid them when we paid the device.Meanwhile, here it's clear: you pay the device, and then you pay for the OS.The opposite being the product like with Microsoft/Google.Or relying on the goodwill of other people (FOSS).If I take the example of Kagi, I saw how much impact as a customer I have/had on the product.Meanwhile Microsoft/Google/Apple don't care.And on FOSS I could _just_ do the things myself, but I'm not an OS dev and I already spend some time on other FOSS projects (I'm writing this message on an Linux computer).\nDonations are great but they are not reliable/predictable and they don't give you more power to influence the product.Regarding your question \"Why do I need to pay to retain data that is on my own device?\", according to their FAQ:\n\"Without an active subscription, certain core services and privacy features will be limited. To keep your MC03 fully functional, secure, and up to date, an active subscription is required.\"\nhttps://www.punkt.ch/products/mc03-premium-secure-smartphoneSo the phone won't brick itself and you won't lose access to your data.But the company itself give me a bad feeling, like Proton, trying to surf the hype and doing lots of virtue signaling.reply",
      ">I'm not saying that I'm approving this company or their products, but I can definitely get behind the idea of paying for OS updates.>[...]>The opposite being the product like with Microsoft/Google.But Microsoft does offer that, it's called ESU for windows. The problem I suspect is that the cost of maintaining security patches is fixed, and nobody (relatively speaking) wants to pay for it, so other companies like Apple doesn't even bother.reply",
      "> I really loved the previous design with the physical numpadThat's their MP02, different product line, which is pretty much just talk and text plus Signal (\"Pigeon\" on the MP02):\nhttps://www.punkt.ch/products/mp02-4g-minimalist-phoneI recommend the MP02, with one caveat: don't buy it right now. Because there have historically been problems with Pigeon, you really ought to use Signal for Desktop at the same time as Pigeon, in case Pigeon starts having problems. But as of now you can't you can't connect the two (though Signal for Desktop keeps working fine if you already have them synced).I've found the call quality and reliability on the MP02 to be great after a year of use.[Edited to add: MP02 doesn't require a subscription.]reply",
      "People really pay 300+ \u20ac for a phone; it\u2019s crazy to me.I still have some ancient (pre-smartphone) phones lying around, they work just fine and do the same thing.\nTo be fair they don\u2019t come with Signal but then again that doesn\u2019t seem to work well.\nOnly real argument would be the battery - but the last time I tested one of my old burner phones the battery still lasted for about 5 days (crazy right\u2026)reply",
      "None of my old phones works since the networks turned off 3G.reply",
      "To be fair, your old feature phones don\u2019t do the same thing as a modern smart phone\u2014 you just aren\u2019t interested in doing things they aren\u2019t capable of. I have very different use cases.reply",
      "ive been watching the developments of sidephone closely. ive long sought the perfect dumb-ish phone and they just dont exist, the sidephone isn't perfect either but if it delivers it could be much closer. there's pieces of it im not a fan of: closed source OS (for now) and no word on if there will at least be like SDK's to build out things for it.the biggest leap forward in smart phones to me was personally in-hand GPS navigation. that was a game changer. I really _don't_ need to be even opening internet browsers for anything. T9 phone with a week of battery life, the ability to play some mp3's and GPS navigation and.. sigh I guess some way for me to issue MFA for okta/entraid/whatever since that's so ubiquitous with workplace security now... and I'd be set.it's wild how advanced the likes of hardware companies were over a decade ago at making miniature hardware. the last generation ipod nano (7th I think?) was this tiny touch screen device and when I hold it in my hand today it feels ... actually magic. seriously it feels mind blowing, state of the art with how small and responsive it is. like that kind of miniaturization doesn't seem to exist anymore & it's something only the hardware giants at scale seemed to be able to do since they had supply chain connections and R&D warchests to blow on designing custom components. A lot of these dumb phones rely on generalist components I think and they aren't bankrolled with bajillions of dollars to get new R&D going and tooling online to really put an impressive device together, I just never see it in these \"disconnect but stay just connected enough\" dumb-phones that are trying to offer an exit from the noise of modern smart phones.i'd absolutely cherish something that had the form of the nokia xpress music 5310 https://news.softpedia.com/images/extra/MOBILE/large/Nokia_5... with gps navigation, the ability to play music, and workplace MFA capability.that's it, i've thought about it and i seriously don't need anything else. yeah whatsapp and spotify are super ubiquitous these days but they're literally not required to get in touch with me. and for spotify, i finally did do that whole \"nerd mods an ipod 15 years later thing\" and it taught me something that i needed to know about myself: ADHD + spotify = bad. my last decades playlists are a mess, i listen to music _less_ because it's just an onslaught of new stuff and access to everything. something about having a collection of music i actually took time to curate into playlists..i know what's in there i know what i can listen to. it's somewhere between meditative (which is good for me) and very intentional. acquiring new music is now also very intentional, getting it onto my device is intentional. its slower, less convenient, and somehow it makes me enjoy the music experience a lot more. im listening to more music now in a way that I haven't since I was sitting on a schoolbus next to my crush and sharing a headphone with her.all in all I've seen a few of these \"dumb phones, no distraction\" device manufs now like punkt here start off with a cool design and eventually just cave and fold to some full screen touch design. to me that just nixes a lot of checkboxes for me: more screen = undoubtedly more distractions and ways to be connected, i miss buttons, i just... don't want a big phone. ever. i want to be intentional about my connectivity, and that means if i need the internet i need to just go hop on my computer. if im itching to know something and im standing in an elevator or standing on a subway, i actually don't want to be able to pull my phone out and have the immediacy of an answer. i want to stay bored in my head, work on the skill of \"this is important i hope i come back to it lets index that thought and come back to it later\", and just learn to live with being in my own head without the constant need to have an answer or scratch a dopamine itch immediately. there's something ive completely lost over the years, basically that ability to imagine spiderman swinging from the powerlines when i was a kid looking out the window of my parents car. whatever _that_ is, i think that came with a lot of core benefits for my brain activity that generally allowed me to have a more meaningful and happier life.reply",
      "Yes to cancelling Spotify and intentionally creating playlists from your carefully curated music. Or just listening to good old albums.Being able to be alone with our thoughts and let our mind wander and not having to pull out our phone is a good skill to practise.But a phone with a map and gps is quite useful.reply",
      "What I don't get about this devices is the insane price tag. Seems absurd to pay just as much for these things as an Iphone.reply"
