      "The lede is being missed imo.gpt-oss:20b is a top ten model (on MMLU (right behind Gemini-2.5-Pro) and I just ran it locally on my Macbook Air M3 from last year.I've been experimenting with a lot of local models, both on my laptop and on my phone (Pixel 9 Pro), and I figured we'd be here in a year or two.But no, we're here today. A basically frontier model, running for the cost of electricity (free with a rounding error) on my laptop. No $200/month subscription, no lakes being drained, etc.I'm blown away.reply",
      "I tried 20b locally and it couldn't reason a way out of a basic river crossing puzzle with labels changed. That is not anywhere near SOTA. In fact it's worse than many local models that can do it, including e.g. QwQ-32b.reply",

      "I\u2019m still trying to understand what is the biggest group of people that uses local AI (or will)? Students who don\u2019t want to pay but somehow have the hardware? Devs who are price conscious and want free agentic coding?Local, in my experience, can\u2019t even pull data from an image without hallucinating (Qwen 2.5 VI in that example). Hopefully local/small models keep getting better and devices get better at running bigger onesIt feels like we do it because we can more than because it makes sense- which I am all for! I just wonder if i\u2019m missing some kind of major use case all around me that justifies chaining together a bunch of mac studios or buying a really great graphics card. Tools like exo are cool and the idea of distributed compute is neat but what edge cases truly need it so badly that it\u2019s worth all the effort?reply",
      "Privacy, both personal and for corporate data protection is a major reason. Unlimited usage, allowing offline use, supporting open source, not worrying about a good model being taken down/discontinued or changed, and the freedom to use uncensored models or model fine tunes are other benefits (though this OpenAI model is super-censored - \u201csafe\u201d).I don\u2019t have much experience with local vision models, but for text questions the latest local models are quite good. I\u2019ve been using Qwen 3 Coder 30B-A3B a lot to analyze code locally and it has been great. While not as good as the latest big cloud models, it\u2019s roughly on par with SOTA cloud models from late last year in my usage. I also run Qwen 3 235B-A22B 2507 Instruct on my home server, and it\u2019s great, roughly on par with Claude 4 Sonnet in my usage (but slow of course running on my DDR4-equipped server with no GPU).reply",
      "+1 - I work in finance, and there's no way we're sending our data and code outside the organization. We have our own H100s.reply",
      "Add big law to the list as well. There are at least a few firms here that I am just personally aware of running their models locally. In reality, I bet there are way more.reply",
      "I do think Devs are one of the genuine users of local into the future. No price hikes or random caps dropped in the middle of the night and in many instances I think local agentic coding is going to be faster than the cloud. It\u2019s a great use casereply",
      "Yes, and help with grant reviews. Not permitted to use web AI.reply",
      "It's striking how much of the AI conversation focuses on new use cases, while overlooking one of the most serious non-financial costs: privacy.I try to be mindful of what I share with ChatGPT, but even then, asking it to describe my family produced a response that was unsettling in its accuracy and depth.Worse, after attempting to delete all chats and disable memory, I noticed that some information still seemed to persist. That left me deeply concerned\u2014not just about this moment, but about where things are headed.The real question isn't just \"what can AI do?\"\u2014it's \"who is keeping the record of what it does?\" And just as importantly: \"who watches the watcher?\" If the answer is \"no one,\" then maybe we shouldn't have a watcher at all.reply"

      "Nice release. Part of the problem right now with OSS models (at least for enterprise users) is the diversity of offerings in terms of:- Speed- Cost- Reliability- Feature Parity (eg: context caching)- Performance (What quant level is being used...really?)- Host region/data privacy guarantees- LTSAnd that's not even including the decision of what model you want to use!Realistically if you want to use an OSS model instead of the big 3, you're faced with evalutating models/providers across all these axes, which can require a fair amount of expertise to discern. You may even have to write your own custom evaluations. Meanwhile Anthropic/OAI/Google \"just work\" and you get what it says on the tin, to the best of their ability. Even if they're more expensive (and they're not that much more expensive), you are basically paying for the priviledge of \"we'll handle everything for you\".I think until providers start standardizing OSS offerings, we're going to continue to exist in this in-between world where OSS models theoretically are at performance parity with closed source, but in practice aren't really even in the running for serious large scale deployments.reply",

Adding JPEG-XL support is a relatively bigger ticket that has struggled to cross the finish line.The thing I'm really surprised about is that you still can't use arithmetic coding with JPEG.

      "I found myself agreeing with quite a lot of this article.I'm a pretty huge proponent for AI-assisted development, but I've never found those 10x claims convincing. I've estimated that LLMs make me 2-5x more productive on the parts of my job which involve typing code into a computer, which is itself a small portion of that I do as a software engineer.That's not too far from this article's assumptions. From the article:> I wouldn't be surprised to learn AI helps many engineers do certain tasks 20-50% faster, but the nature of software bottlenecks mean this doesn't translate to a 20% productivity increase and certainly not a 10x increase.I think that's an under-estimation - I suspect engineers that really know how to use this stuff effectively will get more than a 0.2x increase - but I do think all of the other stuff involved in building software makes the 10x thing unrealistic in most cases.reply",

I've always been confident of my abilities as an engineer, but I couldn't help but feel like my skills were falling hopelessly behind as I scrolled places like LinkedIn and Twitter. If these sources were to be believed, engineering had moved on from the medieval practice of typing code into an editor. Real engineers were now 10-100x more productive than I was. I'm writing this hoping to help others who are feeling similar anxieties.I'm a skeptical person so I don't usually fall over myself immediately when I hear a claim like that. I usually roll my eyes in the same way I do when someone tells me a simple herbal remedy cures all disease.

      "there are many separate problems of scientific fraud. I think these issues sometimes get confused which is unhelpful.1. apparently-legitimate papers in prestigious journals with fraudulent data. extremely bad.2. legitimate papers in legitimate journals which, innocently or not, just used bad methods and have wrong conclusions. this is \"the replication crisis\".3. totally fake papers in paper mills with no meaningful peer review. it's really easy to spot these, no one is individually getting taken in by the results, but...3a. sometimes they wind up in a meta-analysis, which is really bad because people might trust the meta analysis.Problem 1 is morally worst and much more common than one would hope. Outright fabricated data in a Nature or NEJM publication (as has happened) is a disaster.Problem 2 is amenable to reform for the most part (fields are already doing this).Problem 3 isn't a problem at all for scientific knowledge per se, although universities and funding bodies might not be pleased their scientists are buying fake papers. You can just ignore the paper mills.But Problem 3a can actually alter policy, which is pretty serious.reply",
      "> Problem 1 is morally worst and much more common than one would hope. Outright fabricated data in a Nature or NEJM publication (as has happened) is a disaster.In my experience, fabricated data is rare. But cherry-picking data and misuse of statistics to prove the desired hypotheses is extremely common in top journals from e.g. the Nature family. I'd say at least 1/5 of the articles in biology and medicine have serious methodological errors.IMHO, the main reason are perverse incentives and power imbalance. If you are a student or a postdoc and you get pressure from your supervisor to obtain certain result and you refuse to engage in academic misconduct, you will get pushed out of most projects and this might be the end of your academic career.In contrast, there are few, if any, consequences for the senior scientists and principal investigators who perpetuate this culture. There's no oversight, no integrity checks, nothing. Universities tend to ignore even clear cases of data fabrication and fraud, where e.g. images derived from experiments are fake. Ultimately, this creates selective pressure for misconduct, as those willing to bend the rules are rewarded.reply",

      "I\u2019m sure the author of this is actually a nice person, but this is the first time I\u2019ve actually seen a lisper being smug and obnoxious in the way I\u2019ve seen people satirize a thousand times.reply",
      "Compared to much of what went on comp.lang.lisp this is pretty gentle. Based on the impression it gives of the book, possibly more gentle than it deserves!reply",
      "I think the issue is that the topic comes up quite often as seen by the author needing to create the gist. It easy to come across as a bit of \"smug and obnoxious\" when you explain something for the xth time.I remember chatting with them years ago and they were pretty friendly. But yeah Lisp does have a specific culture and it can put people off thought I personally never encountered any bad apples.reply",
      "I checked some of her other stuff and she seems great! I just wouldn\u2019t want to argue with her about Lisp I think.reply",
      "If the argument was not born from ignorance I think it'd be fine ;) There's a rich history, decades old, of people claiming Lisp can't do X or is bad for Y, or is only a category and the true meaning of Lisp as a category is just having s-expression syntax. Some Lispers get more touchy when such things come up yet again. Attempts to correct misconceptions do work a little bit but just like bad and false popsci memes (remember when the \"you only use 10% of your brain\" myth was more popular?) the false memes seem to spread more easily. It takes a long time to overcome them, if ever.reply",
      "With the exception of one or two sentences, it sounded pretty neutral to me... maybe I just didn't read it closely enough? The \"dogmatism\" of the technical criticism (assuming the post is accurate) really does seem justified to me\u2014e.g. if the book uses dynamic scoping without even a disclaimer like \"this is a bad idea, but we're doing it for simplicity\", that alone makes it a bad recommendation for beginners IMO.reply",
      "I don't know, it doesn't seem overly smug to me. It seems borne of experience and helpfulness.\"And a parser generator is very overkill for a Lisp parser - just use recursive decent!\" -- it's interesting that, as simple as Lisp is to parse, this is the same advice you'd get from experienced C/C++ compiler writers, from modern Clang to Stroustrup in 1993.reply"

Sure you can buy cheap textiles from Thailand or Vietnam or something.Unfortunately this approach does not work when you lack a viable domestic alternative and you're up against a monopoly.What will the US do if TSMC does not blink? Not buy TSMC made chips? Obviously that is impossible, so the logical conclusion is that American consumers will end up paying the tariffs.reply",

China seems to be pretty hostile as well. In the US, it is still much easier to find real information that counters the propaganda than it is in any of those other countries. There's no Great Firewall to bypass. You don't even need to do anything anonymously.

If you honestly think there was more information freely available then as compared to know, you've just disillusioned yourself for whatever reason. Yes, there was resistance back during the Cold War.
