I don't \"see\" blue, the dots are tagged with dot.color == blue.When you ask about the arrangement of the dots, I'll THEN think about it, and then says \"arranged in a triangle.\" But that's because you've probed with your question. Before you probed, there's no concept in my mind of any geometric arrangement.If I hadn't been prompted to think / naturally thought about the color of the apple, and you asked me \"what color is the apple.\" Only then would I say \"green\" or \"red.\"If you asked me to describe my office (for example) my brain can't really imagine it \"holistically.\" I can think of the desk and then enumerate it's properties: white legs, wooden top, rug on ground.

      "The difference is implementation comes down to business goals more than anything.There is a clear directionality for ChatGPT. At some point they will monetize by ads and affiliate links. Their memory implementation is aimed at creating a user profile.Claude's memory implementation feels more oriented towards the long term goal of accessing abstractions and past interactions. It's very close to how humans access memories, albeit with a search feature. (they have not implemented it yet afaik), there is a clear path where they leverage their current implementation w RL posttraining such that claude \"remembers\" the mistakes you pointed out last time. It can in future iterations derive abstractions from a given conversation (eg: \"user asked me to make xyz changes on this task last time, maybe the agent can proactively do it or this was the process last time the agent did it\").At the most basic level, ChatGPT wants to remember you as a person, while Claude cares about how your previous interactions were.reply",

      "Anthropic seems to want to make you buy a subscription, not show you ads.ChatGPT seems to be more popular to those who don't want to pay, and they are therefore more likely to rely on ads.reply",
      "My conjecture is that their memory implementation is not aimed at building a user profile. I don't know if they would or would not serve ads in the future, but it's hard to see how the current implementation helps them in that regard.reply",
      "> I don't know if they would or would not serve ads in the futureThere are 2 possible futures:1) You are served ads based on your interactions2) You pay a subscription fee equal to the amount they would have otherwise earned on adsI highly doubt #2 will happen. (See: Facebook, Google, twitter, et al)Let\u2019s not fool ourselves. We will be monetized.And model quality will be degraded to maximize profits when competition in the LLM space dies down.It\u2019s not a pretty future. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if right now is the peak of model quality, etc. Peak competition, everyone is trying to be the best. That won\u2019t continue forever. Eventually everyone will pivot their priority towards monetization rather than model quality/training.Hopefully I\u2019m wrong.reply",
      "But aren't we only worth something like $300/year each to Meta in terms of ads? I remember someone arguing something like that when the TikTok ban was being passed into law... essentially the argument was that TikTok was \"dumping\" engagement at far below market value (at something like $60/year) to damage American companies. That was something the argument I remember anyway.reply",
      "Here is some old analysis I remember seeing at the time of Hulu ads vs no-ads plans: https://ampereanalysis.com/insight/hulus-price-drop-is-a-wis...They dropped the price $2/mo on their with-ads plan to make a bigger gap between the no-ads plan and the ads plan, and the analyst here looks at their reported ad revenue and user numbers to estimate $12/mo per user from ads.Whether Meta across all their properties does more than $144/yr in ads is an open question; long-form video ads are sold at a premium but Facebook/IG users see a LOT of ads across a lot of Meta platforms. The biggest advantage in ad-$-per-user Hulu has is that it's US-only. ChatGPT would also likely be considered premium ad inventory, though they'd have a delicate dance there around keeping that inventory high-value, and selling enough ads to make it worthwhile, without pissing users off too much.Here they estimate a much lower number for ad revenue per Meta user, like $45 bucks a year - https://www.statista.com/statistics/234056/facebooks-average... - but that's probably driven disproportionately by wealth users in the US and similar countries compared to the long tail of global users.One problem for LLM companies compared to media companies is that the marginal cost of offering the product to additional users is quite a bit higher. So business models, ads-or-subscription, will be interesting to watch from a global POV there.One wonders what the monetization plan for the \"writing code with an LLM using OSS libraries and not interested in paying for enterprise licenses and such\" crowd will be. What sort of ads can you pull off in those conversations?reply",
      "If that\u2019s the case, we have an even bigger problem on our hands. How will these companies ever be profitable?If we\u2019re already paying $20/mo and they\u2019re operating at a loss, what\u2019s the next move (assuming we\u2019re only worth an extra $300/yr with ads?)The math doesn\u2019t add up, unless we stop training new models and degrade the ones currently in production, or have some compute breakthrough that makes hardware + operating costs an order of magnitudes cheaper.reply",
      "OpenAI has already started degrading their $20/month tier by automatically routing most of the requests to the lightest free-tier models.We're very clearly heading toward a future where there will be a heavily ad-supported free tier, a cheaper (~$20/month) consumer tier with no ads or very few ads, and a business tier ($200-$1000/month) that can actually access state of the art models.Like Spotify, the free tier will operate at a loss and act as a marketing funnel to the consumer tier, the consumer tier will operate at a narrow profit, and the business tier for the best models will have wide profit margins.reply",
      "Though in general I like the idea of personal ads for products (NOT political ads), I've never seen an implementation that I felt comfortable with. I wonder if Arthropic might be able to nail that. I'd love to see products that I'm specifically interested in, so long as the advertisement itself is not altered to fit my preferences.reply"

They appear simple, but then after you\u2019ve ensured your file is on non-ephemeral storage, sorted out backups, and thought about vertical scaling or having separate dbs for jobs and models, a lot of the benefits over psql disappear IMO.The main benefit over psql of course being that you don\u2019t need to pay for a hosted db like RDS, or have a separate database server.I\u2019ve found a happy middle ground in simply self-hosting psql and my apps on the same VPS with something like dokploy. Local development is still easy enough, and remote deployment in containers is 1-click with Dokploy, and ends up being simpler to reason about IMO.

Any type of pancreatic function restoration is also potentially good for Type 1.5 (which constitute a sizable chunk of misdiagnosed T2Ds) where the body attacks more slowly (over the course of years) instead of acutely like traditional T1D and so doctors assume it's insulin resistance instead of pancreatic function decline since they both present with the same symptom - hyperglycemia.reply",

These viral vectors work by splicing themselves into random places in the host cell's DNA. Which is fine, except that there's a non-zero chance that in the process, the virus will initiate a cancer.When you combine that with a cell deliberately engineered to hide from the immune system, you have the ticket to a very bad time.reply",

A new study points in that direction.For the first time, researchers succeeded in implanting Crispr-edited pancreatic cells in a man with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

If you go to \u201cAdvanced\u201d the default is to create a user called \u201cadmin\u201d (good!) and has the option for a public SSH key.Our new server, that barely any bot knows exists, already gets 350 failed password login attempts an hour. Worse, these bots can see that password login is enabled on our server, meaning they know they should keep trying. 350 password requests an hour on a strong password isn\u2019t much, but eventually more bots will realize our IP is using passwords and try more. Eventually after copy pasting around a password enough some compromised browser plugin / discord plugin etc will capture the password and put it in a list.Contabo \u201cknows\u201d this, even if they don\u2019t practice it:https://contabo.com/blog/how-to-use-ssh-keys"

      "Thinking about it from the bee's perspective, this is like raiding the lair of an eldritch horror for gold. A beekeeper is just a funny looking bear-thing that takes honey sometimes, but the shop of a beekeeper is full of devices beyond a bee's comprehension, more honey than a bee would ever see in its lifetime just all sitting around, its own sun which can turn on and off. To find yourself in such a place by accident must be a crazy experience, convincing your brethren to attack it by shaking your butt is on another level.reply",

Maybe the story describes the thing in this horrific manner, and the reader slowly realizes what the \"normal\" thing actually is, all the while using factual basis for the phenomena.

      "What communication occurs to draw bees to the location of a fallen hive member?  They seem to do that without the dance at all.  So there's clearly multiple communications layers.

      "I've only dabbled, so I'm happy to have people with more linux-side knowledge to call me out on any inaccuracies here, but...io_uring is effectively as \"secure\" as any other syscall unto itself. The issue is that the mechanism by which io_uring makes its syscalls as part of its submission/completion queues means that those underlying syscalls can't be filtered by seccomp. The real question is your security posture.If you're writing a hypervisor that's intended to partition resources between underlying users in a secure fashion, the ability for io_uring to bypass seccomp is largely a non-starter. But if you own the machine and you just want to run an application on it (i.e. an HTTP server that uses io_uring for file/network io) you should largely be in the clear.reply",
      "Security with io_uring is great these days. Many years ago it moved away from the original architecture that led to several security issues; its current architecture is no more prone to security issues than any other part of the kernel.For context, the original architecture involved having privileged kernel-side offload processing that had to carefully drop privileges each time it did something on behalf of the userspace process. As you can imagine, that fail-insecure architecture was heavily prone to security holes.io_uring got rid of that architecture years ago, in favor of running with the permissions of the userspace process. With that change, there's no longer any reason to consider io_uring any less secure than the rest of the kernel.reply"

      "I think Palantir is highly misunderstood.As a technology, it is just database joins. It is just that they are able to pull in data from everything from S3 to SAP to ArcGIS, and provide analytics, visualization etc. on top to provide global visibility into any system.The visibility can be \"show me all illegal immigrant clusters\" or \"show me bottlenecks and cost sinks in CAHSR construction\".When we offload the moral impetus for society from politics to technology, we also squander control. Tech is tech and can be used for both good and bad. It is not that a strategy that aims to cap downsides by preventing the proliferation of technology is inherently bad, but it is doomed to fail. The evidence for dysfunction is not the existence of Palantir but in the failure of the watchdog layer of society (also called the government).reply",
      "That also deflects moral responsibility away from Palantir: they have and had every choice to question the purpose of their contracts. The essence of Palantir is specifically pursuing government surveillance contracts as a lucrative, never ending source of profit.No doubt Deloitte or any other contractor shop would be able to do the same thing - but they don\u2019t choose to.reply",

Plenty of tech is double-edged. And Palantir very much so.Let me restate my point. Palantir (or that class of tech products) is powerful at enabling visibility over a complex system. But visibility is not decisions, it is an input to decisions. If you had real-time telemetry from every single stomach, you could maybe automatically dispatch drones with food wherever someone is starving. Or you could use the data as a high-frequency indicator for a successful invasion. Morality is downstream of decisions not data.reply",
