      "It's especially bizarre that ROMhacks would be suppressed from IA, when IA has played host to plain-old 100%-infringing ROMs for years now, with nobody seeming to care.(I will not directly link to these collections, for the fates are cruel.

That would be a massive compute expense.reply",
      "> I thought ROM hacks were just modified ROMs, not programs that modify ROMs.Distributing a modified ROM is as much copyright infringement as distributing the base ROM itself, so generally hacks are distributed as just the patch file and you have to provide your own copy of the base ROM and patch it from there.It sounds like this site is packing the two together, and the patchers are causing the flagging issues.  That also to me seems like the simple solution is to not do that and just distribute the patches without the software and have a note in the description pointing to a separate source for the patcher.> Surely an automatic patcher is a pretty trivial piece of software, system-wise. It just reads a binary file and writes out a different binary file after doing some in-memory manipulations. Why would a an AV flag such a program?

Its often the case that the news will say things about the paper that aren't in the paper, often they say something that is completely the opposite of what the paper actually represents with its data. Its become such a common thing and its very common when you can't find the referenced study itself from the article. Sometimes its the authors fault and they said things that aren't supported by the data but the science reporters do this a lot.My basic rule on all science is go at least look at the papers abstract, method and their graphs/data. In 5 minutes you'll be better informed than the pop science article and it gets easier the more you read them.Interruption do impact getting back in but I find it very variable, I actually if I am doing very strict TDD I recover from interruptions well. If I am busy thinking about a design or doing some more complex algorithm performance analysis its all happening in my head and they take longer.

For convolution neural networks it turns out that you can isolate and study the behavior of individual circuits and try to understand what \"traditional image processing\" function they perform, and that gives some decent intuition: https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/ - CNNs become less mysterious when you break them down as being decomposed into \"edge detectors, curve detectors, shape classifiers, etc.\"For LLMs it's a bit harder, but anthropic did some research in this vein.reply",

Seeing this post on the front page has me wondering whether it's actually Backblaze's fault or it's Acronis, now...I've previously tracked down random system freezes caused by some part of the NVIDIA driver interacting with one of my monitors, where the first unlucky process on my system to call certain graphics APIs after a boot or wake-from-sleep would cause the video driver to hold a lock and enumerate display modes for 10+ seconds. The end result was a \"frozen\" PC still responding to input, just unable to send new pixels to any of its displays. The fun part of that one was that profiling would blame these freezes on whatever user mode process was unlucky enough to make that graphics API call - Steam's browser overlay, Visual Studio's WPF rendering, the list goes on.

And given that we've created an entire isolated container with an explicitly installed Python, why is running a Python script via `uv` better than running it via `python`? Why are we also setting up a virtual environment if we have this container already?Since we're already making a `pyproject.toml` so that uv knows what the dependencies are, we could just as well make a wheel, use e.g. pipx to install it locally (no container required) and run the program's own entry point.

B200 costs around $30-40k per GPU, so they are pretty close in performance per dollar.Starting with 4090, NVIDIA limits the performance of tensor cores on gaming cards, specifically for ops that might be used in ML training. FP8 and FP16 matmuls run at full speed if accumulating in FP16 (I've never seen anyone use this), but only half speed when accumulating in FP32. This restriction is not present for lower precision matmuls like FP4, and is removed entirely on the workstation-class cards like RTX Pro 6000.It doesn't seem worth it to use NVIDIA gaming cards as a \"cheaper FLOPs\" alternative anymore (e.g. diffusion models could have been cheaper to run on 3090 than A100). They are generous with memory bandwidth though, nearly 2TB/s on 5090 is amazing!reply",
      "Is there really that big a different in TFLOPS between the GB100 and GB202 chips?\nThe GB100 has fewer SMs than the GB202, so I'm confused about where the 10x performance would be coming from?reply",
      "You're asking a really good question but it's not a question with an easy answer.There's a lot more to performance computing than FLOPs. FLOPs are you good high level easy to understand metric but it's a small part of the story when you're in the weeds.To help make sense of this, look at CPU frequencies. I think most people on HN know that two CPU with the same frequency can have dramatically different outcomes on benchmarks, right? You might know how some of these come down to things like IPC (instructions per cycle) or the cache structures. There's even more but we know it's not so easy to measure, right?On a GPU all that is true but there's only more complexity. Your GPU is more similar to a whole motherboard where your PCIe connection is a really really fast network connection. There's lots of faults to this analogy but this closer than just comparing TFLOPs.Nvidia's moat has always been \"CUDA\". Quotes because even that is a messier term than most think (Cutlass, CuBLAS, cuDNN, CuTe, etc). The new cards are just capable of things the older ones aren't. Mix between hardware and software.I know this isn't a great answer but there is none. You'll probably get some responses and many of them will have parts of the story but it's hard to paint a real good picture in a comment. There's no answer that is both good and short.reply",

But the worst case scenario is imo when people designing data structures and protocols start to feel the need to disallow arbitrary classes of characters, even properly escaped.In the example, username validation is a job of another layer. For example I want to make sure username is shorter than 60 characters, has no emojis or zalgo text, and yes, no null bytes, and return a proper error from the API. I don't want my JSON parsing to fail on completely different layer pre-validation.And for username some classes are obviously bad - like explained. But what if I send text files that actually use those weird tabs. I expect things that work in my language utf8 \"string\" type to be encodable. Even more importantly, I see plenty of use cases for null byte, and it is in fact often seen in JSON in the wild.On the other hand, if we have to use a restricted set of \"normal\" Unicode characters, having a standard feels useful - better than everyone creating their own mini standard. So I think I like the idea, just don't buy the argumentation or examples in the blog post.reply",
      "Yeah, I feel like the only really defensible choices you can make for string representation in a low-level wire protocol in 2025 are:- \"Unicode Scalars\", aka \"well-formed UTF-16\", aka \"the Python string type\"- \"Potentially ill-formed UTF-16\", aka \"WTF-8\", aka \"the JavaScript string type\"- \"Potentially ill-formed UTF-8\", aka \"an array of bytes\", aka \"the Go string type\"- Any of the above, plus \"no U+0000\", if you have to interface with a language/library that was designed before people knew what buffer overflow exploits werereply",
      "> - \"Potentially ill-formed UTF-16\", aka \"WTF-8\", aka \"the JavaScript string type\"I thought WTF-8 was just, \"UTf-8, but without the restriction to not encode unpaired surrogates\"? Windows and Java and JavaScript all use \"possibly ill-formed UTF-16\" as their string type, not WTF-8.reply",
      "Also known as UCS-2: https://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#utf16-11Surrogate pairs were only added with Unicode 2.0 in 1996, at which point Windows NT and Java already existed. The fact that those continue to allow unpaired surrogate characters is in parts due to backwards compatibility.reply",
      "Yeah, people forget that Windows and Java appear to be less compliant, but the reality is that they moved on i18n before anybody else did so their standard is older.Linux got to adopt UTF-8 because the just stuck their head in the sand and stayed on ASCII well past the time they needed to change. Even now, a lot of programs only support ASCII character streams.reply",
      "WTF-8 is more or less the obvious thing to use when NT/Java/JavaScript-style WTF-16 needs to fit into a UTF-8-shaped hole. And yes, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s UTF-8 except you can encode surrogates except those surrogates can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t form a valid pair (use the normal UTF-8 encoding of the codepoint designated by that pair in that case).(Some people instead encode each WTF-16 surrogate independently regardless of whether it participates in a valid pair or not, yielding an UTF-8-like but UTF-8-incompatible-beyond-U+FFFF thing usually called CESU-8. We don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t talk about those people.)reply",
      "The parent\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s point was that \u201a\u00c4\u00fapotentially ill-formed UTF-16\" and \"WTF-8\" are inherently different encodings (16-bit word sequence vs. byte sequence), and thus not \u201a\u00c4\u00faaka\u201a\u00c4\u00f9.reply",
      "Although they're different encodings, the thing that they are encoding is exactly the same. I kinda wish I could edit \"string representation\" to \"modeling valid strings\" or something in my original comment for clarity...reply",
      "By that logic, you could say \u201a\u00c4\u00f2\u201a\u00c4\u00faUTF-8\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 aka \u201a\u00c4\u00faUTF-32\u201a\u00c4\u00f9\u201a\u00c4\u00f4, since they are encoding the same value space. But that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s just wrong.reply",
      "The type is the same, i.e., if you look at a type as an infinite set of values, they are the same infinite set. Yes, their in-memory representations might differ, but it means all values in one exist in the other, and only those, so conversion between them are infallible.So in your last example, UTF-8 & UTF-32 are the same type, containing the same infinite set of values, and \u00ac\u2260\u201a\u00c4\u00ee of course \u201a\u00c4\u00ee one can convert between them infallibly.But you can't encode arbitrary Go strings in WTF-8 (some are not representable), you can't encode arbitrary Python strings in UTF-8 or WTF-8 (n.b. that upthread is wrong about Python being equivalent to Unicode scalars/well-formed UTF-*.) and attempts to do so might error. (E.g., `.encode('utf-8')` in Python on a `str` can raise.)reply"

Metroidvanias are named after Metroid and Castlevania because those series practically defined the genre.Also a bit frustrating because the first Castlevania itself isn't actually a metroidvania, it's a more conventional action-platformer. Castlevania II has non-linear exploration, lots of items to collect, and puzzle-solving, all like Metroid.

      "If you want to get location accuracy lower than 500m without significantly impacting battery life, you can use region monitoring. There's two paths:1. Set up a region around the user's current location. If they exit it, note the location and set up another one around that location. This will give you around 100m accuracy, which is the minimum diameter of the monitored region.2. Set up regions in various cardinal directions that nearly-or-just-barely overlap. If they enter one of those regions, note the location and set up another set around the current location. This can give you something closer to 50m accuracy.For (2), this is how I did it in the Home Assistant iOS app, largely for zones that people wish to monitor which are smaller than 100m.
