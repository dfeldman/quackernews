The current version is 0.0.0a6 and the releases so far are all in service of validating our release process. We're excited to get this in people's hands, but want to set the expectation that we still have a lot of work left to do before this is production ready.Stay tuned for more for news in the near future!(... I work at Astral)\n \nreply",

      "Had you checked it with Pyright previously?\n \nreply",
      "I've only used Pylance standard type checking in vscode. I have not used pyright as a stand alone package.\n \nreply",
      "If you can say - are there any thoughts about implementing plugins / extension capabilities to keep type checking working even with libraries that aren't otherwise typecheckable?(where \"not otherwise typecheckable\" means types that can't be expressed with stubs - e.g., Django, dataclasses pre-PEP-681, pytest fixtures, etc.)\n \nreply",
      "At least for the moment, we aren't planning on a plugin architecture. We do recognize that there are some popular libraries and code patterns that aren't easily (or at all) typeable with the current state of the typing spec. We feel it would be more useful to help drive changes to the typing spec where we can, so that other type checkers can also benefit; and/or implement workarounds for the most popular libraries directly in ty, so that a library author doesn't have to rely on their downstream consumers installing a particular set of plugins to get good type-checker results.(It's also more difficult to support plugins effectively in a type checker like ty, than in a linter like ruff, since any non-trivial use case would likely require deep changes to how we represent types and how we implement type inference. That's not something that lends itself to a couple of simple hook extension points.)\n \nreply",
      "Helping improve the spec and all is great, but being 100% honest, as a user, I would rather have a type checker I can bend to my needs. As you said, some code patterns in a dynamic language like Python are difficult, or even impossible, to type-check without custom code. Type checkers are becoming more popular than ever, and this implicitly means that these code patterns are are going to be discouraged. On one hand, I believe the dynamism of Python is core to the language. On the other, I would never want to write any collaborative piece of software without a type checker anymore. Therefore, to get the benefits of a type checker, I am occasionally forced to write worse code just to please it.Considering how fast uv and ruff took off, I am sure you are aware of the impact your project could have. I understand that supporting plugins is hard. However, if you are considering adding support for some popular libraries, IMHO, it would be really beneficial for the community if you could evaluate the feasibility of implementing things in a somewhat generic way, which could be then maybe leveraged by third-party authors.In any case, thanks for all the amazing work.\n \nreply",

      "On linux there also is preadv2(..., RWF_NOWAIT) which can be used to do optimistic non-blocking read from the page cache. That might be useful for io_method = worker to shave off a bit of latency. Try reading on the main thread with NOWAIT and only offload to a worker thread when that fails.\n \nreply",
      "FWIW, I played with that - unfortunately it seems that the the overhead of doing twice the page cache lookups is a cure worse than the disease.Note that we do not offload IO to workers when doing I/O that the caller will synchronously wait for, just when the caller actually can do IO asynchronously. That reduces the need to avoid the offload cost.It turns out, as some of the results in Lukas' post show, that the offload to the worker is often actually beneficial particularly when the data is in the kernel page cache - it parallelizes the memory copy from kernel to userspace and postgres' checksum computation.   Particularly on Intel server CPUs, which have had pretty mediocre per-core memory bandwidth in the last ~ decade, memory bandwidth turns out to be a bottleneck for page cache access and checksum computations.Edit: Fix negation\n \nreply",
      "Ah yeah, getting good kernel<>userspace oneshot memcpy performance for large files is surprisingly hard. mmap has setup/teardown overhead that's significant for oneshot transfers, regular read/write calls suffer from page cache/per page overhead.\nHopefully all the large folio work in the kernel will help with that.\n \nreply",
      "From what I've seen a surprisingly large part of the overhead is due to SMAP when doing larger reads from the page cache - i.e. if I boot with clearcpuid=smap (not for prod use!), larger reads go significantly faster. On both Intel and AMD CPUs interestingly.On Intel it's also not hard to simply reach the per-core memory bandwidth with modern storage HW. This matters most prominently for writes by the checkpointing process, which needs to compute data checksums given the current postgres implementation (if enabled). But even for reads it can be a bottleneck, e.g. when prewarming the buffer pool after a restart.\n \nreply",
      "> if I boot with clearcpuid=smap (not for prod use!), larger reads go significantly faster.

      "It turns out to be the other way round, curiously. The bigger the reads (i.e. how much to read in one syscall) and the bigger the target area of the reads (how long before a target memory location is reused), the bigger the overhead of SMAP gets.If interesting I can dig up the reproducer I had at some point.\n \nreply",

      "I think the most interesting thing to me is they have multi-hop search & query refinement built in based on prior context/searches. I'm curious how well this works.I've built a lot of LLM applications with web browsing in it. Allow/block lists are easy to implement with most web search APIs, but multi-hop gets really hairy (and expensive) to do well because it usually requires context from the URLs themselves.The thing I'm still not seeing here that makes LLM web browsing particularly difficult is the mismatch between search result relevance vs LLM relevance. Getting a diverse list of links is great when searching Google because there is less context per query, but what I really need from an out-of-the-box LLM web browsing API is reranking based on the richer context provided by a message thread/prompt.For example, writing an article about the side effects of Accutane should err on the side of pulling in research articles first for higher quality information and not blog posts.It's possible to do this reranking decently well with LLMs (I do it in my \"agents\" that I've written), but I haven't seen this highlighted from anyone thus far, including in this announcement.\n \nreply",

      "The market for Google Analytics alternatives is crowded.

Despite minor differences these products all compete for the same users (e.g. if someone is a PostHog customer they probably won't be using Ahref web analytics) yet most of these companies offer generous free tiers while rybbit only a free trial.How do products like rybbit.io stay competitive without a similar free tier or major differentiation?

I can't run very big models on mine, obviously, but if I were an Enterprise I would.The key thing they'd need to nail to make this better than what's already out there is the integrations. If they can make it seamless to integrate with all the key third-party enterprise systems then they'll have something strong here, otherwise it's not obvious how much they're adding over Open WebUI, LibreChat, and the other self-hosted AI agent tooling that's already available.\n \nreply",

      "You might be able to get your clients to sign something to allow usage, but if you don't, as you say, it doesn't seem wise to vibe code for them. For two reasons:1. A typical contract transfers the rights to the work. The ownership of AI generated code is legally a wee bit disputed. If you modify and refactor generated code heavily it's probably fine, but if you just accept AI generated code en masse, making your client think that you wrote it and it is therefore their copyright, that seems dangerous.2. A typical contract or NDA also contains non disclosure, i.e. you can't share confidential information, e.g. code (including code you _just_ wrote, due to #1) with external parties or the general public willy nilly. Whether any terms of service assurances from OpenAI or Anthropic that your model inputs and outputs will probably not be used for training are legally sufficient, I have doubts.IANAL, and _perhaps_ I'm wrong about one or both of these, in one or more countries, but by and large I'd say the risk is not worth the benefit.I mostly use third party LLMs like I would StackOverflow: Don't post company code there verbatim, make an isolated example. And also don't paste from SO verbatim. I tried other ways of using LLMs for programming a few times in personal projects and can't say I worry about lower productivity with these limitations.

We saw this originally in \"Deviance in the Dark\" from the 70s, but anyone who's had experience with extremely online realms knows this to be the case as well. We even have pop TV shows exploring this phenomenon.I think what probably would be more interesting is an exploration to what clusters of personalities tend to develop or emerge in virtual worlds, across platforms, etc than attempting to make a research paper out of comments that escaped profanity filters.

      "I remember learning about FoundationDB a decade ago and being deeply impressed with what they built. Then it was acquired by Apple and went silent. Since then we've seen an explosion in new database storage layers.  I'm curious is FoundationDB still the new hotness or has it been replaced by newer better technologies?\n \nreply",
      "FoundationDB is pretty much the best distributed database out there, but it's more of a toolkit for building databases than a complete batteries-included database.I found that once I took the time to learn about FoundationDB and think about how to best integrate with it, the toolkit concept makes a lot of sense. Most people instinctively expect a database interface with a certain level of abstraction, and while that is nice to work with, it does not provide the advantages of a deeper integration.To take an example: FoundationDB itself has no indexing. It's a key-value store, but you get plenty of great tools for maintaining indices. That sounded strange to me, until I understood that now I can write my indexing functions in my app's language (Clojure in my case), using my model data. That is so much better than using a \"database language\" with a limited set of data types.Incidentally, I think that using SQL with FoundationDB is a waste, and I would not write a new app this way. Why would I want to talk to my database through a thin straw that mixes data with in-band commands?Since FoundationDB is hard to understand, there is (and will be) strong resistance to adoption. That's just how things are: we do not enjoy thinking too hard.\n \nreply",
      "FoundationDB's original promise was to combine a distributed storage engine with stateless layers on top to expose a variety of useful data structures (including SQL). The company was acquired before it could release the layers part of that equation. Apple open-sourced the core storage engine a few years later so FDB has kind of had a second life since then.In that second life, the vast majority of the powerful databases around the industry built on FoundationDB have been built by companies making their own custom layers that are not public. This release is cool because it's a rare case that a company that has built a non-trivial layer on top of FDB is letting that source code be seen.The group to which the FoundationDB storage engine itself appeals is fairly narrow--you have to want to go deep enough to build your own database/datastore, but not so deep to want to start from scratch. But, for this group, there is still nothing like FoundationDB in the industry--a distributed ACID KV store of extreme performance and robustness. So, yes, it's still the hotness in that sense.

      "This is a strange article to me. I've not seen any class that teaches Prolog place these constraints (use recursion / don't add new predicates) or even accidentally have the outcome of \"making prolog look tedious\". What's the joke here?That aside, I wonder if getting the reverse solution (sum(?, 10)) is better served by the straightforward or the tedious approach. I suspect both would work just the same, but I'd be curious if anyone knows otherwise.\n \nreply",
      "It's been a long time since I took a class like this, but I definitely had a similar experience to the author.Ideas like fold and map where _never_ mentioned in lisp (to exaggerate, every function had to have the recursive implementation with 5 state variables and then a simpler form for the initial call), at no point did higher-order functions or closures make an appearance while rotating a list by 1 and then 2 positions.The treatment of Prolog was somehow worse. Often the code only made any sense once you reversed what the lecturer was saying, realizing the arrow meant \"X given Y\" not \"X implies Y\", at which point, if you could imagine the variables ran \"backwards\" (unification was not explained) the outcome might start to seem _possible_. I expect the lecturer was as baffled by their presentation as we were.In general, it left the rest of the class believing quite strongly that languages other than Java were impossible to use and generally a bad move. I may have been relatively bitter in the course evaluation by the end.\n \nreply",
      "Thie irony is palpable. I had the (misfortune) of only being (mis)taught procedural languages by professors who thought computers were big calculators who could never be understood, but could be bent to your will by writing more code and maybe by getting a weird grad student to help.Patterns might appear to the enlighted on the zeroth or first instance, but even the mortal must notice them after several goes. The magic of lisp is that if you notice yourself doing anything more than once you can go ahead and abstract it out.Not everything needs to be lifted to functional valhalla of course, but not factoring out e.g. map and filter requires (imho) a wilful ignorance of the sort that no teacher should countenance. I think it's bad professional practise, bad pedagogy, and a bad time overall. I will die on this hill.\n \nreply",
      "I found the article to be hilarious.It's existence obviously means some professor didn't allow them to use the standard library and they tongue in cheek show how irritating that is.I'm sure it's possible they made it up, but we had similar restrictions where I could use an Arduino for my engineering Senior Design Project in college, but no Arduino or module libraries - just our own C. We passed, but barely. It also was weird as it didn't match how normal people would solve the problem.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, this line made it click:> Now this is starting to look like Professor of Programming Languages code!A lot of tier 2/3 CS schools with programming language courses (a survey of multiple languages across various paradigms) teach Prolog this way (and I've seen some fantastically terrible examples of Lisp code coming out of those same courses). It's unfortunate because, at these schools, this is often the only formal course where students branch out of C/Java/C++/C#/Python/JS (and they may only get 2-3 of those over the rest of their courses). It leaves the students with a gross misunderstanding of the languages and dread when they see them again.\n \nreply",
      "> It also was weird as it didn't match how normal people would solve the problem.If I can solve a problem by building from preexisting LEGO blocks then I'll probably do that, but it wouldn't be a valuable learning exercise. Students aren't being given problems in need of effective solution, these problems are tools to facilitate understanding.What you described could be pointless if it made you work on reimplementing trivial stuff that you'd already mastered long time ago instead of focusing on actual problem. Writing your 100th hashmap implementation or yet another I2C driver isn't particularly valuable. Since you mentioned \"barely passing\", I don't think that was the case though.\n \nreply",

You'd probably need to do an \"enumerate the rationals\" type of thing, since you need to go to infinity in a couple of different directions at the same time.

      "I interned at zed during the summer of 2022, when the editor was pre-alpha.  Nathan, Max, Antonio are great guys and build software with care. I'm happy to see the editor receive the success it deserves, because the team has poured so much world-class engineering work into it.I worked with Antonio on prototyping the extensions system[0]. In other words, Antonio got to stress test the pair programming collaboration tech while I ran around in a little corner of the zed codebase and asked a billion questions. While working on zed, Antonio taught me how to talk about code and make changes purposefully. I learned that the best solution is the one that shows the reader how it was derived. It was a great summer, as far as summers go!I'm glad the editor is open source and that people are willing to pay for well-engineered AI integrations; I think originally, before AI had taken off, the business model for zed was something along the lines of a per-seat model for teams that used collaborative features. I still use zed daily and I hope the team can keep working on it for a long time.[0]: Extensions were originally written in Lua, which didn't have the properties we wanted, so we moved to Wasm, which is fast + sandboxed + cross-language. After I left, it looks like Max and Marshall picked up the work and moved from the original serde+bincode ABI to Wasm interface types, which makes me happy: https://zed.dev/blog/zed-decoded-extensions. I have a blog post draft about the early history of Zed and how extensions with direct access to GPUI and CRDTs could turn Zed from a collaborative code editor into a full-blown collaborative application platform. The post needs a lot of work (and I should probably reach out to the team) before I publish it. And I have finals next week. Sigh. Some day!\n \nreply",

I am a full time zed user converting from sublime only due to the collaborative features, but by now we don't even use the collaborative features anymore because it's unreliable (broken connections, sounds, overwriting changes, weird history/undo behavior), so will probably go back to sublime again.
