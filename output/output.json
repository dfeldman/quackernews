      "Author here. I admit I am rather startled by the tone of many comments here and the accusations of disingenuity. Splitting hairs about the origin of the term \"sideload\" does not change the fact that those who promote the term tend to do so in order to make it feel deviant and hacker-ish. You don't \"sideload\" software on your Linux, Windows, or macOS computer: you install it.You have the right to install whatever you want on your computer, regardless of whether that computer is on your desk or in your pocket. That's a hill I'll die on. I'm dismayed to see that this sentiment is not more widespread in this of all communities.reply",

A vocal pocket. It's not everyone here. But it elicits comments justifying that stuff, which can feel surprising for those who don't share those views.reply",

As shown in the OP, it's substantially more powerful than most other models while at the same price-per-image, and due to its text encoder it can handle significantly larger and more nuanced prompts to get exactly what you want. I open-sourced a Python package for generating from it with examples (https://github.com/minimaxir/gemimg) and am currently working on a blog post with even more representative examples.

The shit part is that I enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed my shitty supermarket coffee back when I didn't know anything about coffee.\"That advice has stuck with me, and I try to have the least taste I can.

I got annoyed by my dull knives, so at first I went and bought really expensive knives, the ones made of hardened high-carbon steel that start rusting if you look at them dirtily. And I spent hours reading reviews before buying them. That's probably the \"most expensive cup of coffee\" stage.Then I stumbled upon a Youtube channel that explained how to sharpen knives properly. So I bought $70 worth of diamond sharpening stones and re-sharpened my old IKEA knives. And they started working almost as well as my set of ultra-expensive knives, but they are far more practical. The expensive knife set is now a display piece in my kitchen.Another revelation for me was that past a certain point, there's really not that much difference in the quality of sushi. It's just rice and sliced fish. Sure, there are individual variations between chefs in rice-to-fish ratio, maybe some special soy sauce here and there, but these are all just matters of personal taste.

These are likely to be much more secure against quantum computers as well (while they may be weakened, it is likely we have plenty of security margin left).Changing the key exchange or transport encryption protocols however is much, much easier, as it's negotiated and we can add new options right away.Certificates are the trickiest piece to change and upgrade, so even though Q-day is likely years away still, we need to start working on this now.Upgrading the key exchange has already happened because of the risk of capture-now, decrypt-later attacks, where you sniff traffic now and break it in the future.reply",

Let's Encrypt may start adding support the year after that. Downstream software might start deploying support MTCs the year after that. People using LTS Linux distros might not upgrade software for another 5 years after that.

      "I worked at a television station years back that was designed in such a way that the lights going up the tower were powered by the separate phases of three phase AC with the one at the top powered from all three combined. This was pretty normal but what the engineer had done was rotate them at every level so that if a phase was dropped you could count the lights and quickly see from a distance that the power wasn't right. 4 lights was good, 3 meant you dropped a phase, and so on. I thought it was a pretty clever way of keeping light on all sides of the tower while being able to tell from a distance that a phase was out.reply",
      "This is best practice for anyone who uses three phase power.A machine shop should connect 1/3 of their lights to each phase so it is immediately obvious if a phase gets dropped. Lots of equipment will suffer on two of three phases but with lower performance or even damage.reply",
      "I was told that you want lights on all 3 phases so that you can see spinning things spin. If the lights are on single phase, they will dim 120 times a second, and the strobe effect can cause spinning things to appear stationary. With 3 phase, at least 1/3 of the lights are lit all the time.reply",
      "That's a valid reason too. In an industrial environment full of rotating machines, thinking something is stationary because it's on the grid's natural frequency can be lethal.It's way less of a problem with modern machinery, and leds will blink in uncorrelated phases in a frequency that is different from the grid's anyway.reply",
      "> This is best practice for anyone who uses three phase power.No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a neat trick that visually reveals when the utility drops a phase, but there are better ways to handle avoiding equipment damage.Best practice is to use phase monitoring relays that can de-energize a motor when a phase is dropped/reversed to prevent damage. The trip time is adjustable and it\u2019s more reliable than manually hitting an e-stop. It also won\u2019t let a motor with incorrect phasing start up either. You see phase loss relays on a lot of compressor motors and other large motors.Here\u2019s a flyer for an Eaton product: https://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/products/industrialc...reply",

      "I have this happen outside of flights. Cupping your finger over the ANC mic is enough to trigger it.The new tips (that\u2019s my guess, at least) also transmit vibrations into your ears much more than the old tips or third party memory foam tips. This results in a popping noise when walking or moving around, and a horrible thumping sound when running with them in. I think the latter is partially caused by the \u201creduce loud noises\u201d feature incorrectly identifying vibrations from heel strikes as loud noise.I\u2019m glad I\u2019m apparently not the only one experiencing these issues. I hope they\u2019re software fixable. I filed a bug report, but radio silence on that, of course. I would sing the praises of the second gen AirPods Pro to anyone who would listen, but the 3rd gen have been a huge disappointment. I had to buy a different set of headphones for running, whereas the second gen were my daily drivers. And I\u2019ve been through three pair of the third gen, so it\u2019s not a one-off issue.reply",
      "I have been able to trigger it when fumbling around with adjusting the fit. If I run my finger over the top of the body I can get a brief squeal out of them. Happened just a few seconds ago. I also have noticed on multiple occasions that if I take them both out of my ears and cup them in the same hand, they squeal audibly enough to hear faintly from a couple feet away. The skin contact sensor is very sensitive.However, unlike a lot of other commenters in this thread, I feel like the APP3 are a huge leap forward from the APP2 and have had zero regrets with the upgrade (other than the forced iOS 26 upgrade, but I feel like that's inevitable anyway.) They stay in much better, the fit is more comfortable, the battery life is better, the ANC probably drops background noise another 10db subjectively, and most of all, the sound quality is absolutely stellar. I have owned several midrange headphones and a portable DAC and I find myself preferring the AirPods over them. I haven't worn my Sennheisers since I got the APP3.reply",
      "> (other than the forced iOS 26 upgrade, but I feel like that's inevitable anyway.)I'm using my Airpods Pro 3 with iOS 26 yes, but I stayed on macOS 15 (THANK GOD!) and I saw nothing unusual about using the new Airpods there except for the missing artwork.reply",
      "On macOS there were some issues but I can't say exactly because I returned my AirPods Pro 3.Other than the missing artwork and label, with AirPods Pro 3 on iOS 18 you also can't see the battery level, you can't take a Hearing Test, and more. After iOS 18.7.1 was released and didn't address any of these issues I reached out to Apple who said they wouldn't be adding any further support to iOS 18. So I returned my AirPods Pro 3, an easy decision. Just not worth the hassle for me.reply",
      "Just curious, which Sennheisers did you give up on in favor of APP3?I have over-the-ear Momentum 3 and love it, but if APP3 provides better sound quality and better ANC I might consider switching as Momentum 3, while I love it, is bulky, heavy, and started to wear off and break down.reply",

However, after running a hearing test and enabling Hearing Assist, the EQ on the Airpods is incredible and everything sounds very natural. I have no idea how they managed to get this much soundstage and bass out of these things. I also have a pair of Grado SR 80, and have a soft spot for Koss KSC 75.FWIW I got mine at Costco and their return policy is top notch, and I believe they include AppleCare+ with the purchase. I had bought my APP2 fairly recently before the APP3 were released, experienced buyers remorse, but had kept them in like new condition with the box and accessories, and had no problem exchanging them.reply",
      "Yep, I have the same exact story with the 2. Most times I move my right to fit in my ear it squeals.reply",
      "The horrible thumping is purely a fit issue. The solution to the thumping when running is to either size down the tips or to slightly dislodge the tips from your ear.It\u2019s not ideal, I\u2019ll grant you that.While we may have some overlap in issues, I would say that the Airpods Pro 3 are incredible. I\u2019ve ditched my Airpods Max entirely. The noise cancellation works too well, the sleep detection is a godsend, and the battery life is so good. I use my airpods to sleep. before, i\u2019d always wake up to dead airpods. now, they have like 70% batteries when i wake up, because the sleep detection kicks in.reply",
      "Seems odd to call it a fit issue when the solution is to make the fit worse by dislodging them from your ear. If it's a fit issue then improving the fit should make it go away!reply",
      "I\u2019ve tried with every set of tips except for the xs, same thumping with all of them. Zero issues running almost daily with the second gens for several years. I think it\u2019s more than fit\u2014either oversensitive ANC or something with the composition of the tips themselves. Oddly enough, it\u2019s not present in both ears every time. Sometimes both, sometimes just one, rarely neither. I\u2019ve stopped gathering data because I switched to a different set of headphones.I\u2019ll grant you that the ANC in the third gen is fantastic.

      "This article kind of grinds my gears.  I feel like there is an unstated assumption that people in pharma R&D are idiots and haven\u2019t thought of this stuff.Pharma companies care very much about off target effects.  Molecules get screened against tox targets, and a bad tox readout can be a death sentence for an entire program.  And you need to look at the toxicity of major metabolites too.One of the major value propositions of non small molecule modalities like biologics is specificity, and alternative metabolism pathways; no need to worry about the CYPs.Another thing they fail to account for is volume of distribution.  Does it matter if it hits some receptor only expressed in microglia if it can\u2019t cross the blood brain barrier?Also the reason why off targets for a lot of FDA approved drugs are unknown is because they were approved in the steampunk industrial era.To me this whole article reads like an advertisement for a screening assay.reply",

      "I fought insurance over this past summer after they declined covering a life saving surgery for my 6-year-old child at the last minute. We were in despair that my child's life was at risk each day we waited because of insurance incompetence.ChatGPT literally guided me through the whole external appeal process, who to contact outside of normal channels to ask for help / apply pressure, researched questions I had, helped with wording on the appeals, and yes, helped keep me pushing forward at some of the darkest moments when I was grasping for anything, however small, to help keep the pressure up on the insurance company.I didn't follow everything it suggested blindly. Definitely decided a few times to make decisions that differed from its advice partially or completely, and I sometimes ran suggested next steps by several close friends/family to make sure I wasn't missing something obvious. But the ideas/path ChatGPT suggested, the chasing down different scenarios to rule in/out them, and coaching me through this is what ultimately got movement on our case.10 days post denial, I was able to get the procedure approved from these efforts.21 days post denial and 7 days after the decision was reversed, we lucked into a surgery slot that opened up and my child got their life saving surgery. They have recovered and is in the best health of the past 18 months.This maybe isn't leveling the playing field, at least not entirely. But it gave us a fighting chance on a short timeline and know where to best use our pressure. The hopeful part of me is that many others can use similar techniques to win.reply",

      "I think the reason is that people know it is a problem but ideologically they really disagree about what to do about it.  The impasse creates an opportunity for profit driven actors to fight reforms. Also, democracies do dumb things sometimes.  See Brexit.But also, sometimes people from other countries-- I am thinking parts of Europe--  underestimate how well paid people in the US often are.  They compare the averages, like the US only makes 20% more per household, why do they put up with this or that.  But that comparison is for the whole country, so imagine if you were comparing all of Europe or China.I had a friend in Spain at a similar company as mine say, how can you put up with no safety net, etc. But I look at his company and every one at my company at any level gets paid 2-5x as much.  So like these are less serious issues if you are paid an extra $1-200k/ year.   It doesn't explain the inaction, but I believe it is why a lot of politically influential people don't care.reply",

And again, I am saying this as a non-European.reply",
      "> University is expensive as fck.One thing that's hard to understand from the outside is that almost nobody actually pays those mind-blowing $60K/year tuition prices. US universities charge on a sliding scale based on the applicants' families' ability to pay.For an extreme example: Harvard's tuition is nominally $60K per year, but for families earning $200K or less it's $0. Many prestigious universities follow similar patterns resulting in a large percentage of students paying no tuition, the middle ground of students paying some fraction, and a small number of students from wealthy families subsidizing everyone else.For those who don't attend the prestigious universities with large endowments, average in-state state-run University tuition is under $10K, though again a large percentage of students receive some form of aids or grants to bring that number down even further.That said, it's entirely possible or someone to go out and sign up for bad investment private university with no aid and rack up $300K of debt by graduation if they're not paying attention to anything, but it's a myth to think that everyone does this.The average US college student graduates with around $30-40K debt depending on whether they go public or private, which isn't all that hard to pay off when our wages are already significantly higher than other countries. We're especially lucky in tech where our compensation differential relative to other countries more than makes up for the cost of university education.reply",
      "> For those who don't attend the prestigious universities with large endowments, average in-state state-run University tuition is under $10K, though again a large percentage of students receive some form of aids or grants to bring that number down even further.This is an extremely important point that keeps getting ignored. People keep comparing _public_ schools in Europe to _private_ schools in America.To further your point, just about every place has a community college where you can do the first two years of your education for about half the price of the state school. The total tuition for this route (2 years at community college, 2 years at a state school) is going to average just under $30,000 for 4 years. Which is definitely in the \"work your way through college\" range.And this is before any financial assistance, which the majority of students receive.Foreigners talking about how crazy expensive college is in the U.S., but they're likely mislead by people who took out large loans to go to extremely expensive private colleges. There's an easy way to stop this kind of debt - don't allow federal loans for private institutions. But no one is really interested in stopping it.reply",

      "There's always this subtext that Europeans solve these problems just by caring more about human values, but the truth usually involves interesting sets of tradeoffs. So in Europe the norm, besides free university, is extensive tracking: in the US, your choice of major is essentially a consumer decision, where in many European systems it's fixed at a relatively early age by your performance on things like the Abitur.I'm not saying the European system is bad. Certainly there's a lot to complain about with a system that asks 18 year olds to make life-defining decisions about both their career and their financial prospects. But the differences do go beyond whether or not you're on the hook for your tuition.reply",
      "I agree that European schools are heavily tracked, but I\u2019m not seeing the connection between that and the tuition costs.It seems like these are unrelated issues.Does the wider freedom of choice in US education somehow cause college to cost more?

      "That's very exciting!  Thank you!reply",
      "Either Fil-C or a different implementation of the same idea seems essential to me.  A great deal of software has been written in C, and without some way of running it, we lose access to that intellectual heritage.  But pervasive security vulnerabilities mean that the traditional \"YOLO\" approach to C compilation is a bad idea for software that has to handle untrusted input, such as Web browsing or email.Pizlo seems to have found an astonishingly cheap way to do the necessary pointer checking, which hopefully I will be able to understand after more study.  (The part I'm still confused about is how InvisiCaps work with memcpy.)tialaramex points out that we shouldn't expect C programmers to be excited about Fil-C.  The point tialaramex mentions is \"DWIM\", like, accessing random memory and executing in constant time, but I think most C programmers won't be willing to take a 4\u00d7 performance hit.  After all, if they wanted to be using a slow language, they wouldn't be writing their code in C.  But I think that's the wrong place to look for interest: Fil-C's target audience is users of C programs, not authors of C programs.  We want the benefits of security and continued usage of existing working codebases, without having to pay the cost to rewrite everything in Rust or TypeScript or whatever.  And for many of us, much of the time, the performance hit may be acceptable.reply",

(Most of the C code that assumed you could put it in an int has been flushed out by now, but that was a big problem when the Alpha came out.)  I'm guessing that the amount of existing C code in Apple's bootloader is minimal, maybe 1000 lines, not the billions of lines you can compile with Fil-C.reply"

      "This guarantees I'll never buy a Samsung appliance. If they're this willing to screw with their customers today, they'll do it again tomorrow.Sadly, I'm including their TVs in this. I have one today, displaying the output of an Apple TV and not directly connected to the Internet because hah, no way, but I'll be shopping around when it comes time to replace it.Pity. They make nice stuff. Not nice enough that I'm willing to tolerate their anti-customer shenanigans, but otherwise decent quality.reply",
      "Samsung appliances have among the worst reputations for ease of repair and lifespan. Sadly most other brands are rebrands of Chinese conglomerates or not much better on the quality chain. But honestly it's also a lottery. We bought a fridge on sale for $500 as an emergency stopover when our expensive fridge was delayed by a month during a move, and it's still plugging along out in the garage, a hostile environment for fridges. All the parts are very accessible too which bodes well for repair, although the leveling feet did snap off.However, when you see the viral videos of \"dream fridges\" from the 1950s, it's important to remember that adjusted for inflation they would be something like $10k today. Of course they also last 10x as long, but you can still find fridges in that price range today with a similar value proposition. The question is whether or not you're willing to pay that upfront. I think we've all been so conditioned to accept that appliances go obsolete that it doesn't seem possible for a fridge like that to ever pay for itself.It's the boots theory at work.reply",
      "Maybe we need a new boots theory:The rich person buys a $3500 pair of boots that comes with surveillance, useless AI, and bricks itself on the next firmware update.The poor person buys a pair of boots, that are... boots.reply",
      "It's probably more like a rich person will spend $50 on a pair of boots that will last 10 years, while a poor person will spend $10 on a pair of boots that will last a year. The upper middle class person will spend the $40 on a pair of boots that comes with surveillance and useless AI, while a middle class person will spend $30 for the same, except it bricks itself on the next firmware update.reply",
      "\"You are so poor that when AWS goes down, you still can get into your house\" -- seen somewherereply",
      "It's hard to make the right boots analogy (try it yourself if you think you can), but to speak of fridges \u2014\u2022 The rich person's remodeller (or the developer of the house they buy) buys a commercial-kitchen prep fridge for the house's kitchen. This is a big, powerful, durable, repairable, no-frills, utilitarian fridge, that could be viewed as attractive or ugly depending on your opinion on brutalism. The rich person never sees this fridge. It's kept in the butler's pantry and only their private chef ever touches it.\u2022 The rich person's interior designer then buys an elegant/classy half-sized in-wall glass-door fridge to live in the kitchen itself. This is intended for the rich person's household staff to keep constantly stocked with snacks and drinks for the rich person to grab. (Also, if the rich person thinks they want to cook one day, the staff will prep the exact ingredients needed in advance, keeping them in the butler's pantry until called for, but will then stage any \"must stay cold\" ingredients here.) This fridge is generally a piece of shit, made with huge markups by companies that make fancy-house furniture. But it sure is pretty! If (when) it fails, the staff can temporarily revert to just serving the role of that fridge, running to the butler's-pantry fridge or other cold-storage area (maybe a walk-in!) when the rich person wants something. (Also compare/contrast: in-wall wine cooler.)\u2022 The rich person's household staff might respond to the rich person's request for more convenient access to snacks/drinks in certain areas of the house by buying + keeping stocked one or more minifridges. There'll certainly be one in the house's bar. (There's always a bar.) These are sturdy commercial-grade bricks, built by the same companies that build the ones that go into hotels; but these companies serve rich people just as often as they serve hotels, so they tend to have an up-market marque that makes the fridge look fancy while reusing the well-engineered core.reply",
      "Parent was funny but almost a non-sequitor.I appreciated the kernel of truth: industrial fridges will not come with adware in the foreseeable future. Buy industrial.reply",
      "I mean, my point was that there are actually three different ways you can spend a lot of money on a fridge, and it's a lot like with PCs.You can buy:\u2022 a big ugly powerful repairable/durable industrial one (like a server);\u2022 an average-sized, somewhat-fancy (because high-trim), repairable/durable commercial one (like a workstation);\u2022 or an average-sized fancy \"aesthetic\" one, made by a design company rather than an appliance company, that isn't repairable or durable (like one of those bespoke \"sleeper desk PCs.\")The same goes for most things you can spend a lot of money on. A sound system, a vacuum cleaner, a car, etc. In each of these cases, \"premium\" has these same three distinct meanings. None of which involve showing you ads. But all of which have their own trade-offs. And all of which are usually quite a bit more expensive (each for their own reasons) than the highest-trim product sold directly to the average consumer by what you'd think of as a \"consumer brand.\"reply",
      "Not that dissimilar to Wirecutter's advice on appliances: either buy the cheapest of the cheap because it'll have the fewest parts that can break, or the most expensive since it'll be built with high quality components and hopefully be repairable.https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/modern-appliances...reply",

      "I have had HTTPS-by-default for years and I can say that we're past the point where there's noticeable year-to-year change for which sites aren't HTTPS. It's almost always old stuff that pre-dates Let's Encrypt (and presumably just nobody ever added HTTPS). The news site which stopped updating in 2007, the blog somebody last posted to in 2011, that sort of thing.I think it's important to emphasise that although Tim's toy hypermedia system (the \"World Wide Web\") didn't come with baked in security, ordinary users have never really understood that. It seems to them as though http://foo.example/ must be guaranteed to be foo.example, just making that true by upgrading to HTTPS is way easier than somehow teaching billions of people that it wasn't true and then what they ought to do about that.I am reminded of the UK's APP scams. \"Authorized Push Payment\" was a situation where ordinary people think they're paying say, \"Big Law Firm\" but actually a scammer persuaded them to give money to an account they control because historically the UK's payment systems didn't care about names, so to it a payment to \"Big Law Firm\" acct #123456789 is the same as a payment to \"Jane Smith\" acct #123456789 even though you'd never get a bank to open you an account in the name of \"Big Law Firm\" without documents the scammer doesn't have. To fix this, today's UK payment systems treat the name as a required match not merely for your records, so when you say \"Big Law Firm\" and try to pay Jane's account because you've been scammed, the software says \"Wrong, are you being defrauded?\" and so you're safe 'cos you have no reason to fill out \"Jane Smith\" as that's not who you're intending to give money to.We could have tried to teach all the tens of millions of UK residents that the name was ignored and so they need other safeguards, but that's not practical. Upgrading payment systems to check the name was difficult but possible.reply",

      "For those outside the IT/networking realms, SFP use uniform connectors for both the networking device and the fiber cable, but the major vendors (Cisco and friends) have used firmware flags and settings to provide vendor lock-in for at least the last 15 years.It used to be that in the event of a major outage or hardware failure you would need to issue additional debug commands to the effect of \"I know this isn't your approved SFP but please just try it,\" if you were trying to replace a first party SFP with a third party one.  TAC would more or less laugh at you and hang up if you sought support.I'm not sure if this product will _actually_ change any of that, but here's hoping.reply",
      "> TAC would more or less laugh at you and hang up if you sought support.This is common belief and even a dire warning when filing TAC tickets. However, unless the third-party SFP is the prime suspect, I have never experienced a TAC from any major networking vendor[1] refuse support, let alone \"laugh and hang up,\" even metaphorically.It's good SOP to keep at least a couple SFPs for each networking manufacturer on the shelf, but third-party SFPs are normally in the ballpark of 10% of the cost of OEM and tend to be manufactured better[2].1. Mostly Cisco, Juniper, HPE, Fortinet2. I've had a far greater failure rate on OEM SFPs than SFPs from third-parties like Fs.com and USCritical. That and they feel much less flimsy than OEM.reply",
      "Before I comment, a disclaimer about my small scale. I am running probably three hundred SFP+s running and less than five years of experience with optics. I don't have stock tracking for the individual manufacturers, and the failure rate comments here are based on gut-feel only. (there will be other people here used to far larger scales)I bucket it into there being three options: genuine, clone, and good-clone.We had a bad run with fs.com QSFP+s. Their SFP+s have been better to me, but reckon I have had a couple fail.Atgbics SFP+s have been a reliable clone supplier for us. I don't think I have had any of those fail, and they have been my main vendor for a while now. You can order them programmed with personalities for Cisco, etc.Part of the edge of fs.com is that it is so easy to place an order and get fast delivery. My main site is in another country to where I live, and I do a few trips a year. Several times they have made low-notice projects possible.reply",
      "> Atgbics SFP+s have been a reliable clone supplier for us.With the caveat that I'm a USian and my scale is even lower than yours (10 10gbit SFP+ modules in my apartment combination home, office, and lab, running trouble-free for the past three years) I've found 10Gtek to be a reliable supplier. You can order 10gbit SFP+ modules straight from them for 14USD per per module. Though, shipping costs straight from them is currently pretty terrible: $35 if you're spending less than $800.Stores like Newegg will often meet or beat that per-module price and offer free shipping if you buy a bundle of four or more... but modules with the personality you want may not be in stock.reply",

      ">I'm not sure if this product will _actually_ change any of that, but here's hoping.SFP programmers have been around forever and work great. This will solve the issue. The only really unique thing here is the form factor and price.  I think the last time I looked at a programmer 8 years ago I seem to recall it was about 10x this price. I\u2019m guessing cheaper ones have popped up out of China since then.reply",
      "I have installed 100s of SFP connections and I've never had an issue with compatibility. I've never even heard of this. Is it just for some ultra high end products or something?reply",
      "It's more for enterprise gear than anything. For example, enterprise Cisco gear will absolutely reject non-cisco optics, but datacenter gear won't. As an example, the Nexus 9000 line accepts non-cisco optics by default. Granted, those are 10k+ boxes so somewhat high-end but nowhere near the ASR line.The nexus line being more modern in spirit also helps. Catalysts still reject non-cisco optics without a configuration line afaik.A good rule of thumb is whether the equipment tries to vendor-lock you in.Another example that comes to mind is at least one generation of Intel NICs (don't remember if it's the 5xx or the 7xx), where even the open-source mainline (!) driver will reject the optic without a driver argument passed to it when modprobe'ing it.reply"

      "Nokia today is the combination of the network businesses of Nokia, Siemens, Alcatel and Lucent.They have substantial operations in North America. T-Mobile uses primarily their hardware. Nokia still operates Bell Labs which came originally from AT&T via Lucent.As the other global options for network hardware are Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei, Nokia is the closest to a \u201cMade in USA\u201d solution. Its HQ is in Finland but at least it\u2019s a NATO country now.So they\u2019re more important to US infrastructure than might appear at first glance.reply",
      "Unless they bought back Siemens into NSN, I think not.I was part of the Nokia => NSN transition, and saw that S change back from Siemens into Solutions, with the money they got back from selling Nokia Mobile to Microsoft.reply",
      "Ericsson is swedish\nSamsung is south korean\nI can agree that Huawei is chinese so that's a bad choiceBut why is Ericsson(swedish), Samsung(south korean) not considered made in US in the sense that atleast south korea has strong relations with america iirc and also I just recently checked and it seems that sweden has also become a part of nato. So some of these can be just as good.Although I still agree that Nokia might be important in general but I just wanted to point/question it out I suppose.reply",

Would this fall under Jeffrey Sach's realm?reply",

      "Super interesting blogpost. I just wonder how this is actually different to LORA, since LORA also adds some parameters and freezes the rest of the model. This seems like a sparse, memory efficient LORA with a couple of extra steps, since it uses attention again to make the sparsity work. All while making it a lot more effective compared to LORA (performance drop of only 11% compared to 71%).reply",
      "I think the solution to continual learning is as simple as using context distillation. We know that models are good at in-context learning, so we just want an efficient way to distill context into the weights. I suspect context rot may come from how the softmax in attention gets diluted with a longer context, so this wouldn't be an issue with context distillation.reply",
      "Perhaps it can work through multiple stages: ICL -> prompt/context optimization (*)  -> prefix tuning / KV distillation -> context distillation.*: it is possible to measure how much part of a prompt helps with a task e.g. measuring change in entropyreply"

In this post, I\u2019ll motivate memory layers as a natural architecture for this paradigm: high-capacity, but sparse (few active parameters) on each forward pass. In our recent paper, we found that finetuning memory layers enables learning without forgetting much more effectively than LoRA. When learning TriviaQA facts, NaturalQuestions performance drops by 89% with full finetuning and 71% with LoRA, but only 11% with memory layers. Along the way, I\u2019ll also discuss the challenges of the continual learning problem broadly.Check out the paper here: Continual Learning via Sparse Memory FinetuningContinual learning has been studied for decades at this point.
