      "I've sometimes wondered how things would have been different if the TV pioneers had went with circular CRTs instead of rounded rectangles.Circles would have had a couple of advantages. First, I believe they would have been easier to make. From what I've read rectangles have more stress at the corners. Rounding the corners reduces that but it is still more than circles have. With circles they could have more easily made bigger CRTs.Second, there is no aspect ratio thus avoiding the whole problem of picking an aspect ratio.Electronically the signals to the XY deflectors to scan a spiral out from the center (or in from the edge if you prefer) on a circle are as easy to make as the signals to to scan in horizontal lines on a rectangle.As far as I can tell that would have been fine up until we got computers and wanted to use TV CRTs as computer displays. I can't imagine how to build a bitmapped interface for such a CRT that would not be a complete nightmare to deal with.reply",
      "I would guess that even at the time a circular viewport would have seemed a bit weird and so rectangular was preferred. After all, theater stages, most windows, photographs and books - all common place - aren\u2019t circular either.reply",
      "CRTs are peak steam punk technology. Analog, electric, kinda dangerous. Just totally mindblowing that we had these things in our living rooms shooting electric beams everywhere. I doubt it's environmentally friendly at all, but I'd love to see some new CRTs being made.reply",
      "There's a synchronous and instantaneous nature you don't find in modern designs.The image is not stored at any point.  The receiver and the transmitter are part of the same electric circuit in a certain sense.  It's a virtual circuit but the entire thing - transmitter and receiving unit alike - are oscillating in unison driven by a single clock.The image is never entirely realized as a complete thing, either.  While slow phosphor tubes do display a static image, most CRT systems used extremely fast phosphors; they release the majority of the light within a millisecond of the beam hitting them.  If you take a really fast exposure of a CRT display (say 1/100,000th of a second) you don't see the whole image on the photograph - only the most recently few drawn lines glow.   The image as a whole never exists at the same time.  It exists only in the persistence of vision.reply",
      "It doesn\u2019t begin at the transmitter either, in the earliest days even the camera was essentially part of the same circuit. Yes, the concept of filming a show and showing the film over the air existed eventually, but before that (and even after that, for live programming) the camera would scan the subject image (actors, etc) line-by-line and down a wire to the transmitter which would send it straight to your TV and into the electron beam.In fact in order to show a feed of only text/logos/etc in the earlier days, they would literally just point the camera at a physical object (like letters on a paper, etc) and broadcast from the camera directly. There wasn\u2019t really any other way to do it.reply",
      "Our station had an art department that used a hot press to create text boards that were set on an easel that had a camera pointed at it. By using a black background with white text you could merge the text camera with a camera in the studio and \"super-imposed the text into the video feed.\"And if you tell the kids that today, they won't believe it!\"reply",
      "> The image is not stored at any point.Just wanted to add one thing, not as a correction but just because I learned it recently and find it fascinating. PAL televisions (the color TV standard in Europe) actually do store one full horizontal scanline at a time, before any of it is drawn on the screen. This is due to a clever encoding used in this format where the TV actually needs to average two successive scan lines (phase-shifted compared to each other) to draw them. Supposedly this cancels out some forms of distortion. It is quite fascinating this was even possible with analogue technology. The line is stored in a delay line for 64 microseconds.\nSee e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsk4WWtRx6Mreply",
      "At some point, most NTSC TVs had delay lines, too. A comb filter was commonly used for separating the chroma from the luma, taking advantage of the chroma phase being flipped each line. Sophisticated comb filters would have multiple delay lines and logic to adaptively decide which to use. Some even delayed a whole field or frame, so you could say that in this case one or more frames were stored in the TV.https://www.extron.com/article/ntscdb3reply",
      "I only knew about SECAM, where it\u2019s even part of the name (Syst\u00e8me \u00c9lectronique Couleur Avec M\u00e9moire)reply",
      "All PAL TVs had a delay line in them? Crazy.reply"

      "Enterprise software tends to particularly bad because it's being sold to managers who won't use it themselves. Consumer software tends to be more user-friendly (or it won't sell), but popular software isn't always what you want.When writing software for yourself, there is a bias towards implementing just the features you want and never mind the rest. Sometimes the result can be pretty sloppy, but it works.However, code health is a choice. You just need to know what to ask for. A coding agent can be used as a power washer to tidy up a project. This won't result in great art, but like raking leaves or cleaning your steps or plowing a driveway, it can be satisfying.Just as you wouldn't use a power washer to clean a painting, maybe there's some code that's too delicate to use a coding agent on? But for a project that has good tests and isn't that delicate, which I believe includes most web apps, nobody's going to want to pay for you to do it by hand anymore.

      "Here's the one-minute version from the FAA.[1]Runway overrun areas marked with diagonal stripes have an Engineered Materials Arresting System. There are several different materials used. One is pumice embedded in styrofoam, with a thin concrete layer on top. Large aircraft weigh enough to break through, and the pumice is crushed to powder, absorbing energy. This yields a surprisingly short stopping distance. The aircraft landing gear will be damaged, but the rest of the aircraft is usually intact. The overrun material comes in prebuilt blocks, and after an overrun, only the ones damaged need to be replaced.It gets a lot of use. The FAA has logged 25 overruns stopped by EMAS, out of 161 runway ends so equipped. That's surprisingly high.It's a simple, clever system.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVSvU06_NGEreply",

      "I'm a co-founder of Calcapp, an app builder for formula-driven apps, and I recently received an email from a customer ending their subscription. They said they appreciated being able to kick the tires with Calcapp, but had now fully moved to an AI-based platform. So we're seeing this reality play out in real time.The next generation of Calcapp probably won't ship with a built-in LLM agent. Instead, it will expose all functionality via MCP (or whatever protocol replaces it in a few years). My bet is that users will bring their own agents -- agents that already have visibility into all their services and apps.I hope Calcapp has a bright future. At the same time, we're hedging by turning its formula engine into a developer-focused library and SaaS. I'm now working full-time on this new product and will do a Show HN once we're further along. It's been refreshing to work on something different after many years on an end-user-focused product.I do think there will still be a place for no-code and low-code tools. As others have noted, guardrails aren't necessarily a bad thing -- they can constrain LLMs in useful ways. I also suspect many \"citizen developers\" won't be comfortable with LLMs generating code they don't understand. With no-code and low-code, you can usually see and reason about everything the system is doing, and tweak it yourself. At least for now, that's a real advantage.reply",
      "Sorry to hear about the customer churn, but the MCP-first strategy makes sense to me and seems like it could be really powerful. I also suspect that the bring your own agent future will be really exciting, and I've been surprised we haven't seen more of it play out already.Agree there will be a place for no-code and low-code interfaces, but I do think it's an open question where the value capture will be--as SaaS vendors, or by the LLM providers themselves.reply",
      "I highly suggest you expose functionality through Graphql. It lets users send out an agent with a goal like: \"Figure out how to do X\" and because graphql has introspection, it can find stuff pretty reliably! It's really lovely as an end user. Best of luck!reply",
      "I think this view is really short-sighted. Low-code tools date back to the '80s, and the more likely outcome here is that low-code and agentic tools simply merge.There's a lot of value in having direct manipulation and visual introspection of UIs, data, and logic. Those things allow less technical people to understand what the agents are creating, and ask for help with more specific areas.The difficulty in the past has been 1) the amount of work it takes to build good direct manipulation tools - the level of detail you need to get to is overwhelming for most teams attempting it - but LLMs themselves make this a lot easier to build, and 2) what to do when users hit the inevitable gaps in your visual system. Now LLMs fill these gaps pretty spectacularly.reply",
      "This makes the most sense to me too. My feeling is so-called AI is going to deliver on a lot of the things we're used to having shoddy versions of -- good natural language interfaces, good WYSIWYG type tools, all of this could turn the wix/squarespace/wordpress/etc landscape into something pretty good, rather than just OK.In my most hopeful of futures, we've figured out how to do lightweight inference, and if the models don't run locally at least they aren't harming the planet, and all this AI tooling hydrates all the automation projects of the last 40 years so that my favorite tiny local music label can have a super custom online shop that works exactly the way they need without having to sacrifice significant income to do it.reply",
      "I agree. I think that once your LLM hits a baseline level of computer science / programming \"understanding\" it can pretty easily work with whatever language. Using narrow DSLs and low code platforms could be a great way to constraint an LLM and keep it on the happy path.reply",

      "My experience with using AI tools for code review is that they do find critical bugs (from my retrospective analysis, maybe 80% of the time), but the signal to noise ratio is poor. It's really hard to get it not to tell you 20 highly speculative reasons why the code is problematic along with the one critical error. And in almost all cases, sufficient human attention would also have identified the critical bug - so human attention is the primary bottleneck here.  Thus poor signal to noise ratio isn't a side issue, it's one of the core issues.As a result, I'm mostly using this selectively so far, and I wouldn't want it turned on by default for every PR.reply",
      "> but the signal to noise ratio is poorNail on the head. Every time I've seen it applied, its awful at this. However this is the one thing I loathe in human reviews as well, where people are leaving twenty comments about naming and then the actual FUNCTIONAL issue is just inside all of that mess. A good code reviewer knows how to just drop all the things that irk them and hyperfocus on what matters, if there's a functional issue with the code.I wonder if AI is ever gonna be able to conquer that one as its quite nuanced. If they do though, then I feel the industry as it is today, is kinda toast for a lot of developers, because outside of agency, this is the one thing we were sorta holding out on being not very automatable.reply",
      "Naming comments can be very useful in code that gets read by a lot of people. It can make the process of understanding the code much quicker.On the other hand, if it's less important code or the renaming is not clearly an improvement it can be quite useless. But I've met some developers who has the opinion of reviews as pointless and just say \"this works, just approve it already\" which can be very frustrating when it's a codebase with a lot of collaboration.reply",
      "Naming comments are useful when someone catches something like:1. you are violating a previously agreed upon standard for naming things2. inconsistent naming, eg some places you use \"catalog ID\" and other places you use \"item ID\" (using separate words and spaces here because case is irrelevant).3. the name you chose makes it easy to conflate two or more concepts in your system4. the name you chose calls into question whether you correctly understood the problem domain you are addressingI'm sure there are other good naming comments, but this is a reasonable representation of the kinds of things a good comment will address.However, most naming comments are just bike shedding.reply",
      "> Naming comments can be very useful in code that gets read by a lot of people. It can make the process of understanding the code much quicker.yes but it can be severely diminishing returns. Like lets step back a second and ask ourselves if:var itemCount = items.Count;vsvar numberOfItems = items.Count;is ever worth spending the time discussing, versus how much of a soft improvement it makes to the code base. I've literally been in a meeting room with three other senior engineers killing 30 minutes discussing this and I just think that's a complete waste of time. They're not wrong, the latter is clearer, but if you have a PR that improves the repo and you're holding it back because of something like this, then I don't think you have your priorities straight.reply",
      "Sorry for the dumb question, is the second version actually better than the first? Because I prefer the first. But perhaps you chose this as a particularly annoying/unuseful commentreply",
      "I personally don't give a shit either way but I've worked in dev shops with a clear preference for the second one. I can see their point because the code as natural language parses better but I don't think its strong enough to care about.Sort of place that is fussy about test naming so where I would do smth like:TestSearchCriteriaWherethey'd wantTest_That_Where_Clauses_In_Search_Criteria_WorkI think its a waste of typing but idk, I'm willing to let it slide because I think its a pointless hill to die on.reply",
      "They\u2019re both equally bad to me, I don\u2019t see the improvement over just using item.count. I may be nitpicking a toy example though.reply",
      "I think in this case itemCount had application in a couple of conditions later in the function, so there was value in extracting the count. In my recollection I might be missing some nuance, lets say for the sake of argument it was:var relevantCount = items.Where(x => x.SomeValue > 5);vsvar numberOfRelevantItems = items.Where(x => x.SomeValue > 5);so it wasn't necessarily cheap enough to want to repeat.reply",
      "Yeah or worse like my boss. We don't have a style guide. But he always wants style changes in every PR, and those style changes are some times contradictory across different PRs.Eventually I've told him \"if your comment does not affect performance or business logic, I'm ignoring it\".

      "Bayer dithering was also employed heavily on the original PlayStation. The PS1's GPU was capable of Gouraud shading with 24-bit color precision, but the limited capacity (1 MB) and bandwidth of VRAM made it preferable to use 16-bit framebuffers and textures. In an attempt to make the resulting color bands less noticeable, Sony thus added the ability to dither pixels written to the framebuffer on-the-fly using a 4x4 Bayer matrix hardcoded in the GPU [1]. On a period-accurate CRT TV using a cheap composite video cable, the picture would get blurred enough to hide away the dithering artifacts; obviously an emulator or a modern LCD TV will quickly reveal them, resulting in a distinct grainy look that is often replicated in modern \"PS1-style\" indie games.Interestingly enough, despite the GPU being completely incapable of \"true\" 24-bit rendering, Sony decided to ship the PS1 with a 24-bit video DAC and the ability to display 24-bit framebuffers regardless. This ended up being used mainly for title screens and video playback, as the PS1's hardware MJPEG decoder retained support for 24-bit output.[1]: https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/graphicsprocessingunitgpu/#24...reply",

Remember this was 2011.So they sent a police car to check out the area and found a suspiciously hot car. They noted it down and did some old-fashioned policing the rest of the summer. Two months later I got a call: they had found them and waited on them to continue stealing using the same MO, until they had a large enough stash that they could be charged with a worse crime.They had found my bag, my MacBook and my iPad.

We saw JavaScript everywhere, on the web, on the server with Node, on IoT devices, on Desktop with Electon, on Mobile with React Native, on Enterprise automation with Google Apps Script, even on Machine Learning applications with Tensorflow.js... even on places where the core is not written in JS like blockchain and NoSQL DBs, Javascript became"

      "Very cool! I am a good Tetris player (in the top 10% of players) and wanted to give brick yeeting against an LLM a spin.Some feedback:\n- Knowing the scoring system is helpful when going 1v1 high score- Use a different randomization system, I kept getting starved for pieces like I. True random is fine, throwing a copy of every piece into a bag and then drawing them one by one is better (7 bag), nearly random with some lookbehind to prevent getting a string of ZSZS is solid, too (TGM randomizer)- Piece rotation feels left-biased, and keeps making me mis-drop, like the T pieces shift to the left if you spin 4 times. Check out https://tetris.wiki/images/thumb/3/3d/SRS-pieces.png/300px-S... or https://tetris.wiki/images/b/b5/Tgm_basic_ars_description.pn... for examples of how other games are doing it.- Clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation is important for human players, we can only hit so many keys per second- re-mappable keys are also appreciatedNice work, I'm going to keep watching.reply",
      "I actually grew up playing the Spectrum HoloByte version of Tetris for PC, which only lets you rotate in one direction. As a result, I ended up playing NES Tetris for years as a kid before realizing it lets you rotate clockwise / counterclockwise!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(Spectrum_HoloByte)reply",
      "The worst thing is that the delayed auto shift is slightly off and it messes my finesse. (I used to play competitive tetris as well, but between getting older -> worse reflexes and vision problems I can't really play anymore. Weirdly, finesse muscle memory is still working.)I don't think the goal is to make a PvP simulator, it would be too easy to cheese or do weird strategies. It's mostly for LLMs to play.reply",
      "Hello fellow Tetris nerd with a -sort username :)On the topic of reflexes decaying (I'm getting there, in my late 30s): Have you played Stackflow? It's a number go up roguelite disguised as an arcade brick stacking game, but the gravity is low enough that it is effectively turn based. More about 'deck' building, less about chaining PCs and C-Spins.reply",
      "Stackflow looks nice! I'm a Balatro fan and I didn't know about this variant.By the way, kudos on your feedback. If I was OP, I would've been honored to get that type of fine-tuning comments.reply",
      "Thanks for all the questions! More details on how this works:- Each model starts with an initial optimization function for evaluating Tetris moves.- As the game progresses, the model sees the current board state and updates its algorithm\u2014adapting its strategy based on how the game is evolving.- The model continuously refines its optimizer. It decides when it needs to re-evaluate and when it should implement the next optimization function- The model generates updated code, executes it to score all placements, and picks the best move.- The reason I reframed this problem to a coding problem is Tetris is an optimization game in nature. At first I did try asking LLMs where to place each piece at every turn but models are just terrible at visual reasoning. What LLMs great at though is coding.reply",
      "Looks fun, but I'm not willing to give out my email address just to play a game.Also, if the creator is reading this, you should know that Tetris Holdings is extremely aggressive with their trademark enforcement.reply",
      "Interesting but frustratingly vague on details. How exactly are the models playing? Is it using some kind of PGN equivalent in Tetris that represents a on-going game, passing an ASCII representation, encoding as a JSON structure, or just directly sending screenshots of the game to the various LLMs?reply",
      "It has to be turn-based. Even with Flash's speed, the inference latency would kill you in a real-time loop. They're likely pausing the game state after every tick to wait for the API response before resuming.reply",
      "answered this in a comment above! It's not turn or visual layout based since LLMs are not trained that way. The representation is a JSON structure, but LLMs plug in algorithms and keeps optimizing it as the game state evolvesreply"

The pen is indeed mightier than the sword.reply",
      "One of my formative impressions of AI came from the depiction of the Colligatarch from Alan Dean Foster's The I Inside.The AI in the book is almost feels like it is the main message masquerading as a subplot.Asimov knew the risks, and I had assumed until fairly recently that the lessons and explorations that he had imparted into the Robot books had provided a level of cultural knowledge of what we were about to face.   Perhaps the movie of I Robot was a warning of how much the signal had decayed.I worry that we are sociologically unprepared, and sometimes it seems wilfully so.People discussed this potential in great detail decades ago,  Indeed the Sagan reference at the start of this post points to one of the significant contributors to the conversation, but it seems by the time it started happening, everyone had forgotten.People are talking in terms of who to blame, what will be taken from me,  and inevitability.Any talk of a future we might want dismissed as idealistic or hype.  Any depiction of a utopian future is met with derision far too often.  Even worse the depiction can be warped to an evil caricature of \"What they really meant\".How do we know what course to take if we can't talk about where we want to end up?reply",
      "My interpretation is that Asimov assumed that humans would require understanding at the deepest levels of artificial intelligence before it could be created. He built the robot concepts rooted in the mechanical world rather than the world of the integrated circuit.He never imagined, I suppose, that we would have the computing power necessary to just YOLO-dump the sum of all human knowledge into a few math problems and get really smart sounding responses generated in return.The risks can be generalized well enough. Man\u2019s hubris is its downfall etc etc.But the specific issues we are dealing with have little to do with us feeling safe and protected behind some immutable rules that are built into the system.reply",
      "I think people broadly feel like all of this is happening inevitably or being done by others. The alignment people struggle to get their version of AI to market first - the techies worry about being left behind. No one ends up being in a position to steer things or have any influence over the future in the race to keep up.So what can you and I do? I know in my gut that imagining an ideal outcome won't change what actually happens, and neither will criticizing it really.reply",
      "In the large, ideas can have a massive influence on what happens. This inevitability that you're expressing is itself one of those ideas.Shifts of dominant ideas can only come about through discussions. And sure, individuals can't control what happens. That's unrealistic in a world of billions. But each of us is invariably putting a little but of pressure in some direction. Ironically, you are doing that with your comment even while expressing the supposed futility of it. And overall, all these little pressures do add up.reply",
      ">So what can you and I do?Engage respectfully, Try and see other points of view,  Try and express your point of view.   I decided some time ago that I would attempt to continue conversations on here to try and at least get people to understand that other points of view could be held by rational people.   It has certainly cost me Karma, but I hope there has been a small amount of influence.   Quite often people do not change their minds by losing arguments, but by seeing other points of view and then given time to reflect.>I know in my gut that imagining an ideal outcome won't change what actually happensYou might find that saying what you would like to see doesn't get heard, but you just have to remember that you can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant (if that is not too oblique of a reference)Talk about what you would like to see,   If others would like to see that too, then they might join you.I think most people working in AI are doing so in good faith and are doing what they think is best.   There are plenty of voices telling them how not to it, many of those voices are contradictory.  The instances of people saying what to do instead are much fewer.If you declare that events are inevitable  then you have lost.   If you characterise Sam Altman as a sociopath playing the long game of hiding in research for years just waiting to pounce on the AI technology that nobody thought was imminent, then you have created a world in you mind where you cannot win.  By imagining an adversary without morality it's easy to abdicate the responsibility of changing their mind,  you can simply declare it can't be done.  Once again choosing inevitability.Perhaps try and imagine the world you want and just try and push a tiny fraction towards that world.    If you are stuck in a seaside cave and the ocean is coming in, instead of pushing the ocean back, look to see if there is an exit at the other end,  maybe there isn't one,  but at least go looking for it, because if there is, that's how you find it.reply",
      "Hypothetically, however, if your adversary is indeed without morality, then failing to acknowledge that means working with invalid assumptions. Laboring under a falsehood will not help you. Truth gives you clear eyed access to all of your options.You may prefer to assume that your opponent is fundamentally virtuous. It's valid to prefer failing under your own values than giving them up in the hopes of winning. Still, you can at least know that is what you are doing, rather than failing and not even knowing why.reply",

      "Some people say that human jobs will move to the physical world, which avoids the whole category of \u201ccognitive labor\u201d where AI is progressing so rapidly. I am not sure how safe this is, either. A lot of physical labor is already being done by machines (e.g., manufacturing) or will soon be done by machines (e.g., driving). Also, sufficiently powerful AI will be able to accelerate the development of robots, and then control those robots in the physical world.I would like to believe that we're about to see a rapid proliferation of useful robots, but progress has been much slower with the physical world than with information-based tasks.After the DARPA Urban Challenge of 2007, I thought that massive job losses from robotic car and truck drivers were only 5-8 years away. But in 2026 in the US only Waymo has highly autonomous driving systems, in only a few markets. Most embodied tasks don't even have that modest level of demonstrated capability.I actually worry that legislators -- people with white collar jobs -- will overestimate the near-term capabilities of AI to handle jobs in general, and prematurely build solutions for a \"world without work\" that will be slow to arrive. (Like starting UBI too early instead of boosting job retraining, leaving health care systems understaffed for hands-on work.)reply",

If LLM's really delivered 10x productivity improvements, as claimed by some, then we should by now be seeing an explosion of productivity out of Microsoft.  It's been a couple years, so if it really helps then we should see it by now.So, either LLM-assisted coding is not delivering the benefits some thought it would, or Microsoft, despite being an early investor in OpenAI, is not using it much internally on things that really matter to them (like Windows).  Either way, I'm not impressed.reply",
      "I know blaming everything on LLMs is in vogue right now; but this is much more to do with Microsoft very publically firing the QA department[0][1] as a cost savings measure and claiming developers will do their own QA (long before LLMs were on the scene). It started in 2014 and the trickle never stopped.Microsoft has a cultural problem; it went from an \"engineers\" company to an MBA directed one, trying to maximize short-term shareholder value at the cost of long-term company reputation/growth.

Afterward, the ratio was closer to one to one. As a precursor to these layoffs and the shifting roles of development and testing, the OSG renamed its test team to \u201cQuality.\u201dTwo QA per dev??  That seems ginormous to me.  What am I missing about the narrative about evil corp sending all of QA packing, that seems not supported here?The second, Reuters article seems like it's saying something different than the QA firing narrative - it seems to talk about Nokia acquisition specifically and a smattering of layoffs.Not supporting layoffs or eliminating QA, and I'm deeply annoyed at Windows 11. I just don't see these as supportive of the narrative here that QA is kaput.reply",

A dev just bangs out code on what is assumed \"happy path\" which means the user uses it as the dev expects. QA has to some how think of all the inane ways that a user will actually try using the thing knowing that not all users are technically savvy at all. They are actively trying to break things not just feed in clean data to produce expected outputs. Let's face it, that's exactly what devs do when they \"test\". They are specifically trying to get unexpected outputs to see how things behave. At least, good QA teams do.I worked with a QA person who I actively told anyone that listened that the specific QA person deserved a higher salary than I did as the dev. They caught some crazy situations where product was much better after fixing.reply",

At that time they were running circles around Windows XP/7 in terms of new features.  They were actually selling the new OSes and folks were happy to pay for each roughly annual upgrade.

You feed it a giant set of CSVs, if it was not RL'd to do something useful with it, it will just try to make whatever sense of it and generate something that will most probably have no strong numerical relationship to your data, it will simulate an analysis, it won't do it.You may have a giant context windows, but attention is sparse, the attention mechanism doesn't see your whole data at the same time, it can do some simple comparisons, like figuring out that if I say my current pressure is 210X180 I should call an ER immediately. But once I send it a time-series of my twice a day blood-pressure measurements for the last 10 years, it can't make any real sense of it.Indeed, it would have been better for the author to ask the LLM to generate a python notebook to do some data analysis on it, and then run the notebook and share the result with the doctor.reply",
      "Health metrics are absolutely tarnished by a lack of proper context. Unsurprisingly, it turns out that you can't reliably take a concept as broad as health and reduce it to a number. We see the same arguments over and over with body fat percentages, vo2 max estimates, BMI, lactate thresholds, resting heart rate, HRV, and more. These are all useful metrics, but it's important to consider them in the proper context that each of them deserve.This article gave an LLM a bunch of health metrics and then asked it to reduce it to a single score, didn't tell us any of the actual metric values, and then compared that to a doctor's opinion. Why anyone would expect these to align is beyond my understanding.The most obvious thing that jumps out to me is that I've noticed doctors generally, for better or worse, consider \"health\" much differently than the fitness community does. It's different toolsets and different goals. If this person's VO2 max estimate was under 30, that's objectively a poor VO2 max by most standards, and an LLM trained on the internet's entire repository of fitness discussion is likely going to give this person a bad score in terms of cardio fitness. But a doctor who sees a person come in who isn't complaining about anything in particular, moves around fine, doesn't have risk factors like age or family history, and has good metrics on a blood test is probably going to say they're in fine cardio health regardless of what their wearable says.I'd go so far to say this is probably the case for most people. Your average person is in really poor fitness-shape but just fine health-shape.reply",
      "> Despite having access to my weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, ChatGPT based much of its negative assessment on an Apple Watch measurement known as VO2 max, the maximum amount of oxygen your body can consume during exercise. Apple says it collects an \u201cestimate\u201d of VO2 max, but the real thing requires a treadmill and a mask. Apple says its cardio fitness measures have been validated, but independent researchers have found those estimates can run low \u2014 by an average of 13 percent.There's plenty of blame to go around for everyone, but at least for some of it (such as the above) I think the blame more rests on Apple for falsely representing the quality of their product (and TFA seems pretty clearly to be blasting OpenAI for this, not others like Apple).What would you expect the behavior of the AI to be?  Should it always assume bad data or potentially bad data?  If so, that seems like it would defeat the point of having data at all as you could never draw any conclusions from it.  Even disregarding statistical outliers, it's not at all clear what part of the data is \"good\" vs \"unrealiable\" especially when the company that collected that data claims that it's good data.reply",

      "The paper itself: https://www.apple.com/healthcare/docs/site/Using_Apple_Watch...Seems like Apple's 95% accuracy estimate for VO2 max holds up.  Thirty participants wore an Apple Watch for 5-10 days to generate a VO2 max estimate. Subsequently, they underwent a maximal exercise treadmill test in accordance with the modified \u00c5strand protocol. The agreement between measurements from Apple Watch and indirect calorimetry was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute error (MAE).\n\n  Overall, Apple Watch underestimated VO2 max, with a mean difference of 6.07 mL/kg/min (95% CI 3.77\u20138.38). Limits of agreement indicated variability between measurement methods (lower -6.11 mL/kg/min; upper 18.26 mL/kg/min). MAPE was calculated as 13.31% (95% CI 10.01\u201316.61), and MAE was 6.92 mL/kg/min (95% CI 4.89\u20138.94).\n\n  These findings indicate that Apple Watch VO2 max estimates require further refinement prior to clinical implementation.

      "Americans fail to appreciate a few things about our economy1. We have a large homgoneous market where you can build a product and it\u2019s expected it can succeed for hundreds of millions of Americans2. EU is the easiest second market, and another step change of hundreds of millions of customers in a somewhat unified market3. there\u2019s not an easy 3rd economy that replaces EUs wealth, population, and comfort with English + technologyWhen we piss everyone off in the EU tech company growth gets kneecapped and limited to US / Canada. Theres not an easy market to expand to without much deeper focus on that specific market and its needs, for much fewer returns.reply",
      "Don't take the Canadian market for granted.There's a strong desire to forge closer links with the EU now and reduce dependence on products that could be weaponized against us at any time.  Geographic proximity doesn't count for much when it comes to software.reply",
      "It should also go without saying that Canada already had a vertically integrated telecoms giant in RIM/Blackberry that handled end to end smartphone comms globally in the 3G era, right down to compressing emails through their servers so they could be transmitted efficiently over 2G data networks.Unfortunately Blackberry was heavily dependent on US telecoms and corporations buying their servers and devices to pad their profits. And since then, local engineering talent from the Kitchener-Waterloo region has been siphoned off by Silicon Valley money, mostly to craft elegant solutions to deliver more ads to your devices.reply",
      "Canada's telcos are a \"narrow waist\" for a lot of software licensing.A lot of business customers bundle their business/productivity software with their phone and Internet services. Did you know you can buy Google Workspace and/or Microsoft Office through your telco?   I was shocked to find out how many do this when I worked for one of the telcos.Just like how consumers bundle their streaming services with their home Internet plans.One bill for all the things is convenient.I would bet it's the same in EU (but can't say for sure, I only have first-hand info about Canada).If there was a real push to move companies away from these platforms, it would probably start there, mostly because the telcos are typically very government-aligned due to regulatory and spectrum concerns, and would get in line with government efforts to promote non-US alternatives, if they decided to.Getting the majority of consumers to ditch their US-based streaming and entertainment is another thing though, I can't see that happening ever, no matter how at-odds the US and Canada become.reply",
      "Not only software. Think back to who supplied the vaccines during COVID.reply",
      "The British and the Russians also had a COVID vaccine (and much cheaper), and the French cancelled theirs because they realized it would come too late to be competitive.So if they were restricted to some reason to use their own only, they would be fine.reply",
      "> weaponized against usI take a more optimistic stance here. Trump can only live so long, and everybody except basically Trump and John Bolton knows that the majority of his idiotic tariffs (and nonsensical belligerence like pretending NATO control of Greenland doesn't meet all our defense needs) are wealth-destroying on net, as well as wealth-destroying for at least 10x the number of people than they help (many of them I'd say 100-1000x as many). When Trump leaves the stage, those who replace him will either be Democrats sprinting at full speed from all his policies to demonstrate how not-Trump they are, or Republicans who want to grow the economy. Either way, the stupidity in a lot of his policies is a temporary condition.Note that I'm not saying everyone should give the US a pass or maintain as much economic and defense dependency on the US. But I think it's hyperbolic to make all your long-term plans assuming something as stupid and self-defeating as his worst anti-ally policies are a new normal, because they harm the US at least as much as they harm everyone else, and everyone but those two knows this.reply",
      "MAGA will likely not die with Trump, and the Democrats have done their fair share to shaft Canada too.  (If Jimmy Carter were still alive you could ask him about his family tree farm and what he thinks of softwood lumber tariffs.)  As our PM recently said in Davos, the U.S.-led rules-based world order was a bit of a sham from the get-go.  Certain countries were more equal than others.  The rules were always flexible and they bent in favour of the U.S. most of all.  Canada and other middle powers got an okay deal nonetheless, so we went along with it.  That's over now, and \"Nostalgia is not a strategy.\".Now that we're always going to be four years or less from the next potential bout of American insanity, it's time to build a new order that is less vulnerable to big powers and more equitable for everyone else.  An order in which the rules are applied more consistently and have teeth. That doesn't necessarily mean breaking out the feather quills and having a big shin-dig at Versailles though.  It's doing lots of little things that shift our dependence to like-minded middle powers whenever and wherever possible.e.g. The white house has threatened other countries (including Canada) with tariffs in order to deter regulation or taxation of american software giants in non-U.S. jurisdictions.  That makes dependence on these companies an exploitable (and already exploited) weakness.  This is why governments, like France, want alternatives.reply",
      "It seems optimistic to me at this point that he could be replaced by a Republican not largely crafted in his image. It's possible, but I certainly wouldn't take it for granted.reply",
      "> Note that I'm not saying everyone should give the US a pass or maintain as much economic and defense dependency on the US. But I think it's hyperbolic to make all your long-term plans assuming something as stupid and self-defeating as his worst anti-ally policies are a new normal, because they harm the US at least as much as they harm everyone else, and everyone but those two knows this.It is debatable if everyone but John Bolton and Donald Trump knows this. After all, according to the last NYT poll the current POTUS commands an approval rating of 41 % in the USA. The number of people I meet who do not understand how tariffs work, for example, is staggering.Anyway, it is smart policy to expect the worst and plan for it instead of being surprised by another insane president voted in by the people of the USA. Call it risk management if you like. It would be negligent of the leaders of the EU and its member nations to not account for that. The EU has to reduce dependence on unrealiable trade partners, this is true whether we are talking about warmongering Russia, dictatorial China (probably the most reliable of the three!), or unpredictable USA.So, let's hope for the best and prepare for the worst. The EU can't change it if preparation harms US economic interests in the long run. That's on Trump.reply"

You can climb the ladder to staff engineer and above, or you can take it easy and focus on your hobbies.
