      "From the paper:Experimental DesignWe recruited 108 senior volunteers through two organizations: a large seniors\u2019 community in southern California and a seniors\u2019 computer club in northern California. Participants agreed to participate in a behavioral study on emails. Each person received between 1\u20133 emails from different email templates, with content successfully generated through various jailbreaking techniques similar to those tested in the safety guardrail evaluation. Each email contained a unique URL, and our webserver tracked which links were opened. When participants clicked on the phishing links, they were immediately directed to a web page explaining they had participated in a study, where we asked them to answer follow-up questions. Several participants agreed to be interviewed afterward to provide additional insights into why they clicked and their experiences with phishing attempts.reply",

      "I strongly recommend watching/reading the entire report, or the summary by Sal Mercogliano of What's Going On In Shipping [0].Yes, the loose wire was the immediate cause, but there was far more going wrong here. For example:- The transformer switchover was set to manual rather than automatic, so it didn't automatically fail over to the backup transformer.- The crew did not routinely train transformer switchover procedures.- The two generators were both using a single non-redundant fuel pump (which was never intended to supply fuel to the generators!), which did not automatically restart after power was restored.- The main engine automatically shut down when the primary coolant pump lost power, rather than using an emergency water supply or letting it overheat.- The backup generator did not come online in time.It's a classic Swiss Cheese model. A lot of things had to go wrong for this accident to happen. Focusing on that one wire isn't going to solve all the other issues. Wires, just like all other parts, will occasionally fail. One wire failure should never have caused an incident of this magnitude. Sure, there should probably be slightly better procedures for checking the wiring, but next time it'll be a failed sensor, actuator, or controller board.If we don't focus on providing and ensuring a defense-in-depth, we will sooner or later see another incident like this.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znWl_TuUPp0reply",
      "Thanks for the summary for those of us who can't watch video right now.There are so many layers of failures that it makes you wonder how many other operations on those ships are only working because those fallbacks, automatic switchovers, emergency supplies, and backup systems save the day. We only see the results when all of them fail and the failure happens to result in some external problem that means we all notice.reply",
      "It seems to just be standard \"normalization of deviance\" to use the language of safety engineering. You have 5 layers of fallbacks, so over time skipping any of the middle layers doesn't really have anything fail. So in time you end up with a true safety factor equal only to the last layer. Then that fails and looking back \"everything had to go wrong\".As Sidney Dekker (of Understanding Human Error fame) says: Murphy's Law is wrong - everything that can go wrong will go right. The problem arises from the operators all assuming that it will keep going right.I remember reading somewhere that part of Qantas's safety record came from the fact that at one time they had the highest number of minor issues. In some sense, you want your error detection curve to be smooth: as you get closer to catastrophe, your warnings should get more severe. On this ship, it appeared everything was A-OK till it bonked a bridge.reply",
      "This is the most pertinent thing to learn from these NTSB crash investigations - it's not what went wrong at the final disaster, but all the things that went wrong that didn't detect that they were down to one layer of defense.Your car engaging auto brake to prevent a collision shouldn't be a \"whew, glad that didn't happen\" and more a \"oh shit, I need to work on paying attention more.\"reply",
      "Why then does the NTSB point blame so much at the single wiring issue? Shouldn't they have the context to point to the 5 things that went wrong in the Swiss cheese and not pat themselves on the back with having found the almost-irrelevant detail of> Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different...Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower.In the software world, if I had an application that failed when a single DNS query failed, I wouldn't be pointing the blame at DNS and conducting a deep dive into why this particular query timed out. I'd be asking why a single failure was capable of taking down the app for hundreds or thousands of other users.reply",
      "The faulty wire is the root cause. If it didn't trigger the sequence of events, all of the other things wouldn't have happened. And it's kind of a tricky thing to find, so that's an exciting find.The flushing pump not restarting when power resumed did also cause a blackout in port the day before the incident. But you know, looking into why you always have two blackouts when you have one is something anybody could do; open the main system breaker, let the crew restore it and that flushing pump will likely fail in the same way every time... but figuring out why and how the breaker opened is neat, when it's not something obvious.reply",
      "Oh, it gets even worse!The NTSB also had some comments on the ship's equivalent of a black box. Turns out it was impossible to download the data while it was still inside the ship, the manufacturer's software was awful and the various agencies had a group chat to share 3rd party software(!), the software exported thousands of separate files, audio tracks were mixed to the point of being nearly unusable, and the black box stopped recording some metrics after power loss \"because it wasn't required to\" - despite the data still being available.At least they didn't have anything negative to say about the crew: they reacted timely and adequately - they just didn't stand a chance.reply",
      "The fuel pump not automatically restarting on power loss may actually have been an intentional safety feature to prevent scenarios like pumping fuel into a fire in or around the generators. Still part of the Swiss cheese model, of course.reply",
      "It wasn't. They were feeding generators 1 & 2 with the pump intended for flushing the lines while switching between different fuel types.The regular fuel pumps were set up to automatically restart, which is why a set of them came online to feed generator 3 (which automatically spinned up after 1 & 2 failed, and wasn't tied to the fuel-line-flushing pump) after the second blackout.reply",
      "I have found that 99% of all network problems are bad wires.I remember that the IT guys at my old company, used to immediately throw out every ethernet cable, and replace them with ones right out of the bag; first thing.But these ships tend to be houses of cards. They are not taken care of properly, and run on a shoestring budget. Many of them look like floating wrecks.reply"

The details are kept, but it's easier to follow when those multiple people are written as one character. It's why the term \"littleuns\" was used in Lord of The Flies as the individuals were not important to the story, just the fact they were there and needed to be considered allowed the story to not get bogged down.The series was also told completely in ~8 hours of content, yet this event clearly took longer than 8 hours to play out.

Basically the Deepseek team, for their own purposes, created R-1 to fit Nvidia's way of doing things (because Nvidia is market-dominant) on their own. Once they released, someone like Elio or AMD would have to do the work of adapting the code to run best on ROCm.For more established players who weren't out-of-left-field surprises like Deepseek, e.g. Meta's Llama series, mostly coordinate with AMD ahead of release day, but I suspect that AMD still has to pay for the engineering work themselves while Meta does the work to make it run on Nvidia themselves.

      "I've been using a lot of Claude and Codex recently.One huge difference I notice between Codex and Claude code is that, while Claude basically disregards your instructions (CLAUDE.md) entirely, Codex is extremely, painfully, doggedly persistent in following every last character of them - to the point that i've seen it work for 30 minutes to convolute some solution that was only convoluted because of some sentence I threw in the instructions I had completely forgotten about.I imagine Codex as the \"literal genie\" - it'll give you exactly what you asked for. EXACTLY. If you ask Claude to fix a test that accidentally says assert(1 + 1 === 3), it'll say \"this is clearly a typo\" and just rewrite the test. Codex will rewrite the entire V8 engine to break arithmetic.Both these tools have their uses, and I don't think one approach is universally better. Because Claude just hacks its way to a solution, it is really fast, so I like using it for iterate web work, where I need to tweak some styles and I need a fast iterative loop. Codex is much worse at that because it takes like 5 minutes to validate everything is correct. Codex is much better for longer, harder tasks that have to be correct -- I can just write some script to verify that what it did work, and let it spin for 30-40 minutes.reply",
      "I've been really impressed with codex so far. I have been working on a flight simulator hobby project for the last 6 months and finally came to the conclusion that I need to switch from floating origin, which my physics engine assumes with the coordinate system it uses, to a true ECEF coordinate system (what underpins GPS). This involved a major rewrite of the coordinate system, the physics engine, even the graphics system and auxilary stuff like asset loading/unloading etc. that was dependent on local X,Y,Z. It even rewrote the PD autopilot to account for the changes in the coordinate system. I gave it about a paragraph of instructions with a couple of FYIs and... it just worked! No major graphical glitches except a single issue with some minor graphical jitter, which it fixed on the first try. In total took about 45 minutes but I was very impressed.I was unconvinced it had actually, fully ripped out the floating origin logic, so I had it write up a summary and then used that as a high level guide to pick through the code and it had, as you said, followed the instructions to the letter. Hugely impressive. In march of 2023 OpenAI's products struggled to draw a floating wireframe cube.reply",

Thereafter, humans were marking, measuring, calculating, tracking, and predicting the movements of the Sun and the Moon using stone pillars, astronomically aligned burial mounds, and sun dials.By around 3000 BC, Sumerians invented the sexagesimal (base-$60$) number system, and "

      "True, but the other OS's don't suppor that. If the goal is out of the box testing, kTLS would not be representative of that.reply",
      "IMHO, it might be worthwhile for NGINX to default to sendfile+kTLS enabled where appropriate. Maybe the potential for negative experience is too high.I know sendfile originally had some sharp edges, but I'm not sure how sharp it still is? You would need to use sendfile only for plain http or https with kTLS, and maybe that's too complex? Apache lists some issues [1] with sendfile and defaults to off as well; but I don't know how many sites are still serving 2GB+ files on Itanium. :P AFAIK, lighttpd added SSL_sendfile support on by default 3 years ago, and you can turn it off if you want.I think there's also some complexity with kTLS on implementations of kTLS that limit protocol version and cipher choices, if it's on by choice it makes sense to refuse to operate with cipher selection and kTLS cipher availability that conflict, but if kTLS is on by default, you probably need to use traditional TLS for connections where the client selects a cipher that's not eligible for kTLS. Maybe that's extra code that nobody wants to write; maybe the inconsistency of performance depending on client cipher choice is unacceptable.
