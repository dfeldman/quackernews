      "It's not quite as dangerous as you'd think.The standard technique is to reserve a big file on the old filesystem for the new filesystem metadata, and then walk all files on the old filesystem and use fiemap() to create new extents that point to the existing data - only writing to the space you reserved.You only overwrite the superblock at the very end, and you can verify that the old and new filesystems have the same contents before you do.\n \nreply",
      "I believe that is also the method [btrfs-convert](https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Convert.html) uses. A cool trick that tool uses is to keep the ext4 structures on disk (as a subvolume), which allows reverting to ext4 if the conversion didn't go as planned (as long as you don't do anything to mess with the ext4 extents, such as defragmenting or balancing the filesystem, and you can't revert after deleting the subvolume of course).\n \nreply",
      "I believe you are right. You can only convert back to the metadata from before. So any new or changed (different extents) files will be lost or corrupted.So best to only mount ro when considering to rollback. Otherwise it's pretty risky.\n \nreply",
      "No, it also covers the data. As long as you don't delete the rollback subvolume, all the original data should still be there, uncorrupted.Even if you disable copy-on-write, as long as the rollback subvolume is there to lay claim to the old data, it's considered immutable and any modification will still have to copy it.\n \nreply",

      "From another article:\"Both the fetch+decode and op cache pipelines can be active at the same time, and both feed into the in-order micro-op queue. Zen 4 could use its micro-op queue as a loop buffer, but Zen 5 does not. I asked why the loop buffer was gone in Zen 5 in side conversations. They quickly pointed out that the loop buffer wasn\u2019t deleted. Rather, Zen 5\u2019s frontend was a new design and the loop buffer never got added back. As to why, they said the loop buffer was primarily a power optimization. It could help IPC in some cases, but the primary goal was to let Zen 4 shut off much of the frontend in small loops. Adding any feature has an engineering cost, which has to be balanced against potential benefits. Just as with having dual decode clusters service a single thread, whether the loop buffer was worth engineer time was apparently \u201cno\u201d.\"\n \nreply",

      "The Article more-or-less speculates that:> Zen 4 is AMD's first attempt at putting a loop buffer into a high performance CPU. Validation is always difficult, especially when implementing a feature for the first time. It's not crazy to imagine that AMD internally discovered a bug that no one else hit, and decided to turn off the loop buffer out of an abundance of caution. I can't think of any other reason AMD would mess with Zen 4's frontend this far into the core's lifecycle.\n \nreply",

Depending on the consequences of the bug and the conditions under which it hits, maybe you could even write an exploit (either going from JavaScript to the browser or from user mode to the kernel) with it :) Though, I strongly suspect that reverse engineering and weaponizing the bug without any insider knowledge will be exceedingly difficult.

If you make say a Brazil Government-only Windows which trusts this CA instead, I guarantee somebody crucial in Brazil will buy a 3rd party Windows laptop independently and it doesn't work with this CA's certificates and that ends up as Microsoft's problem to fix, so, easier to just have every Windows device trust the CA.They'll have an assurance from the CA that it won't do this sort of crap, and that's enough, plausible deniability.

      "Tools like Copilot and GPT-based copilots promise to reduce the repetitive burden of data engineering tasks, suggest code, and even debug complex pipelines. But how do we measure whether they\u2019re actually good at this? Frankly, the industry is lagging behind when it comes to evaluation methods. While SWE-bench offers a framework for software engineering, data engineering is just left out\u2014no tailored benchmarks, no precise way to gauge their effectiveness. It\u2019s time to change that.Why SWE-Bench Falls Short\nSWE-bench evaluates LLMs on real-world software engineering tasks by using GitHub issue\u2013pull request pairs from popular repositories.Success is measured by the quality, reliability, and scalability of data workflows, not just correctness of code.Data engineers solve complex systems-level problems involving constant data motion, quality maintenance, and continuous evolution. Treating these disciplines as equivalent is doing data engineering a disservice.DE deals with raw, messy, and large-scale data that must be cleaned, transformed, and made accessible.i.e. handling data quality, schema evolution, and compliance, not just code correctness.DE focuses on automating and orchestrating multi-step workflows, which requires understanding task dependencies, scheduling, and retries.Edge-cases! DE must handle schema drift, missing values, malformed records, and outliers, which are rarely part of SWE workflows.DE is less about writing application logic and more about making data usable, accessible, and reliable. Data engineers don\u2019t just write code. They manage workflows that operate across multiple systems, handle changing requirements, and scale with data growth. A DE benchmark needs to reflect these realities.One might argue that text-to-SQL benchmarks are a step toward evaluating LLMs for data engineering tasks. While useful, text-to-SQL falls far short of the needs of DE benchmarks for several reasons:Text-to-SQL only handles querying structured data. Data engineering is so much more: it involves transforming, orchestrating, and making sense of chaotic, mixed-format data.Lack of Pipeline Context. DE isn\u2019t more than single queries. it\u2019s about creating end-to-end workflows that deliver business value.Handling real-world problems like schema drift or malformed recordsData engineers work with Spark, Airflow, dbt\u2014not just databases. Generating a SQL query is child\u2019s play compared to orchestrating a complex Spark job across petabytes of data.Reliability, scalability, and optimization are make-or-break factors for DE. These are entirely missed by simple SQL benchmarks.In short, text-to-SQL is just one piece of the DE puzzle. Evaluating DE copilots requires a broader, pipeline-focused benchmark.A DE-bench would simulate real-world DE workflows, evaluating LLMs on their ability to solve practical, pipeline-oriented problems. Here\u2019s how it might look:Dataset Sources:Use public datasets (e.g., NYC Taxi data, Kaggle datasets).Generate synthetic data to simulate edge cases (e.g., missing values, schema drift).Data Ingestion: Load raw data from APIs or files into a database or data lake.Data Transformation: Normalize data formats, remove duplicates, and compute aggregates.Pipeline Orchestration: Create an Airflow DAG for a multi-step ETL pipeline.Schema Management: Migrate data between schemas safely.A DE-bench would provide a structured, objective framework for assessing LLMs on real-world DE tasks, ensuring that these tools are reliable, efficient, and robust. It\u2019s time we hold DE copilots to the same high standards as their SWE counterparts.\n \nreply",
      "AI can do some amazing things inferring from past behavior, but it certainly is a fair distance away from anything approaching understanding what the end goal is or what all the constraints are or might be in the future. Sure, people can set up some boilerplate problems and get custom boilerplate solutions but I really see AI as another level of tooling/abstraction that will only empower engineers to work less on the easy stuff and spend more time at a higher level of concern.In other words, I think the near term gain is that we will actually ACTUALLY not have to worry about centering a div anymore.\n \nreply"

      "Thank you for posting this guide, although I've stopped playing WoW, I would have loved to immortalize my druid with a 3D figurine.  I think there was a service for this a long time ago but I think the cost for the size was the reason why I didn't buy it.  Do you have any advice on how to paint a figurine?  For some reason Warhammer 40k has been popping up on my YouTube feed and I've been watching a lot of Warhammer figurine videos.  It seems like you need a lot of specialized brushes and skill to make it look nice.\n \nreply",
      "Don't overthink painting figures too much- it's the type of hobby where you start off with a few paints and some cheap brushes, then go through a journeyman phase of tons of specialized paints, brushes, tools, etc, then run into a real master who uses a few paints and some cheap brushes.Basically, just start by trying to get color onto the right part of the figure, then watch some videos on how to use shades and highlights to add depth and texture.  Play with the different techniques, buy some specific brushes or tools to make those techniques easier or more consistent, ditch the techniques that don't seem to work for you.Look for 'Sonic Sledgehammer' on youtube for a good way to start, at least for Warhammer sized figures.  His focus is for people who need to paint a bunch of figures in something of a hurry, but that means you can get a decent looking individual figure in an evening, which is encouraging.  He'll usually call out optional extra steps to add more depth or detail, which gives you a good idea of how more advanced techniques work when you're ready.\n \nreply",

If the engine does skinning in the vertex shader then you'd need to capture the output of that to easily get the actual pose, but perspective is applied at the same time, and you'd need to do some digging to find the matrix to undo that.

      "Either I haven\u2019t seen this before, or forgot it, but it\u2019s surprising because I use the sum of independent uniform variables every once in a while \u2014 the sum of two vars is a tent function, the sum of three is a smooth piecewise quadratic lump, and the sum of many tends toward a normal distribution. And the distribution is easy calculated as the convolution of the input box functions (uniform variables). Looking it up just now I learned the sum of uniform variables is called an Irwin-Hall distribution (aka uniform sum distribution).The min of two random vars has the opposite effect as the max does in this video. And now I\u2019m curious - if we use the function definition of min/max \u2014 the nth root of the sum of the nth powers of the arguments \u2014 there is a continuum from min to sum to max, right?

I\u2019m not sure but I might guess that for the special case of a set of independent uniform variables, the median and the mean distributions are the same?

Maybe Order Statistics are more applicable & useful than what I imagined\u2026\n \nreply",

For the median to be small two need to be small, but the mean needs three.I think order statistics are more useful than what you described, because \u201cmin\u201d and \u201cmax\u201d are themselves quantiles and more conceptually similar to \u201cmedian\u201d than to \u201cmean\u201d.Trying to imagine how to bridge from min/max to mean, I guess you could take weighted averages with weights determined by order, but I can\u2019t think of a canonical way to do that.\n \nreply",

      "My main concern with application-defined schemas is that this schema is validated by the wrong system. The database is the authority on what the schema is; all other layers in your application make assumptions based on effectively hearsay.The closest we came so far to bridging this gap in strictly typed language like Rust is SQLx, which creates a struct based on the database types returned by a query. This is validated at compile time  against a database, which is good, but of course there is no guarantee that the production database will have the same types. Easiest mistake to make is to design a query against your local Postgres v15 and hit a runtime error in production running Postgres v12, e.g. a function like gen_ramdom_uuid() doesn't exist. Another is to assume a migration in production was actually executed.In duck-typed languages like Ruby, the application objects are directly created from the database at runtime. They are as accurate as possible, since the schema is directly read at application startup. Then of course you see developers do something like:    if respond_to?(:column_x)\n        # do something with column_x\n    end\n\nTo summarize, I think application-defined schemas provide a false sense of security and add another layer of work for the engineer.\n \nreply",

For example using the wrong header for a C library, or the wrong Protobuf schema.I guess it would be good if it verified it at runtime somehow though.

Obviously I can't deploy new code to all 10 servers simultaneously that will do the schema migration; only one server can run the migration.  So one server runs the migration, and... what, the other 9 servers immediately panic because their idea of the schema is out of date?Or I deploy code to all 10 servers but somehow designate that only one of them will actually do the schema migration.  Well, now the other 9 servers are expecting the new schema, and will panic before that 1 server can finish doing the migration.It seems to me that rust-query is only suitable for applications where you have to schedule downtime in order to do schema changes.

      "I've called this ritual-taboo programming for decades. It happens for user interfaces and APIs when the documentation is absent, or only consists of examples. If there's no reference documentation, everything is a copy of something someone else did. Nobody understands how it really works.Now, for some interfaces, this isn't too bad. Most people don't know why US AC power plugs are polarized, or what the ground prong is for. Electricians have to, but users do not.For more complex interfaces, it means that many functions will either be misused or undiscovered. This is the source of the plaint that only 10%-20% of a product's features are used.On user interface design, the classic is \"Tog on Interface\", Bruce \"Tog\" Tognazzini, 1992.\nThat's from the Mac UI era. A more modern take is \"The Gamer's Brain\", by Celia Hodent, designer of Fortnite's UX.Software internal documentation seems to suffer today from a mindset that comments are unnecessary and waste space. Especially in the Javascript era. It's worst in languages that don't have data declarations. There's no place to properly document the data.Rust has good conventions and tools for documenting data. There's a well defined place where the documentation for each structure and field goes, and reasonable tools for checking it and turning that into documentation. If you fail to do this, when you publish your crate on crates.io, the documentation pages will come up blank, which screams \"loser\".Rust is weak on function parameter documentation. There should have been a defined place where each formal parameter gets a comment, which then appears in the documentation of the call.Most other languages don't take such a hard line. More should.\n \nreply",

The former sometimes straight up has things like \u201cso one guy tried this and it worked for him so we recommend you try it and see how it works for you\u201d. The latter has like 4 examples with no explanation of what you are looking at or how to make anything else work.

I can tell, because of all the questions that I get, that are in the docs.That's totally my fault.

      "What a fun time that was in the aughts for distros. Hardware was rapidly changing and made a lot of new stuff possible. I wonder if there are still emerging hardware platforms to inspire kids today. I had the most fun when I could combine software with hardware, like trying to fit a distro on a floppy, or using the business card CDs to boot a distro into RAM, creating thin terminal clients, routers, firewalls. Feels more real when there's something physical involved.Also worth noting that the concept Robert discusses of avoiding \"system rot\" is an early example of immutable infrastructure, a game-changing design used to automate fixing state and entropy failures in modern systems. Had no idea that's where it would lead.\n \nreply",

      "> Familial Natural Short Sleep (FNSS), a benign mutation that allows them to sleep 1-2 hours less than the recommended 7-9 hours, without experiencing the negative effects of sleep deprivation.Sleep deprivation is one concern, but there\u2019s a more subtle impact on cognitive functions (working memory, creativity, deep focus), overall health (particularly the endocrine and immune systems), and long-term health outcomes (such as an increased risk of dementia).When I was younger, I was fascinated by various optimized sleep schedules. However, I noticed a stark contrast: many of my math friends consistently slept 9\u201310 hours a day. They needed that\u2014not just to function in daily life but to achieve the deep focus required for their work. Living on less sleep might not affect immediate action (and in some cases, it might even seem to enhance focus on doing), but it can impair deeper, more complex thinking.Some suggest that one of sleep's key roles is to help the brain regenerate. Chronic sleep deprivation, in turn, is linked to a higher risk of dementia. For anecdotal evidence: Churchill and Thatcher, known for boasting about sleeping only 4\u20135 hours a night, experienced significant cognitive decline later in life.\n \nreply",
      "> When I was younger, I was fascinated by various optimized sleep schedules.I was also fascinated with alternate sleep schedules when I was younger. Some of the books and biohackers of the time made them sound like magical ways to get more hours out of the day.Then every single experience report I found that was not coming from someone trying to sell me a book or get me to subscribe to their newsletter, YouTube, or other social media was extremely negative. Nobody who tried these had continued them very long. After going back to regular sleep schedules they felt significantly better. A common report was that they didn\u2019t realize how badly sleep deprived they were until they stopped the alternate sleep schedule and went back to normal sleep.A lot of the sleep biohacking reports follow a similar trend: People who try alternate methods of minimizing sleep don\u2019t realize the negative effects until they quit.

Contrary to symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation, people with FNSS are \u201chealthy, energetic, optimistic, with high pain threshold, and do not seem to suffer adverse effects of chronic restricted sleep\u201d [2].
