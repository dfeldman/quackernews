      "The grid is HUGELY expensive, an absolutely massive cost for our electricity. And it would still be  expensive in a well-regulated environment where you can quickly and easily get permission to build, without, say, voter ballot propositions illegally blocking a transmission line for years [1]. Here in the US we have a very very poorly regulated environment for adding to our grid, it moves slower than molasses and there are so many parties that have unilateral veto points. The advent of a new transmission route in the US these days is pretty much a miracle event.Now imagine a world where there's tons of bribes to government officials all along the way to get a grid going (in the US you just need to bribe landowners and hold-outs). Or there's bribes to get a permit for the large centralized electriticy generator. And you have to deal with importing a whole new skill set and trades, on top of importing all the materials, fuel, etc.Decentralized solar plus batteries is already cheaper than electricity + transmission for me at my home in the US. The only thing stopping me is the permitting hassle or the contractor hassle.Out in greenfield, solar plus storage is so revolutionary. This is bigger than going straight to mobile phones instead of landlines.Africa is going to get so much power, and it's all going to be clean, renewable energy.

The manual says you can do:>`firefox --profile <path>   Start with profile at <path>`But that will not work as expected if you have more than one profile (which is the whole point). At present the only workable solution is to fiddle with a GUI thru `about:profiles` (or `firefox --ProfileManager`) in order to create the profiles and give them all-important UIDs. And then do:>`firefox -P <UID>`It may seem small, but I've found that this is a serious roadblock. I wish it could be fixed so as to make profiles entirely scriptable.PS: to be clear, after the futzing with the GUI to create the profiles, my script works (well!) at opening windows in the right profile, this way: (1) Check if the given profile is already launched: `ps -eo args | grep -E \".(firefox).(-P $UID)\" | grep -v grep > /dev/null` (2) Do `firefox -P $UID --new-instance $url` if it isn't, and `--new-tab` if it is.

      "Might be useful to ask a different question: What makes people happy?It's things like relationships, satisfying work, accomplishment. (and many, many more)Then the real question emerges: How many of those happiness 'sources' are made better by intelligence? What percentage?Relationships? Seems like no. Work? Also seems like no, lots of work doesn't make use of a high IQ that people enjoy nonetheless. Accomplishment? Strikes me as most likely of the three, but it's also very relative.And another thought,Asking why smart people aren't happier is a bit like asking why people who can jump high aren't more empathetic. There's no direct link between the two, you have to dip out to the material conditions.

Same thing, happiness is not directly correlated. Instead: Smart people are better able to create the outcomes they want > They select outcomes that make them happy > Their environment makes them happy > Smart people are happier.\n(These are illustrations of the idea, not actual logical chains or claims.)reply",
      "As I heard someone say, happiness is your reality minus your expectations.Smart people see more variables that could be changed, more components that could be modified, and are less likely to accept things as they are. This creates a false sense of ease by which reality could be modified, and thus higher expectations for the world around them.I suspect this misplaces happiness and contentment, but the two are also very strongly correlated for many people.reply",
      "I think smart people are told much more often as kids how bright of a future they have. So they build up expectations of \"succeeding\" in some sense (becoming a doctor, getting rich, etc.). These are the sort of expectations you mention in your quote.  Not only is there often pressure put on you if you're smart, you adopt those expectations yourself.  Or at least hold yourself to that standard. Of course, being smart doesn't automatically equal success, there are so many other factors.  So people often fall short of expectations and feel shitty about themselves and are unhappy.  Then there's also the fact that high achievers often hold themselves to unrealistic standards even if they \"succeed\", so they also struggle to be happy.reply",
      "For me this has 100% been the main source of unhappiness in my life. I wish nobody had ever told me how smart I was as a child. The reality was that I was above average but in an unremarkable collection of kids mostly. I\u2019ve done fine in life academically and career wise but I\u2019ll never live up to the expectations that were planted in my head.Thankfully you can get over this/yourself and let go of ego, ambition, achievement and all that unnecessary crap.reply",

Being ordinary and just eating breakfast and sleeping and doing a job is - in fact - extraordinarily rare.reply",
      "Isn\u2019t there a danger though of running into differences between oneself and others and concluding that the cause is oneself being \u201cweird\u201d and not the inherent difficulty of bridging the intelligence gap and correspondingly different ways of thinking? Like I could see a very bright kid ending up with low self esteem due to being different if they aren\u2019t told that the differences may be due to their intelligence. Like someone with average intelligence may have difficulty understanding and modeling someone with two or more standard deviations above average intelligence, and all social groups are definitionally numerically weighted towards the mean and away from the edges so absent some filtering the very bright kids will be unusual.reply",
      "Do you mean that there may be some harm in \"hiding\" from children their intelligence? I can see that maybe at early ages, but certainly they'll eventually catch on with grades and such? I don't know when different parts of personality manifest, maybe some child psychologist can chime in. But my hunch is that maybe not saying anything until grade 2-3 could potentially help. Above all, I think the key is to tell them that it's trying hard that leads to getting what you want. Obviously that's a bit of a lie, but I think acceptable until a later age.reply",

      "What this blog omits to mention and I think the most impressive part of Smalltalk ecosystem is the structure of the image - the application's state that you can freeze and distribute and resume elsewhere (makes supporting client side applications so much easier). The Smalltalk image is a very interesting beast. Look at it as a kind of immortality. Many current Smalltalk systems, Pharo, Squeak, VisualWorks among them, share a common ancestor, that is, a Smalltalk image from Xerox PARC. This common ancestor however is not some remote thing, but actually still alive in those modern systems. The modern variants were produced by sending messages to the objects in that image. Some of those messages actually morphed the current objects. Classes are full-blown objects, and creating new classes is done by sending messages to class objects. Some of the objects in a Smalltalk image may date back to 1972, when the first Smalltalk image bootstrapped! Smalltalk images never die, they just fade into something potentially fundamentally different. You should view your application building as not fundamentally different from creating a new Smalltalk version.reply",
      "The image concept, in my opinion, is what really limited Smalltalk's appeal and distribution.The image meant you basically got whatever state the developer ended up with, frozen in time, with no indication really of how they got there.Think of today's modern systems and open source, with so many libraries easily downloadable and able to be incorporated in your system in a very reproducible way. Smalltalk folks derided this as a low tech, lowest-common-denominator approach. But in fact it gave us reusable components from disparate vendors and sources.The image concept was a huge strength of Smalltalk but, really in the end in my opinion, one of the major areas that held it back.Java in particular surged right past Smalltalk despite many shortcomings compared to it, partially because of this. The other part of course was being free at many levels. The other half of Smalltalk issues beyond the image one, was the cost of both developer licenses ($$$$!) and runtime licenses (ugh!).reply",
      "> The image meant you basically got whatever state the developer ended up with, frozen in time, with no indication really of how they got there.That wasn't a function of the image system. That was a product of your version control/CI/CD systems and your familiarity with them.Consider that Docker and other container based systems also deploy images. No reason Smalltalk has to be any different.I did software development work in Smalltalk in the 90's. We used version control (at one point, we used PVCS, which was horrible, but Envy was pretty sweet), had a build process and build servers that would build deploy images from vanilla images. Even without all that, the Smalltalk system kept a full change log of ever single operation it performed in order. In theory, someone could wipe their changelog, but that's the moral equivalent of deleting the source code for your binary. Image-based systems are no reason to abandon good engineering practices.reply",
      "> Consider that Docker and other container based systems also deploy images.Consider also that Docker was the only one to really get popular, perhaps because it promoted the idea of using a text-based \"Dockerfile\" as your source of truth and treating the images as transitory built artifacts (however false this was in practice).reply",
      "I agree that the image concept was a problem, but I think that you're focused on the wrong detail.The problem with an image based ecosystem that I see is that you are inevitably pushed towards using tools that live within that image. Now granted, those tools are able to be very powerful because they leverage and interact with the image itself. But the community contributing to that ecosystem is far smaller than the communities contributing to filesystem based tools.The result is that people who are considering coming into the system, have to start with abandoning their familiar toolchain. And for all of the technical advantages of the new toolchain, the much smaller contributor base creates a worse is better situation. While the file-based system has fundamental technical limitations, the size of the ecosystem results in faster overall development, and eventually a superior system.reply",
      "> But the community contributing to that ecosystem is far smaller than the communities contributing to filesystem based tools.Another point is that you need to export your tools out of your own image so others can import it into their images. This impedance mismatch between image and filesystem was annoying.reply",
      "I think we could quibble over the relative importance of these points, but I agree in general. The image locking you into that ecosystem is definitely a good point.reply",
      "> The image meant you basically got whatever state the developer ended up with, frozen in time, with no indication really of how they got there.I worked with a similar language, Actor (Smalltalk with an Algol-like syntax), and the usual way to deal with distribution was to \u201cpack\u201d (IIRC) the image by pointing to the class that your app is an instance of, and the tool would remove every other object that is not a requirement of your app. With that you got an image that started directly into your app, without any trace of the development environment.reply",
      "Agreed with that; this is why I think it should unite both the \"scripting\" as well as image approach, at the same time.reply",
      ">> most impressive part of Smalltalk ecosystem is the structure of the image> The image concept, in my opinion, is what really limited Smalltalk's appeal and distribution.I'd say these statements are both true.  The image concept is very impressive and can be very useful, it certainly achieved a lot of bang for very little buck.And it also was/is one of the major impediments for Smalltalk, at least after the mid 1980s.The impressive bit is shown by pretty much the entire industry slowly and painfully recreating the Smalltalk image, just usually worse.For example on macOS a lot of applications nowadays auto-save their state and will completely return to the state they were last in.  So much that nowadays if you have a lot of TextEdit windows open and wish to make sure everything is safe, you kill the program, you don't quit it.Also, all/most of the shared libraries and frameworks that come with the system are not loaded individually, instead they are combined into one huge image file that is mapped into your process.  At some point they stopped shipping the individual framework and shared library binaries.User interfaces have also trended in the direction of a an application that contains its own little world, rather than editing files that exist within the wider Unix filesystem.The image accomplished all that and more and did so very efficiently.  Both in execution speed and in amount of mechanism required:  have a contiguous piece of memory.  Write to disk, make a note of the start pointer.  On load, map or read it into memory, fix up the pointers if you didn't manage to load at the same address and you're ready to go.  On G4/G5 era Macs, the latter would take maybe a second or two, whereas Pages, for example, took forever to load if things weren't already cached, despite having much less total data to load.But the drawbacks are also huge.  You're really in your little world and going outside of it is painful.  On an Alto in the mid to late 1970s I imagine that wasn't much of an issue, because there wasn't really much outside world to connect to, computer-wise, and where would you fit it on a 128KB machine (including the bitmap display)?   But nowadays the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.With Objective-S, I am building on top of Cocoa's Bundle concept, so special directories that can contain executable code, data or both.  Being directories, bundles can nest.  You can treat a bundle as data that your program (possibly the IDE) can edit.  But you can also plonk the same bundle in the Resources folder of an application to have it become part of that application.  In fact, the IDE contains an operation to just turn the current bundle into an application, by copying a generic wrapper application form its own resources and then placing the current bundle into that freshly created/copide app.Being directories, data resources in bundles can remain standard files, etc.With Objective-S being either interpreted or compiled, a bundle with executable code can just contain the source code, which the interpreter will load and execute.  Compiling the code inside a bundle to binaries is just an optimization step, the artifact is still a bundle.  Removing source code of a bundle that has an executable binary is just an obfuscation/minimization step, the bundle is still the bundle.reply"

The fuzzy graph of F(x, y) = 0 is simply a 3D plot of z = |F(x, y)|, where z is displayed using color. In other words, F(x, y) is a constraint and z shows us how strongly the constraint is violated. Then the graph given by F(x, y) = 0 is a slice of the 3D graph.

It's true that I've encountered things like visualizing error gradients (in the ML space) in a non-binary way. And yes, mapping 3D to color (and 3D graphing) is nothing novel.But, I think that the idea of visualizing equations using the question \"How different are both sides?\" instead of \"Are both sides EXACTLY equal - Yes or No?\" is a new way to think about it - I don't know of any other graphing app/calculator (besides https://fuzzygraph.com) that does it.I think some would say that the \"Fuzzy graph\" of an equation is not a true graph of that equation because a \"visualization transform\" is being applied, and that only the conventional/binary graph is a valid graph of the equation. But even conventional graphing apps must apply a \"visualization transformation\" to the equation - something like: 'black' if Boolean(left(x, y)==right(x, y)) else 'white.reply",

It may well be a new \"plot type\" to most people relying on standard plotting software to visualize equations.Maybe consider saying it's grounded in \"more advanced\" math than what others have brought to plotting software. That's still impressive, but it can be made pretty much true. You can cite cool math references about \"implicit function theorem\" or whatever.

      "XDP (eXpress Data Path) is the fastest packet processing framework in linux - but it only works for incoming (ingress) traffic. We discovered how to use it for outgoing (egress) traffic by exploiting a loophole in how the linux kernel determines packet direction. Our technique delivers 10x better performance than current solutions, works with existing Docker/Kubernetes containers, and requires zero kernel modifications.This post not only expands on the overall implementation but also outlines how existing container and VM workloads can immediately take advantage with minimal effort and zero infrastructure changes.reply",
      "Forgive me of my ignorance, but is XDP faster than DPDK for packet processing? It seems like DPDK has had a lot of work done for hardware optimizations that allow speeds that I can\u2019t recall XDP being able to do. I have not looked too deeply into this though, so I\u2019m very open to being wrong!reply",
      "DPDK is a framework with multiple backends, on the receive side it can use XDP to intercept packets.You can't compare the efficiency of the frameworks without talking about the specific setups on the host. The major advantage of XDP is that it is completely baked into the kernel. All you need to do is bring your eBPF program and attach it. DPDK requires a great deal of setup and user space libraries to work.reply",
      "DPDK will give you the absolute best performance, period. But it will do so with tradeoffs that are far from negligible, especially on mixed-workload machines like a docker host/k8s node/hypervisor.1. to get the absolute best performance, you're running in poll-mode, and burning cpu cores just for packet processing2. the network interface is invisible to the kernel, making non-accelerated traffic on said interface tricky (say, letting the kernel perform arp resolution for you).3. your dataplane is now a long-lived process, which means that stopping said process equates to no more network (hello restarts!)Alleviating most of those takes a lot of effort or some tradeoffs making it less worth it:1. can be mitigated by adaptive polling at the cost of latency.2. by using either a software bifurcation by re-injecting non-accelerated traffic in a tap, or with NICs with hardware bifurcation (e.g. connectx) and installing the flows in  its flow engine. Both are quite time consuming to get right3. by manually writing a handoff system between new and old processes, and making sure it never crashesDPDK also needs its own runtime, with its own libraries. Some stuff will be manual (e.g. giving it routing tables). XDP gives all of those for free:1. All modern NIC drivers will already perform adaptive polling and interrupt moderation; so you're not burning CPU cycles on polling the card outside of high packet rate scenarios (on which you'd burn CPUs on IRQs and context switches anyways).2. It's just an extra bit of software in the driver's path, and the XDP program decides whether to handle it itself or pass id down to the kernel. Pretty useful to keep ARP, ICMP, BGP, etc without extra code.3. XDP is closer to a lambda than anything: the code runs once for every single packet, meaning its runtime is extremely short. This also means that the long-running process is your kernel; and that updating the code is an atomic operation that done on the fly.4. A lot of facilities are already provided, and the biggest of them is maps. The kernel handles all the stateful things to feed data (routing tables, arp tables, etc) to your dataplane code. CPU affinity is also handled by the kernel in the sense that XDP runs on the CPU responsible for the NIC queue, whose mapping is controlled through standard kernel interfaces, unrelated to XDP (meaning: not on your mind).Now, speaking purely of optimizations. Yes, DPDK will always be better CPU-wise because you can compile it with -march native while eBPF is JIT-ed when available (and pretty poorly, having already looked at it). However, from experience, the parts that actually take time are map lookups (looking up the nexthop, looking up the mac address, etc), and those are written in C in the kernel, thus are as optimized as the kernel can be. Recompiling the kernel for your CPU can boost performance, but I've never done it myself.Today, I would consider that unless you absolutely need the absolute best performance, XDP is more than fine. Modern CPUs are so fast that it's not worth it to consider DPDK for most cases.- container routing like there? the dpdk runtime is a no-go, and the operational flexibility of xdp is a killer.- network appliances like switches/routers? shell out a few extra bucks and buy a slightly better CPU. if latency is paramount, or you're doing per-packet processing that cannot fit in an ebpf probe, then go the dpdk route.At a previous job, I rewrote for fun a simple internal dpdk routing application using xdp: only half the performance (in packets per second, not bits per second) on the same hardware with no optimizations whatsoever, in 100 lines or ebpf. Mind you, I could saturate a 100Gbps link with 100 bytes packets, not 64 bytes, what a tragedy /s. On more modern hardware (latest EPYC), I trivially reached 200Mpps on an 8 core CPU using XDP.Long story short, you'll know when you need DPDK.reply",
      "XDP, and the eBPF ecosystem in general, is quite neat. However, a word of caution:* The BPF verifier's DX is not great yet. If it finds problems with your BPF code it will spit our a rather inscrutable set of error messages that often requires a good understanding of the verifier internals (e.g the register nomenclature) to debug* For the same source code, the code generated by the verifier can change across compiler versions in a breaking way, e.g. because the new compiler version implemented an optimization that broke the verifier (see https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/4612)* Checksum updating requires extra care. I believe you can only do incremental updates, not just because of better perf as the post suggests but also because the verifier does not allow BPF programs to operate on unbounded buffers (so checksumming a whole packet of unknown size is tricky / cumbersome). This mostly works but you have to be careful with packets that were generated with csum offload, don't have a valid checksum and whose csum can't be incrementally updated.As the blog post points out, the kernel networking stack does a lot of work that we don't generally think about. Once you start taking things into your own hands you don't have the luxury of ignorance anymore (think not just ARP but also MTU, routing, RP filtering etc.), something any user of userspace networking frameworks like DPDK will tell you.My general recommendation is to stick with the kernel unless you have a very good justification for chasing better performance and if you do use eBPF save yourself some trouble and try to limit yourself to readonly operations, if your use case allows.Also, if you are trying to debug packet drops, newer kernels have started logging this information that you can track using bpftrace which gives you better diagnostics.Example script (might have to adjust based on kernel version):    bpftrace -e '\n        kprobe:kfree_skb_reason {\n        $skb = (struct sk_buff *)arg0;\n        $ipheader = ((struct iphdr *) ($skb->head + $skb->network_header));\n        printf(\"reason :%d %s -> %s\\n\", arg1, ntop($ipheader->saddr), ntop($ipheader->daddr));\n    }'reply",
      "We absolutely ran into these issues.A couple notes that help quite a bit:1. Always build the eBPF programs in a container - this is great for reproducibility of course, but also makes DevX on MacOS better for those who prefer to use that.2. You actually can do a full checksum! You need to limit the MTU but you can:  static __always_inline void tcp_checksum(const struct iphdr *ip_header, struct tcphdr *tcp_header, const __u16 tcp_len, const void *data_end) {\n    __u32 sum = 0;\n    __u16 *buf = (void *)tcp_header;\n    ip_header_pseudo_checksum(ip_header, tcp_len, &sum);\n    tcp_header->check = 0;\n    __u16 max_packet_size = tcp_len;\n    if (max_packet_size > MAX_TCP_PACKET_SIZE) {\n        max_packet_size = MAX_TCP_PACKET_SIZE;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < max_packet_size / 2; i++) {\n        if ((void *)(buf + 1) > data_end) {\n            break;\n        }\n        sum += *buf;\n        buf++;\n    }\n    if ((void *)buf + 1 <= data_end && ((__u8 *)buf - (__u8 *)tcp_header) < max_packet_size) {\n        sum += *(__u8 *)buf;\n    }\n    tcp_header->check = csum_fold_helper(sum);\n  }\n\nWith that being said, it's not lost on me that XDP in general is something you should only reach for once you hit some sort of bottleneck. The original version of our network migration was actually implemented in userspace for this exact reason!reply",
      "> You actually can do a full checksumIndeed! This is what I had in mind when I wrote \"cumbersome\" :).It's been a while for me to be able to recall whether the problem was the verifier or me, and things may have improved since, but I recall having the verifier choke on a static size limit too. Have you been able to use this trick successfully?> Always build the eBPF programs in a containerThat should work generally but watch out for any weirdness due to the fact that in a container you are already inside a couple of layers of networking (bridge, netns etc.).reply",

      "Hah! I had watched this just last night. I have a Fisher & Paykel Dishdrawer so this prompted me to check the instruction manual and sure enough, I had been putting Rinse Aid in the pre-wash area. I don't even really know what Rinse Aid is honestly but it's fun having some things be a black box. Turns out the correct spot is turning a knob, pulling it out and pouring it down a hole containing a glowing red light. I had assumed there was just some sort of circuitry down there and doing so would be a horrible idea. Thanks Technology Connections!reply",
      "It's a volatile surfactant. Thus, it allows water to drip off your dishes before drying, so you don't get spots, but also doesn't produce a residue of its own.reply",
      "I wouldn\u2019t use rinse aid. It\u2019s not good for you - damages your gut and may contain dioxane byproducts.  I also would avoid detergents with ethoxylated alcohols (AEs).What to look for is any powder or powder-filled pod with a) no AEs and b) does contain amylase and protease , two food-eating enzymes that are often omitted for who knows why.365 Whole Foods brand pods are my go-toreply",
      "[Several citations needed]reply",
      "The guy in the video disagrees with you. From his other video, 23 mins in,> next, rinse aids. use them. this isn't a scam.I'll trust the dishwasher expert until there's some proper citations.You have to realize that every time you sip a glass or eat off a surface that's provided by a commercial entity, you're getting items that have come in contact with industrial appliances that dispense rinse aid.I have a difficult time believing that something so ubiquitous is as harmful as you claim, but I'm open to being convinced.reply"

      "I like the idea, and we need variety in the market to keep things evolving, but I like the bells and whistles. I just don't want it to phone home. Honestly, I want the title to be 'we don't have a network connection and we can still be a car'. Privacy is my #1 feature.reply",
      "I own 3 EVs. Two of those, from 2012 and 2014, were built with 3G modems, and fully lost connectivity in 2022 when the 3G networks were turned down. Nothing changed, not even an error message inside the car, except that trying to connect to them with their apps now fails. They're still totally functional cars. The failure mode on both appears to have been \"guess I don't have service, I'll sleep the modem.\" Bluetooth still works, but even if that failed one of them has a functional CD player!My newer EV that came with LTE connectivity will also fully work without network connectivity, except for the apps and remote updates. You can turn off the built-in cell connectivity via the head unit menus, and if you're especially paranoid, you can pull the fuse on the modem (and I've done it!). When it doesn't have a network connection it too operates just like a normal car.There's a lot of fear around EVs being \"software on wheels\" based on a few manufacturers making non-remote features that depend on remote connectivity and botching updates or requiring subscriptions, and I agree that all is super problematic both from a privacy perspective and point-of-failure reason. But there's absolutely nothing intrinsic to the core design of EVs that demands that they're connected to the network.reply",
      "I have a BYD Seal and this was as simple as removing the SIM (it's in the armrest compartment and just pops out).reply",
      "On some cars you can also unplug whatever radio/modem doodad is responsible for phoning home. I have a Ford Maverick and disconnected the \"telemetry module\"  which resides under the transmission hump by the front passenger seat.I no longer receive updates to the infotainment system and I can't unlock the doors with my phone, but I also don't have the dealer emailing me service ads with my exact current mileage and tire pressure.reply",
      "This is how it should be if the user prefers not to be connected.reply",
      "I mean, even back in the OnStar days, you could \"opt out\" and cancel the service and it would track you anyway. With BYD or any other car maker, I'd be worried the SIM was a placebo.reply",
      "This is where things like a HackRF or flipper zero are useful - leave a scan running over 24 hours from multiple fixed locations within the vehicle and you can detect if there are any wireless transmissions, and then triangulate on exactly where they come from using several pieces of yarn cut to the length of estimated distance from the source.Cars should be independent, local only devices. Having cloud dependencies is just reckless and stupid.reply",
      "Can this be done without picking up the myriad of SIMs that pass near your car? How would you know which of them is your ghost SIM?reply",
      "You'd need to differentiate between sources - you'd want to capture every signal, then sort into buckets by frequency, by regular timing, and so forth - if a device is sending a burst every 5 seconds, then you can grab every 5 second occurrence of a signal at that frequency and make a reasonable assumption that all that data is from the same radio.You can filter for all the frequencies that show up regularly, then you differentiate by signal strength - group occurrences of the same frequency into similar dB buckets, then correlate the changes based on new fixed positions within the car, and run some calculations on changes in signal strength to obtain a dB to distance calculation. The strength to distance calculation can be estimated by making some assumptions about the type of radio you're looking for - a simple cellular module is going to be different than a WiFi repeater, or a wireless fob, or a bluetooth tracker.From the fixed points within your car, you can tie one end of a piece of yarn to where the sensor was affixed, and the length of the yarn should correlate to your dB to distance estimate for that position, and with 2-3 or even 4-5 threads you'd be able to group their loose ends together to get a rough physical indication of exactly where the radio transmission is coming from.The grouping won't be exact, but it'll literally point in the right direction, and if the threads are too long, or pointing to something buried in the chassis or whatnot, then you can reduce the lengths of your yarns by the same percentage of reduction and they'll be \"pointing\" at wherever the radio source is.You're going to get a general location, like \"under the dashboard\" or \"in the glovebox\" or \"somewhere under the spare in the trunk\", not a millimeter precise location. You could probably vibecode a way of processing the data in a browser, and use a bunch of splats and AI modeling of your car and so forth to get a very precise and useful pinpoint of a device with a fancy UI, but you can just use a spreadsheet and text files of logged signal records, the process isn't super difficult.reply",
      "Anyone know of reviewers that do this for cars? I just don't see privacy focused reviews on basically anything. We have reviews about how reparable things are and how good/bad the features are but rarely do I see privacy mentioned or in-depth analysis of TOS and the like to give buyers a sense of how good/bad cars and other devices are. Does everyone just assume it is terrible and go on or is there some reason this isn't a top level item for journalists to evaluate?reply"
