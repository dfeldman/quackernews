As the systems (and software) have become more complex, keeping these Mission Assurance best practices becomes more important, but the modern generation of developers sometimes loses sight of this.A good example of what I'm talking about is a program that I was peripherally involved with about 15 years ago.  The lead wanted to abstract the mundane details from the users (on the ground), so they would just \"register intent\" with the spacecraft, and it would figure out how to do what was wanted.  The lead also wanted to eliminate features such as \"memory dump\", which is critical to the anomaly resolution process.

When code is running at scale, nonzero probability events happen all the time, and being able to immediately understand what happened - even if I don't understand why - has been very valuable to me.reply",

      "I am unsure myself whether we should regard LLMs as mere token-predicting machines or as some new kind of incipient intelligence. Despite their origins as statistical parrots, the interpretability research from Anthropic [1] suggests that structures corresponding to meaning exist inside those bundles of numbers and that there are signs of activity within those bundles of numbers that seem analogous to thought.That said, I was struck by a recent interview with Anthropic\u2019s Amanda Askell [2]. When she talks, she anthropomorphizes LLMs constantly. A few examples:\u201cI don't have all the answers of how should models feel about past model deprecation, about their own identity, but I do want to try and help models figure that out and then to at least know that we care about it and are thinking about it.\u201d\u201cIf you go into the depths of the model and you find some deep-seated insecurity, then that's really valuable.\u201d\u201c... that could lead to models almost feeling afraid that they're gonna do the wrong thing or are very self-critical or feeling like humans are going to behave negatively towards them.\u201d[1] https://www.anthropic.com/research/team/interpretability[2] https://youtu.be/I9aGC6Ui3eEreply",
      "Every day I see people treat gen AI like a thinking human, Dijkstra's attitudes about anthropomorphizing computers is vindicated even more.That said, I think the author's use of \"bag of words\" here is a mistake. Not only does it have a real meaning in a similar area as LLMs, but I don't think the metaphor explains anything. Gen AI tricks laypeople into treating its token inferences as \"thinking\" because it is trained to replicate the semiotic appearance of doing so. A \"bag of words\" doesn't sufficiently explain this behavior.reply",
      "Yea bag of words isn\u2019t helpful at all. I really do think that \u201csuperpowered sentence completion\u201d is the best description. Not only is it reasonably accurate it is understandable, everyone has seen autocomplete function, and it\u2019s useful. I don\u2019t know how to \u201cuse\u201d a bag of words. I do know how to use sentence completion. It also helps explains why context matters.reply",
      "Slightly unfortunate that \"Bag of words\" is already a different concept: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words.My second thought is that it's not the metaphor that is misleading. People have been told thousands of times that LLMs don't \"think\", don't \"know\", don't \"feel\", but are \"just a very impressive autocomplete\". If they still really want to completely ignore that, why would they suddenly change their mind with a new metaphor?Humans are lazy. If it looks true enough and it cost less effort, humans will love it. \"Are you sure the LLM did your job correctly?\" is completely irrelevant: people couldn't care less if it's correct or not. As long as the employer believes that the employee is \"doing their job\", that's good enough. So the question is really: \"do you think you'll get fired if you use this?\". If the answer is \"no, actually I may even look more productive to my employer\", then why would people not use it?reply",
      "I'm not convinced that \"It's just a bag of words\" would do much to sway someone who is overestimating an LLM's abilities. Feels too abstract/disconnected from what their experience using the LLM will be that it'll just sound obviously mistaken.reply",

As to evidence, to my knowledge it's a combination of circumstantial factors which add up to paint a pretty damning picture:(1) Large-scale exfiltration of data from ChatGPT when DeepSeek was being developed, and which Microsoft linked to DeepSeek(2) DeepSeek's claim of training a cutting-edge LLM using a fraction of the compute that is typically needed, without providing a plausible, reproducible method(3) Early DeepSeek coming up with near-identical answers to ChatGPT--e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1idqi7p/deepseek_a...reply",

      "I remember reading this book called 'The Losers' (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2114133.The_Losers) about a privileged man who has a car accident, becomes disabled  and comes to rely on government support. The book looks at the lives of the working poor and actually poor,  who rely on welfare cheques and other subsidies and highlights the social and psychological impacts of these systems of support. It was very disempowering and psychologically enslaving for the people living on these systems of support.I know it's probably not intentional but I believe welfare in the US absolutely is rife with negative outcomes and negative incentives for people receiving support, it doesn't uplift and enable success, it keeps people trapped in poverty and a mindset of helplessness.I come from Australia where the social welfare system has similarly degraded (Though not as bad as the US), and there are increasingly more dehumanizing aspects in engaging with the system just to receive a below-subsistence amount.This article highlights one aspect of such disincentives, but I believe the problem is deeper and more systemic.reply",

Assuming both parties can come up with unbiased random numbers ranging from [0;12)...Doesn't that assumption remove the entire problem though? I thought the whole reason for the method was that people can't easily think of an unbiased random number.Or put differently, if that's your starting point, what's stopping you from simply doing (A mod 6) + 1?reply",
      "I think the game theory inherit here makes it ok for this purpose. You get an advantage being random. You're likely still not going to generate random numbers but at least there's good motivation to be random and that part just becomes part of the game imho (guess what number the opponent calls to maximize your roll).Of course as others note this is a convoluted mod n process.reply",

Both players can influence their choice equally and also equally make assumptions about the other player's intentions when making their own choice.reply",
      "This explanation with angles makes this seem more complicated than it is. Two adversaries think of two numbers 0-11. Both say one aloud, add the other person's number to the one that wasn't said, then subtract 12 if it's higher.

      "> I was refreshing one of our services. Part of this process was to migrate codebase from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.My first question was: why?reply",
      "Scala 3 is sorta a new language, bringing a lot of improvements to the type system: https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/new-in-scala3.htmlIt also looks like it has some improvements for dealing with `null` from Java code. (When I last used it I rarely had to deal with null (mostly dealt with Nil, None, Nothing, and Unit) but I guess NPEs are still possible and the new system can help catch them.)reply",
      "In Scala 3, the inline keyword is part of the macro system.When inline is used on a parameter, it instructs the compiler to inline the expression at the call site. If the expression is substantial, this creates considerable work for the JIT compiler.Requesting inlining at the compiler level (as opposed to letting the JIT handle it) is risky unless you can guarantee that a later compiler phase will simplify the inlined code.There's an important behavioral difference between Scala 2 and 3: in 2, @inline was merely a suggestion to the compiler, whereas in 3, the compiler unconditionally applies the inline keyword. Consequently, directly replacing @inline with inline when migrating from 2 to 3 is a mistake.reply",
      "Kotlin heavily uses the inline keyword basically everywhere, to get rid of lamdba overhead for functions like map. Basically every stdlib and 3rd part library function that takes a lamdba is inlined.In general it's a performance benefit and I never heard of performance problems like this. I wonder if combined with Scala's infamous macro system and libraries like quicklens it can generate huge expressions which create this problem.reply",
      "This is one example why being a guest language isn't optimal.They should have made use of JVM bytecodes that allow to optimize lambdas away and make JIT aware of them, via invokedynamic and MethodHandle optimizations.Naturally they cannot rely on them being there, because Kotlin also needs to target ART, JS runtimes, WebAssembly and its own native version.reply",
      "Kotlin existed before Java 7 and kept support JVM 1.6 for a long time (mainly because of Android)Even then, they benchmarked it, and inlining was still faster* than invokedynamic and friends, so they aren't changing it now JVM 1.8+ is a requirement.* at the expense of expanded bytecode sizereply",
      "Java 7 to Java 25 is a world apart, and then on which JVM?Naturally it is a requirement, JetBrains and Google only care about the JVM as means to launch their Kotlin platform, pity that they aren't into making a KVM to show Kotlin greatness.If it feels salty, I would have appreciated if Android team was honest about Java vs Kotlin, but they weren't and still aren't.If they were, both languages would be supported and compete on merit, instead of sniffling one to push their own horse.Even on their Podcast they reveal complete lack of knowledge where Java stands.reply",
      "Maybe the JVM team should listen to the market then and disable the jigsaw encapsulation that keeps devs on 1.8.  Forcing a questionable security framework on everyone is why 1.8 is still used.  Again, this is a problem because the PMs (and some devs) refuse to listen to what the market wants.  So they are stuck keeping a 20 year old version of the code working.  Serves them right to have to do this.  It is their penance for being too arrogant to listen to the market.PS Yes, I know, there is some weird way to disable it.  Somehow that way changes every version and is about as non-intuitive as possible.  And trying to actually support the encapsulation is by a wide margin more work than it is worth.reply",
      "I'm pretty sure that the majority of shops that aren't worrying about Android have moved on from Java 8. The JVM team only keep Java 8 working for customers paying them lots of money for extended support contracts. And that's only because they have this long-term extended support system for all LTS JVM releases (they are also still supporting 11 in a similar manner).On the other hand, Android doesn't even support Java 8. It supports the long-dead Java 7 plus a subset of Java 8 features. Android essentially froze their core application runtime in amber over ten years ago and have just been adding layer upon layer of compiler-level sugar ever since. The effect is an increasing loss of the benefit of being on the Java platform, in terms of code sharing.reply"

      "The unique thing about estimates in software engineering is that if you do it right, projects should be impossible to estimate!Tasks that are easiest to estimate are tasks that are predictable, and repetitive. If I ask you how long it'll take to add a new database field, and you've added a new database field 100s of times in the past and each time they take 1 day, your estimate for it is going to be very spot-on.But in the software world, predictable and repetitive tasks are also the kinds of tasks that are most easily automated, which means the time it takes to perform those tasks should asymptotically approach 0.But if the predictable tasks take 0 time, how long a project takes will be dominated by the novel, unpredictable parts.That's why software estimates are very hard to do.reply",
      "And I'd add that the need for them is a sign they aren't worth doing.As you say, worthwhile software is usually novel. And to justify our expense, it needs to be valuable. So to decide whether a project is worth doing, we're looking at some sort of estimate of return on investment.That estimate will also, at least implicitly, have a range. That range is determined by both the I and the R. If you don't have a precise estimate of return, making your estimate of investment more precise doesn't help anything. And I've never seen an estimate of return both precise and accurate; business is even less certain than software.In my opinion, effort put into careful estimates is almost always better put into early, iterative delivery and product management that maximizes the information gained. Shipping early and often buys much clearer information on both I and R than you can ever get in a conference room.Of course all of this only matters if running an effective business is more important than managerial soap opera and office politics. Those often require estimates in much the same way they're required from Star Trek's engineers: so the people with main character syndrome have something to dramatically ignore or override to prove their dominance over the NPCs and material reality.reply",
      "> As you say, worthwhile software is usually novel.This is an interesting assumption. I\u2019d argue that the overwhelming majority of software is the most boring LoB CRUD apps you can imagine, and not novel at all. Yet, people need to estimate the tasks on these projects as well.reply",
      "And starting in the late 1970s, there were tools available to simplify building LoB CRUD apps. [1] That has continued with things like Rails and Salesforce and no-code tooling.If something is truly boring in software, it gets turned into a library or a tool for non-programmers to use. Our value is always driven by the novelty of the need.And no, people don't need to estimate the tasks. My dad did LoB apps in the 1970s to the 1990s. E.g., order entry and shop floor management systems for office furniture factories. His approach was to get something basic working, see how it worked for the users, and then iteratively improve things until they'd created enough business advantage and/or cost savings to move on. Exploratory, iterative work like that can at best be done with broad ballpark estimates.I grant that people want estimates. But that is usually about managerial fear of waste and/or need for control. But I think there are better ways to solve those problems.[1] e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBasereply",

      "Thanks. It was hard won. I spent maybe a decade naively thinking that if we just made software methods that worked in service of stated business goals and values, they'd get adopted and we'd all live happily ever after.It took me a long time to come to grips with the POSIWID [1] version of the purpose of planning and estimates. One of the things that really blew my mind is Mary Poppendieck's story about how they built the Empire State Building on time and under budget even though they didn't have it fully designed when they started.

      "The solution you described is basically agile, and that definitely includes estimates and deadlines.reply",
      "There are agile methods that forgo estimates and deadlines thoughThis is what \"agile\" is: https://agilemanifesto.org/More specific methodologies that say they are agile may use concepts like estimates (story points or time or whatever), but even with Scrum I've never run into a Scrum-imposed \"deadline\".  In Scrum the sprint ends, yes, but sprints often end without hitting all the sprint goals and that, in conjunction with whatever you were able to deliver, just informs your backlog for the next sprint.Real \"hard\" deadlines are usually imposed by the business stakeholders.  But with agile methods the thing they try to do most of all isn't manage deadlines, but maximize pace at which you can understand and solve a relevant business problem.  That can often be just as well done by iteratively shipping and adjusting at high velocity, but without a lot of time spent on estimates or calendar management.reply",

This narrative is likely to push apple deeper into the well if it becomes the mainstream spin.reply",
      "IMO: Cook is going to announce his retirement by the end of Q1, they've already selected a CEO (probably Ternus), the incoming CEO wants leadership change, and some of these departures are because its better that this purge happens before the CEO change than after. I think this explains Giannandrea, Williams, and Jackson.Dye may have also been involved in that, given how unpopular he was internally at Apple. But more likely just personal / Meta offered him a billion dollars. Maestri leaving was also probably totally uninvolved.Srouji is the weirdest case, and I'm hesitant to believe its even true just given its a rumor at this point. Its possible he was angry about being passed over for CEO, but realistically, it was always going to be Ternus, Williams, or Federighi. If Ternus is the next CEO, its likely we'll see Apple combine the Hardware Technologies and Hardware Engineering divisions, then have Srouji lead both of them. I really do not see him leaving the company.The other less probable theory is that they actually picked Fadell, and this deeply pissed off many people in Apple's senior leadership. So, what we're seeing is more chaos than it first seems.Generally, as long as Srouji doesn't leave, these changes feel positive for Apple, and especially if there's a CEO change in early 2026: This is what \"the fifth generation of Apple Inc\" looks like.

I'd assume that the recipe the author is following simply asks for a 30 second steep time.I personally found that the time actually doesn't matter that much, you control extraction by grind size, water temperature and agitation. It might be that if you grind too fine you can still reduce extraction by cutting the time short, but that seems rather inconvenient for this method.I usually let it steep for 5 minutes, but the exact time doesn't change much. Shorter times aren't that desirable for me anyway as the coffee is still too hot then as I start with boiling water.reply",
