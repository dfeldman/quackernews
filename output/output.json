      "On the one hand Hawley proposes a lot of things that don't ever get close to becoming law.On the other hand, we did ban TikTok (which is currently unavailable on the app stores because of the ban).I can think of few ways to more effectively destroy any US advantage in AI compared with the sheer efficiency of making it illegal to learn from what competing countries have achieved. From the article, it sounds like the proposed legislation is deeply confused about what \"downloading DeepSeek\" means--they're _talking_ about banning the app, while _writing_ laws to ban \"the importation into the United States of artificial intelligence or generative artificial intelligence technology or intellectual proprietary developed or produced in the People\u2019s Republic of China\" which is a lot broader. Is it proposing to ban US citizens from reading research papers written by Chinese citizens? Or from publishing research in places that might be read by them? Apparently the EFF is concerned that the language of the bill is, indeed, that broad.\n \nreply",
      "Not sure it\u2019s even worth speculating on a bill that\u2019s merely been proposed. This one sounds DOA. But yeah TikTok ban was a very bad precedent, mostly because it was based on speculative risks, not hard proof of existing behaviour (TikTok not engaging didn't help at all either). Regardless of the merits I too hope it doesn\u2019t have a ripple effect. National security is such a huge brush you could paint anything you want.\n \nreply",
      "The risk from TikTok is possibly not speculative at all. I think it\u2019s quite likely the national security apparatus knows something and informed congressmen because they went from being opposed to it to being in favor of it in a short time.\n \nreply",
      "While there may very well be security concerns, other countries have handled this by simply banning the app on government devices (eg: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tiktok-banned-on-uk-gover...). You needn't ban the app nationwide to address those concerns. What I believe is more likely is that, this isn't about national security or data privacy, which could be addressed far more effectively with subject-appropriate legislation (such as data privacy laws akin to GDPR), but rather that TikTok was banned over unfavourable speech. It is no secret that TikTok has been used as a platform of citizen journalism, particularly in regards to the Gaza War. Congressmen have admitted as much.\n \nreply",
      "The concerns are quite literally about adversarial foreign governments being able to silently target messages to highly-influenced demographics en masse.I swear I have heard zero people opposed to the ban who seem to even be vaguely aware of that aspect which is the entire actual issue, and instead are completely confused and think it\u2019s about spyware or hacking. Whether or not you agree with the ban, we need to actually be discussing the same underlying issue.",
      "Many speculate that the prevalence of anti-prop on Israel-Palestine was a big motivator.I thought this was rather reductionist until TikTok was allowed back temporarily, only for pro-Plaestine slogans to be suddenly banned when it returned.Is it the only motivation? No. Given the above and the fact that dozens of highly popular Chinese apps continue to be allowed, does it appear likely this is a leading reason? Plausible.\n \nreply",
      "That + domestic social media protectionism\n \nreply",

The participants are very well connected (e.g. also supported by HF, Together and the likes with European roots)\n- Deepseek has just shown that you probably can't beat the big labs with these resources, but you can stay sufficient close to the frontier to make a dent.Europe needs to try this. Will this close the Gap to the US/China? Probably not. But it could be a catalyst for competitive Open source models and partially revitalize AI in Europe. let's see..PS: on Twitter there was a screenshot yesterday that in a new EU draft, \"accelerate\" was used six times.

      "\"in theory\" Linux, at least, was supposed to use rdrand's output as _one_ source of entropy, not _the only_ source.No idea what Windows et al do for this, or if that's still true, but I believe the above description was how the argument was originally ended.Also, tbh, if you can patch arbitrary instruction behavior, just replacing rdrand seems like far too ham fisted a tool with the level of versatility in your hands...\n \nreply",
      "Linux's rdrand use is proof against it returning bad output, but is not proof against malicious microcode. Reason for this is that the malicious microcode can examine register contents and alter the value it's returning so that mixing it into the previous source of randomness produces the desired evil value.\n \nreply",

      "The thing is, all the other ways you can compromise the kernel from microcode are at least theoretically detectable. A security researcher could study how the cpu operates and find the exploit. If RDRAND is surreptitiously replacing all your random numbers with AES of the current time, you cannot find that out from observing behavior.I agree that worrying about RDRAND shouldn't probably be on the top of anyone's priorities, but there is some cause to at least use it defensively, for example using it to pre-fill buffers with random values in a different context, so that subversion would in the very least require memory references, instead of running RDRAND in the context of your RNG.\n \nreply",

Nurses cursed me, touched me without consent, and several doctors examined me.

      "In a sensu stricto it's illegal, but practically and regrettably they are able to make that call, because though there are rules against it, unless the sergeant at arms of the senate goes out and handcuffs them, nobody is going to stop them. When the executive branch and the judiciary both decide to ignore the legislative branch, what is the legislative branch going to do?\n \nreply",
      "Our legislative branch is unable to even minimally fulfill its Constitutional duties.We haven't declared war since WWII, but we've waged a number of them.The Congressional budget process is fundamentally broken and increasingly nondemocratic - the leadership of both parties get \"continuing resolutions\" passed while they draft a mountainous \"omnibus\" bill that includes all their pork and graft, then they whip the members of the majority party to pass it without reading it.The Congressional oversight committees are usually captured by the industries and/or agencies they oversee.Congressional hearings are not used to inform Congress or the people; they're nakedly partisan acting gigs for committee members.Congress has unconstitutionally delegated much of its authority to a bureaucracy run by the executive branch, intending to have it operate independently of the president.  Now we have a president who is choosing to exercise his authority over the executive branch.Of course, it is illegal and unconstitutional for the president to eliminate programs that are established by law.  But remember the executive branch bureaucracy ONLY exists to allow the president to implement the laws passed by Congress.  If the laws aren't explicit or delegate to an executive branch agency HOW they law/program will be implemented, then the president has enormous authority over how to implement it, and there is nothing Constitutionally wrong with that.  So if the president says \"we don't need 10000 people to implement CFR 1.2.3 section 4, we only need 10\", and he can implement the law/program as passed by Congress with 10 people, then he's allowed to do that.The big problem is that Congress MUST depend on the executive branch to, er, execute.  Whatever is required to implement the law, that isn't specified in the law, is up to the executive branch, and the President is the head of that branch.And all this BS about \"classification\" again only exists to enable the president to do his job.  If the president says someone can have access to something, that is non-negotiable, as two USAID folks found out over the weekend.  The bureaucracy has for decades used classification to make a currency out of secrets and to try to avoid oversight.  Looks like that ride has ended.\n \nreply",
      "So, America has been dovetailing towards being a monarchy because Congress won\u2019t do their jobs, and it was inevitable that a President would eventually arrive who would wield that power? If nobody is willing to enforce the law, and the majority willingly hand the keys to the democracy to a single individual with dubious intentions, is it best to just accept this as the \u201cnatural order of things\u201d? The institutions that my generation was raised to respect as the foundations of the democracy seem to hold no weight or value, so it seems like the only thing left to do is just stand by to see what happens. I preemptively left the country last year and won\u2019t be back anytime soon, so as sad as I am to see this day, I\u2019m also strategically working to insulate myself from as much of the fallout as I can.\n \nreply",

Somehow the translator managed to translate the band name as Lion King. Which drastically changed the vibe of some scenes. Most probably the translator wasn\u2019t familiar with the band and had to translate it super fast.Similarly in the hungarian translation of Harry Potter Slytherin's Locket was translated as Slytherin's Lock.

One of the characters talks about getting someone a \"boogie board\" (a small surfboard) as a present.  This is translated as \"electronic memo pad\".

      "To me, software development is many things, but the inner loop is mainly characterized by two alternating modes: Trying things and Learning things.The biggest hidden assumption I see is that we expect other people to be trying and learning things in the same way we do.Experienced devs will write code to improve their own understanding, they will create tests to improve their own understanding, they will do research, they will do a lot of learning and all of that rarely gets talked about at standup or in a pull request. This work never shows up in a planning or budget meeting.I see junior devs getting stuck hard on delivering production ready code - which is the WORK PRODUCT that we want; but that is not what the actual work of software development looks like. A lot of junior devs are hesitant to do throw-away work that does not get committed to source control - they feel like someone out there knows the answer and they just have to find them. And for a long time, that works - they can find someone to provide the answer they need, they can find a senior dev who glances at the code and fixes it effortlessly.This whole thing is exacerbated by managers with no or minimal dev experience, who also confuse work product and tracked work items with the actual work of producing software.(And if you're wondering who 'junior devs' is, it's me.

This is particularly crucial for junior developers to grasp as you need to understand that your task is not done when you send your first push to git.I also agree wholeheartedly with automating best practices.

      "The approach at the end of declaring invariants to the compiler so the compiler can eliminate panics seems accidentally genius. You can now add the same invariants as panicking asserts at the end of each function, and the compiler will prove to you that your functions are upholding the invariants. And of course you can add more panicking asserts to show other claims to be true, all tested at compile time. You've basically built a little proof system.Sure, Rust is hardly the first language to include something like that and adoption of such systems tends to be ... spotty. But if it was reliable enough and had a better interface (that preferably allowed the rest of your program to sill have panics) this might be very useful for writing correct software.\n \nreply",
      "This isn't quite the same, but it reminds me of something a bit less clever (and a lot less powerful) I came up with  a little while back when writing some code to handle a binary format that used a lot of 32-bit integers that I needed to use for math on indexes in vectors. I was fairly confident that the code would never need to run on 16-bit platforms, but converting from a 32-bit integer to a usize in Rust technically is considered fallible due to the fact that you can't necessarily assume that a usize is more 16 bits, and frustrating `usize` only implements `TryFrom<u32>` rather than conditionally implementing `From<u32>` on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. I wanted to avoid having to do any casting that could silently get messed up if I happened to switch any of the integer types I used later, but I also was irrationally upset at the idea of having to check at runtime for something that should be obvious at compile time. The solution I came up with was putting a static assertion that the target pointer width was either 32 or 64 bits inside the error-handling path, followed by marking the code path as `unreachable!()` that would never get executed (because either the error handling path wouldn't be taken, or the static assertion would stop the code from having been compiled in the first place. Even though this wasn't meaningfully different from just conditionally compiling to make sure the platform was suitable and then putting `unreachable!()` unconditionally in the error handling path, having the compile-time insertion locally in the spot where the error was being handled felt like I magically turned the runtime error into a compile-time one; it was quite literally possible to write it as a function that could be dropped into any codebase without having to make any other changes to ensure it was used safely.\n \nreply",
      "While I would love this to be true, I'm not sure that this design can statically prove anything.  For an assert to fail, you would have to actually execute a code sequence that causes the invariant to be violated.

      "An assert is just a fancy `if condition { panic(message) }`. If the optimizer can show that condition is always false, the panic is declared as dead code and eliminated.

But you can also just check if panic code was generated (or associated code linked in), and if it was then the optimizer wasn't able to show that your assert can't happen.Of course this doesn't prove that the assert will happen. You would have to execute the code for that. But you can treat the fact that the optimizer couldn't eliminate your assert as failure, showing that either your code violates the assert, your preconditions in combination with the code aren't enough to show that the assert isn't violated, or the whole thing was too complicated for the optimizer to figure out and you have to restructure some code\n \nreply",
      "Ah, I see what you are saying.  Yes, if the optimizer is able to eliminate the postcondition check, I agree that it would constitute a proof that the code upholds the invariant.The big question is how much real-world code the optimizer would be capable of \"solving\" in this way.I wonder if most algorithms would eventually be solvable if you keep breaking them down into smaller pieces.  Or if some would have some step of irreducible complexity that the optimizer cannot figure out, now matter how much you break it down.\n \nreply",
      "For systems where correctness is actually important, not just a nice-to-have (in most systems, it's nice-to-have,) we have had an increasing number of options over the years.From tools like \"spin\" and \"tla+\" to proof assistants like Coq to full languages like Idris and Agda.Some of the stronger-typed languages already give us some of those benefits (Haskell, OCaml) and with restricted effects (like Haskell) we can even make the compiler do much of this work without it leaking into other parts of the program if we don't want it to.\n \nreply",
      "I've had an unpleasant amount of crashes with Rust software because people are way too quick to grab `panic!` as an out.This was most shocking to me in some of the Rust code Mozilla had integrated into Firefox (the CSS styling code). There was some font cache shenanigans that was causing their font loading to work only semi-consistently, and that would outright crash this subsystem, and tofu-ify CJK text entirely as a result.And the underlying panic was totally recoverable in theory if you looked at the call stack! Just people had decided to not Result-ify a bunch of falliable code.\n \nreply",
      "While sure, more things could be baked as results, most of the time when you see a panic that's not the case. It's a violation of the callee's invariants that the caller fucked up.Essentially an error means that the caller failed in a way that's expected. A panic means the caller broke some contract that wasn't expressed in the arguments.A good example of this is array indexing. If you're using it you're saying that the caller (whoever is indexing into the array) has already agreed not to access out of bounds. But we still have to double check if that's the case.And if you were to say that hey, that implies that the checks and branches should just be elided - you can! But not in safe rust, because safe code can't invoke undefined behavior.\n \nreply",
      "Sometimes the program is in an invalid state. You don't want to keep running the program. Better to fail spectacularly and clearly then to fail silently and try to hobble along.\n \nreply",
      "The thing with functional programming (specifically, immutable data,) is that as long as the invalid state is immutable, you can just back up to some previous caller, and they can figure out whether to deal with it or whether to reject up the its previous caller.This is why Result (or Maybe, or runExceptT, and so on in other languages) is a perfectly safe way of handling unexpected or invalid data. As long as you enforce your invariants in pure code (code without side effects) then failure is safe.This is also why effects should ideally be restricted and traceable by the compiler, which, unfortunately, Rust, ML, and that chain of the evolution tree didn't quite stretch to encompass.\n \nreply"
