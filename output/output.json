      "My dad was a busy construction contractor. One summer he tore himself away from work and took the family to a week long boat camp out next to a big beautiful lake. It turned out that our campsite was actually in the lake by a few inches at high water, but dad saw a way to dam it off and keep it dry, so he grabs the shovel and starts digging trenches and building walls and ordering us around.About an hour into that, pouring sweat, he stops cold and says \"what the hell am I doing?\" The flooded camp was actually nice on a hot day and all we really had to do was move a couple of tents. He dropped the shovel and spent the rest of the week sunbathing, fishing, snorkeling and water skiing as God intended. He flipped a switch and went from Hyde to Jekyll on vacation. I've had to emulate that a few times.reply",
      "My spouse and I dealt with this on our honeymoon. We were both working 50-80 hour weeks for months leading up to our trip. The first day we got to this all-inclusive resort we spent the whole time trying to min/max and be as efficient and calculated as possible. It was a stressful, miserable day.Day two we looked at each other, had an adult beverage with breakfast, and relaxed for the rest of the trip.reply",
      "This can work with the way you think as well.Many years ago, I had a technical manager who never felt any pressure to be the first to come up with the answer to a question or the solution to some problem. If I was having a technical conversation with him, and we arrived at a particularly subtle or complex issue, he could go completely silent, just staring straight ahead with his fingers to his lips. I would find it very uncomfortable, and I would start blurting out half-baked ideas to fill the silence, but he would either raise his finger or (usually) just ignore me. This could go on for 30-60 seconds, at which point he might shrug and say \"I don't know\" or, more likely, have a pretty well formed idea of how to move ahead.I used to joke to my co-workers that during those silent interludes, he was swapping in the solution from a remote disk.This manager also typed with one or two fingers, and pretty slowly too. But he wrote a lot of good code.reply",
      "If you\u2019re a fan of LOTR but don\u2019t fancy reading it aloud yourself, I\u2019d really recommend the new audio versions read by Andy Serkis. While I don\u2019t vibe with every facet of his performance, overall it\u2019s a tour-de-force, and really makes the prose come to life. Especially in those descriptive sections that it\u2019s possible to glaze over when reading the text. Having an actor of the calibre of Serkis reading them to you brings out the poetry and beauty of Tolkien\u2019s language.reply",
      "Noooo.  Audio books feed you the content at someone else\u2019s pace, not at your (slow) pace, which is exactly what TFA advocates. Or, what are you going to do? Hit Pause after each sentence so you can fully digest and savor it?reply",
      "An audiobook is bad if you want to go extra slow.  I don't think I want to go that slow.The article advocates not rushing.  In general, that's a good fit for audiobooks.reply",
      "The article literally says:> limiting myself to mouth-speedAudiobooks are mouth-speed.The article suggests this is the right slow speed, at least for the author.Maybe you yourself want even slower, but that's not what the article is suggesting.reply",
      "Use the playback speed settings, tough hitting pause every once in a while is also a good ideareply",
      "Audible and most audiobook player apps let you control the speed. I usually listen at 1.25 to 1.5reply",
      "First of all, I don\u2019t recommend going through life yucking someone else\u2019s yum.Second of all, I took TFA advice and read that article with the slowness and deliberate attention it recommended and found it to be trite and difficult to distinguish from AI slop\u2026 but if that\u2019s what brings this person joy, good for them.Who cares if the GP eats their cookies in one bite and listens to their audiobooks at 2.25x speed?

      "> Generally not that much has happened in 5 years, sometimes 10-15% improvements are posted that are later offset by bloat.Sorry but unless your workload is some C API numpy number cruncher that just does matmuls on the CPU, that's probably false.In 3.11 alone, CPython sped up by around 25% over 3.10 on pyperformance for x86-64 Ubuntu. https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#whatsnew311-fas...3.14 is 35-45% faster than CPython 3.10 for pyperformance x86-64 Ubuntu https://github.com/faster-cpython/benchmarking-publicThese speedups have been verified by external projects. For example, a Python MLIR compiler that I follow has found a geometric mean 36% speedup moving from CPython 3.10 to 3.11 (page 49 of https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/masters-project-report)Another academic benchmark here observed an around 1.8x speedup on their benchmark suite for 3.13 vs 3.10 https://youtu.be/03DswsNUBdQ?t=145CPython 3.11 sped up enough that PyPy in comparison looks slightly slower. I don't know if anyone still remembers this: but back in the CPython 3.9 days, PyPy had over 4x speedup over CPython on the PyPy benchmark suite, now it's 2.8 on their website https://speed.pypy.org/ for 3.11.Yes CPython is still slow, but it's getting faster :).Disclaimer: I'm just a volunteer, not an employee of Microsoft, so I don't have a perf report to answer to.

      "Ehh, PHP fits that bill and is clearly optimizable. All sorts of things worked well for PHP, including the original HipHop, HHVM, my own work, and the mainline PHP runtime.Python has some semantics and behaviors that are particularly hostile to optimization, but as the Faster Python and related efforts have suggested, the main challenge is full compatibility including extensions plus the historical desire for a simple implementation within CPython.There are limits to retrofitting truly high performance to any of these languages. You want enough static, optional, or gradual typing to make it fast enough in the common case. That's why you also saw the V8 folks give up and make Dart, the Facebook ones made Hack, etc. It's telling that none of those gained truly broad adoption though. Performance isn't all that matters, especially once you have an established codebase and ecosystem.reply"

      "Thanks for posting this detailed history and breakdown. And congratulations on your success. As someone with a podcast in the same ballpark of downloads, I will say it's a real testament to how much people must like The Program that you have managed to monetize to the tune of ~$30K CAD in a single year with just 140,000 downloads in the same year. That's really good! People must love what you're doing and that must be very gratifying. Cheers!reply",

I called Gemini out on that and it admitted that it over-egged its confidence on that assertion.But presumably the LLMs do have some knowledge about how they are used?On further probing Gemini did give a plausible justification - in summary:\"Creation is easy. Selection is hard. In an era of infinite content, the \"most successful\" writer isn't the one who can produce the most; it's the one with the best taste. Using an LLM as a distillation machine allows a writer to iterate through their own ideas at 10x speed, discarding the \"average\" and keeping only the \"potent.\"reply",
      "LLMs have no knowledge (really \u201cknowledge-like weights and biases\u201d) outside their training set and system prompt.

      "Why would Gemini (the text model part) have that info? I'm sure that Google has some kinda analytics, or so on, but it wouldn't necessarily be part of training, the system prompt, or distillation directly.reply",
      "I haven't really found a way to incorporate AI into my creative process.I do sometimes use it as thesaurus on steroids when I can't think of the right word or if I need to check grammar / sentence structure (I'm not a native speaker). I would never use AI in the way Gemini self-reports (and I doubt that's really a thing anyway).I might be tempted to use it for episode art if I didn't have access to a professional illustrator.I am experimenting with some AI-generated music at the moment, but that's for background cues that I'd use canned royalty-free music for anyway (emotionally important scenes have tailored-made music done by a professional composer).One way I'm eyeing to use AI in the future is as a way to translate what are currently audio stories into video. But I feel we're still not there.reply",

      "Pretty interesting approach to make an X server that is essentially \"Wayland-like\" (merging display server/compositor by default, isolated apps by default, no remoting of GLX, dropping legacy protocol features to the point of breaking compat with the core protocol, etc.). Not sure who this is for, but by itself it looks like a fairly reasonable set of choices.reply",
      "For people who absolutely have to have X11 this looks like a better plan than XLibre.reply",
      "It depends on whether their reasons for \"absolutely having to have X11\" hinge on actual compatibility with e.g. old binaries or wanting full remoting without streaming pixels.This project would satisfy people who really actually want Wayland, but were upset by transitional pains or interactions they had around it and want to stick with X11 just-cause while getting some similar benefits. This arguably does describe some people but not sure it's a whole lot in the long run.But who knows, maybe this could also make an easier to maintain XWayland some day, or a nice basis for implementing more esoteric X11 bits down the road vs. the older Xorg codebase.reply",
      "From my perspective X just got to the point where it just works for me few years ago and Wayland is just introducing more issues than it solves (to be clear it solves no current issue for me, only one that I think might be better for me is handling different refresh rate displays and maybe fractional scaling... and that could probably be done within X11)Like, why simple \"copy the screen\" got suddenly so complicated? Why every WM suddenly needs a bunch of features that before were just handled by display server, where they belong ? Why some(most) WMs handle title bars but GNOME doesn't ? Why someone decided title bar management is optional to window manager ?X11 might need to go but Wayland have learned no lessons from it. It's just knee-jerk \"if X11 done it this way, let's do it differently\"reply",
      "Whatever the issues with X11, it was properly designed. Wayland is the kind of software that adds features with nobody looking at the consequences. Who knows what they will break next version.reply",
      "From all the criticisms leveled at Wayland, this is definitely the strangest I've ever heard.I really cannot thing of any existing functionality ever broken by a new release of wayland-protocols, neither by a plain bug nor by a bad interaction. No doubt someone else will be able to recall an example, but it's really not a common thing.This is partially because the governance model and community mindset is the opposite of what you describe. Inclusion of new protocols in the stable release requires existing, proven implementations and consensus across multiple implementors, making it a high bar. New proposals run a gauntlet where pretty much everyone is looking at the consequences in detail.In fact a more common criticism of Wayland is that the focus on high quality and the consensus requirement are too strict and have slowed down filling in feature gaps users need filled faster. This argument I think can be successfully defended against - mainly, that it helps avoid the mess X11 became over time -, but at least has some basic merit in reality and is an avatar for genuine user pain.As for X11, as someone who had to implement a lot of X11 specs over the years, I can tell you that their provenance between X11 itself as well as ICCCM and EMWH had plenty of super dumb ideas and cruft and inconsistencies from lack of foresight and eventually datedness. You don't want to see the towering stack of hacks and heuristics we used to have to ship to make X11 behave somewhat consistently and sane :)In short, with all due respect, but I think you really don't know what you're talking about. We really should resist this type of narrative reality distortion field on an engineering forum.reply",
      "> making it a high barThat high bar is GNOME having an uppity whenever a Wayland protocol is suggested they don't like, that even if is accepted, if Mutter doesn't implement it then its dead in the water given its the de facto default compositor on unfortunately what people consider \"Linux\", aka Ubuntu.e.g. DRM leases that only got changed because Valve has the bigger underwear. Expecting games to implement DBUS (incl. when running under Wine) to access VR headsets just for GNOME is nuts.The government model needs a change that stakeholders who ship devices to the end users that rely on them have more of a say, whether that's Google, Valve etc. Valve is now backing and pushing KDE into average joe end users is a telling.reply",
      "Wayland design choices are heavily influenced by automotive and TV where it has been industry standard way before it became mostly usable as a desktop. And that has lead to design compromises that look odd on desktop.But hey, you can probably run automotive UIs with your desktop compositor.And Gnome devs are just being silly at this point.reply",

      "Commenting from the sidelines:Doesn't modern C++ offer the ability to write memory safe code? The primary distinguishing difference from Rust, on this front, is that Rust is memory safe by default (and allows them to override memory safety with code that is explicitly declared as unsafe) while C++ requires the developer to make a conscious effort to avoid unsafe code (without providing facilities to declare code as safe or unsafe). While this means that C++ is problematic, it does not make Rust automagically safer - particularly when interfacing with C/C++ code (as would be the case when interfacing with Linux syscalls or most C or C++ based libraries).I guess what I'm saying is that Rust is great when dealing exclusively with Rust libraries since it is either memory safe by default or because it is easier to audit (since it is either declared explicitly or implicitly as unsafe). On the other hand, it is not guaranteed to be memory safe. While this may sound like nitpicking, the distinction is important from the perspective of the end user who is unlikely to ever audit the code yet may be swayed by being told that it is written in a memory safe language.reply",
      "All languages offer the ability to write memory-safe code. It's just that doing so is very difficult in C and C++. The benefit of Rust isn't really the assurance of safety that's provided by not using the `unsafe` keyword. After all, pretty much all Rust programs do use the `unsafe` keyword. The benefit of Rust is a combination of many design decisions that make it easy to write safe code.For example, everyday operations in Rust are almost all defined. But in C++, it is extremely easy to run into undefined behavior by accident and make your code do something bizarre. On the practical side, I have never ever gotten a segfault when writing rust, but have many times in C++.reply",
      "If you're writing C/C++ and you don't care about memory safety, you're taking one of a few possible positions:1. \"I don't care what my program does.\"Why write it though?2. \"I don't care what the standard says, I've put text into a compiler and it gave me a binary that does the thing.\"What if you want to put the same text into a different compiler in the future, or the same compiler again? Are you certain the binary is going to continue doing the thing? Have you even fully tested the binary?3. \"I use a special runtime that makes memory unsafety defined again.\"One, I don't believe you unless you're part of a very small group of people and two, why are you accepting the serious drawbacks (performance, process death, all the broader issues of UB) that come with this?It's genuinely hard for me to understand why you wouldn't think memory safety is important Don't you want to write code that's portable and correct? Don't you want to execute other people's programs and trust they won't segfault? Doesn't it frustrate you that the language committees have spent years refusing to address even the lowest-hanging fruit?reply",
      "This site is curious in that in incorrectly categorizes go as memory safe.Perhaps in part because the sponsors are invested in using go and benefit from its inclusion in a list of memory safe languages.reply",
      "I am not sure if you are:1. attempting to retcon garbage collected languages as not memory safe, or2. discussing a particular implementation choice of the standard Go runtime that was made because it is not a practical source of bugs (see https://research.swtch.com/gorace, it is not an inherent feature of the language, just the implementation, and it is the right practical choice)But either way: this is the sort of thing I have seen again and again in the Rust \"community\" that I find deeply off-putting. Build good things, do not play snooty word games.reply",
      "If we're being extremely strict, Python probably also shouldn't be on that list because the CPython runtime is written in C and has had issues with memory safety in the past.Ultimately, \"memory safety\" is a conversation about what a program is intended to do and what semantics the language guarantees that program will have when executed. For the vast majority of programs, you can be just as confident that your Go and Python code will do the right things at runtime as your safe Rust. It's good enough.reply",
      "No, because then no language would be included, including Rust. Implementation bugs are not treated the same as integral parts of the language as defined by the standard. Python is defined as memory safe.reply"

      "The authors report that restoring NAD+ balance in the brain -- using a compound called P7C3-A20 -- completely reversed Alzheimer's pathology and recovered cognitive function in two different transgenic mouse models (one amyloid-based, one tau-based). The mice had advanced disease before treatment began.Three comments:- You can actually buy the drug here:  https://focusbiomolecules.com/p7c3-a20-nampt-activator-prone...\nIt's a simple small molecule.  If this stuff works, expect it to be everywhere within just a couple of years.- There's room for skepticism.  As Derek Lowe once wrote: \"Alzheimer's therapies have, for the most part, been a cliff over which people push bales of money. There are plenty of good reasons for this: we don't really know what the cause of Alzheimer's is, when you get down to it, and we're the only animal that we know of that gets it. Mouse models of the disease would be extremely useful \u2013 you wouldn't even have to know what the problem was to do some sort of phenotypic screen \u2013 but the transgenic mice used for these experiments clearly don't recapitulate the human disease. The hope for the last 25 years or so has been that they'd be close enough to get somewhere, but look where we are.\"> https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/just-how-worthless...- If the drug's mechanism of action has been correctly assigned, it's very plausible that simply supplementing with NMN, NR, or NADH would work equally well.  The authors caution against this on, IMO, extremely shaky and unjustified grounds.  \"Pieper emphasized that current over-the-counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer.\"reply",
      "> - You can actually buy the drug here: https://focusbiomolecules.com/p7c3-a20-nampt-activator-prone... It's a simple small molecule. If this stuff works, expect it to be everywhere within just a couple of years.There are numerous chemical supply companies that will list chemicals like this \u201cfor sale\u201d. They might not have it in stock but they hope they\u2019ll get your search traffic and be able to synthesize it if you place an order.If you look at the amounts, they\u2019re tiny. I don\u2019t know the doses that would be used in humans but typically ordering from chemical supply shops would be economically infeasible for just about any drug. These are meant for one-off studies and experiments, not ongoing human use.There have been a growing number of online groups arranging to do group buys of synthesized experimental drugs based on studies. I\u2019ve followed a few of them and the results range from people losing their money, receiving product that is too contaminated to use, or in some cases they go to great lengths to verify the chemical but then discover it doesn\u2019t do what the original study promised it would do. In some of the more horrifying cases I\u2019ve seen forum posts from people reporting long lasting chest pains from one chemical, and another chemical was sending people into psychosis. So if (when) these chemicals start appearing on group buy sites I suggest ignoring it until more research is done. Making yourself into a lab rat is not a good idea.reply",

      "The chemical the parent comment linked is different.NAD itself isn\u2019t usually supplemented because it\u2019s broken down by your digestive system. So NAD precursor supplements have been available for a while: NR and NMN specifically. These are the precursors they were talking about.The actual drug used in this study has a different mechanism of action. It\u2019s not directly available as a supplement, but like the parent commenter discovered you could technically find a chemical supply house to synthesize a tiny quantity of it.reply",

The tradeoff would be years of life.For the record, I have no idea what the actual risk tradeoff is, but the point of regulation is that nobody does. You can\u2019t have informed consent when you can\u2019t be informed.[1] Aside: Alzheimer\u2019s is relatively early stage, as dementias go. It\u2019s frequently diagnosed by onset in younger people.reply",
      "> There's room for skepticism.And there's room for thinking there's water in the ocean. We have no idea whether this would work at all or how it would work at all in humans. We have one experiment in mice, which as you say can't have Alzheimer's.This is a nice step, like developments in fusion energy. That's part of research, and let's hope and investigate it, but it's absurd to think about it as anything but a science project right now.reply",
      "Sadly, it's worse. We don't have one experiment that works in mice: we have dozens, if not hundreds. We've cured \"Alzheimer's in mice\" many times over. The treatments never work in humans, because it's not the same disease. We don't know the root cause of the human disease and so we can't model it accurately in mice.reply",

      "To put it simply, mice don't get Alzheimer's. We're not studying mice with Alzheimer's, we're studying mice with an mutation chosen for resembling Alzheimer's. But we don't know whether this model replicates the actual mechanisms of the disease, or if it's superficial.reply"
