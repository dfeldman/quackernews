      "If you read his last two novels he was clearly well-informed about mathematics.However I have to assume that McCarthy didn't actually master all the material in the math books mentioned here, I think the reporter may be a little too credulous about that. I suspect he had the very common experience of buying a yellow book and being defeated in the first couple chapters.reply",

I have only read \"Child of God\" and wondered why someone might write about the worst among us. But then I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino as a filmmaker for the same reason.reply",
      "I hope, at least, you managed to watch the films before you had an opinion on them. Tarantino's, I mean.The Road is not a violent or pessimistic book, tho there is violence and pessimism in it. Don't confuse the set and the setting.Why write about, 'the worst among us'? Some art (and Cormac tottered over the line between wrought and overwrought plenty) is about finding meaning in the margins, in the edge cases. The statistical noise at the outerbands of anything might make it an impossible endeavor for meaning-making, but that's why art. You try anyway. Some writers are skilled enough to make the mundane sing and that's great, but McCarthy obviously didn't seem to care for that approach.I think I can see why Child of God put you off enough for the thoughts of others to prevent any further effort, but I'd suggest you give him another go.I'd save blood meridian for later tho; If you don't get too distracted by the setting of the road, it's a perfectly optimistic book.As the poet said, something in us does not erode (free pun!)reply",
      "I\u2019ve only read The Road and found it extremely difficult because of the nihilism. I put it down in the middle of it and stewed for 6 months before I picked it up again. I am so glad I did. I think his detractors are right, it is violent, nihilistic, masculine and whatever else. Through that the other side of the contrast becomes so vivid. Maybe there are better ways to get there.  For me it hit.My daughter and I talk about the message in the book regularly. Though she has yet to read it. I see more clearly my purpose as a dad and as a member in my community. Totally worth the read.reply",
      "I've always gotten the sense from McCarthy that he was keenly aware that civilization is not just something to take for granted and that there is always something dangerous at the edges that needs to be carefully guarded against.reply",
      "You don't have to love them, but dismissing two of the 20th century's great artists in their respective mediums while having a blog named \"engineersneedart\" is certainly ironic.reply",

      "I understand this provides a way to interact with ts data via natural language, but is there any benefit to this over tool calling to a library that uses signal processing and/or rule based algos (or using machine learning if the data is noisy/variable)?For example, you ask an off-the-shelf LLM to analyze your ECG data. The LLM uses a tool to call out to your ECG ts analysis library. The library iterates over the data and finds stats & ECG events. It returns something like \"Average heart rate: 60bpm, AFib detected at <time>, etc...\". The LLM has all the info it needs to give an accurate analysis at a fraction of computational cost.On top of that, this requires a large annotated dataset and a pre-trained model. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it's possible to have a \"general\" model that could handle arbitrary time series data. I.e. a model that is trained on ECG data would not be compatible with stock market data. And there isn't a way to have a model that understands both stock market data and ECG data.reply",

Treat other people as you want to be treated, and modulo rare interactions with asshole people, you get along well.For autistic people interacting with most non-autistic people, you've got to use the diamond rule.  Treat other people as they want to be treated.I love when people just straight up tell me directly that I am wrong because of X and Y.  Give me Crocker's rules.

I am well aware that for kids with autism frequently there are feeding issues, but what's going on in the \"simulation\" is very not clear to me.Similarly, I don't understand the decisions related to the driving environment: it appears to be a personal vehicle, surely you, as the owner, can make the interior environment something that's as close to personally comfortable as possible? Maybe I'm missing the takeaway from the driving decisions.Related, what is or isn't masking seems very confused. To begin with, it's not just code for \"hiding or not hiding behaviors that appear socially irregular.\" But it's also not the case that deciding whether to participate in a non-working-hours event is or isn't masking in of itself.Presenting behavior in a socialized way when necessary is a skill that's harder (as I understand it) for those on the autism spectrum, but I don't think that makes every application equivalent to masking.reply",

Which is different from the meds constipation. So eating is difficult. Because of IBS my bowels are also unpredictable, so dosing laxatives is hard. I don't know how many of these things are caused by meds.Then there's the energy thing. I guess if I'm in ketosis it's fine, but after not eating for a whole day it's hard to sustain the next day, but eating isn't alway worth it.The saddest part is that junk foot and Tesco meal deal is so is somehow easier to digest. So I often eat that.I'm trying Kefir (even though I'm lactose intolerant, but I take lactase with it) for the 10 time probably. My GP recommended it. Alas, maybe it helps.Soooo, tldr eating yes, I love it, but it can have consequences that completely tank my productivity.

      "Just wanted to say, thanks for doing this! Now the old rant...I started my career when on-prem was the norm and remember so much trouble. When you have long-lived hardware, eventually, no matter how hard you try, you just start to treat it as a pet and state naturally accumulates. Then, as the hardware starts to be not good enough, you need to upgrade. There's an internal team that presents the \"commodity\" interface, so you have to pick out your new hardware from their list and get the cost approved (it's a lot harder to just spend a little more and get a little more). Then your projects are delayed by them racking the new hardware and you properly \"un-petting\" your pets so they can respawn on the new devices, etc.Anyways, when cloud came along, I was like, yeah we're switching and never going back.  Buuut, come to find out that's part of the master plan: it's a no-brainer good deal until you and everyone in your org/company/industry forgets HTF to rack their own hardware, and then it starts to go from no-brainer to brainer.  And basically unless you start to pull back and rebuild that muscle, it will go from brainer to no-brainer bad deal. So thanks for building this muscle!reply",

      "I've setup on-prem environments that would automatically and transparently spill workload to the cloud when we ran out of on-prem capacity. The prerequisite is that your operations people need to have strong automation skills, there can't be any human button-pushers in the loop, but it really isn't that much work nor does it require unusual technical skill if you have a competent operations environment. Once everything is wired up, it mostly just works. Even the devs often don't know whether their workloads are running on-prem or in the cloud.An under-rated aspect of this is that it provides detailed data for planning the expansion of the on-prem environment, including changes in how the hardware is being used.My experience is that this is a good model. On-prem is about 1/3 the cost of the cloud, fully burdened, in my experience but being able to transparently spill to the cloud mitigates the capacity and supply chain risks that come with on-prem.It is effectively a cheap insurance policy.reply",

I didn't even tell it what linters to use, I asked it for suggestions and it gave me about a dozen of suggestions, I installed them and it started using them without further instruction.I had tried coding with ChatGPT a year or so ago and the effort needed to get anything useful out of it greatly exceeded any benifit, so I went into CC with low expectations, but have been blown away.reply",
      "As an extension of this idea: for some tasks, rather than asking Claude Code to do a thing, you can often get better results from asking Claude Code to write and run a script to do the thing.Example: read this log file and extract XYZ from it and show me a table of the results. Instead of having the agent read in the whole log file into the context and try to process it with raw LLM attention, you can get it to read in a sample and then write a script to process the whole thing. This works particularly well when you want to do something with math, like compute a mean or a median. LLMs are bad at doing math on their own, and good at writing scripts to do math for them.A lot of interesting techniques become possible when you have an agent that can write quick scripts or CLI tools for you, on the fly, and run them as well.reply",
      "It's a bit annoying that you have to tell it to do it, though. Humans (or at least programmers) \"build the tools to solve the problem\" so intuitively and automatically when the problem starts to \"feel hard\", that it doesn't often occur to the average programmer that LLMs don't think like this.When you tell an LLM to check the code for errors, the LLM could simply \"realize\" that the problem is complex enough to warrant building [or finding+configuring] an appropriate tool to solve the problem, and so start doing that... but instead, even for the hardest problems, the LLM will try to brute-force a solution just by \"staring at the code really hard.\"(To quote a certain cartoon squirrel, \"that trick never works!\" And to paraphrase the LLM's predictable response, \"this time for sure!\")reply",
      "As the other commenter said, these days Claude Code often does actually reach for a script on its own, or for simpler tasks it will do a bash incantation with grep and sed.That is for tasks where a programmatic script solution is a good idea though. I don't think your example of \"check the code for errors\" really falls in that category - how would you write a script to do that? \"Staring at the code really hard\" to catch errors that could never have been caught with any static analysis tool is actually where an LLM really shines! Unless by \"check for errors\" you just meant \"run a static analysis tool\", in which case sure, it should run the linter or typechecker or whatever.reply",
      "Running \u201cthe\u201d existing configured linter (or what-have-you) is the easy problem. The interesting question is whether the LLM would decide of its own volition to add a linter to a project that doesn\u2019t have one; and where the invoking user potentially doesn\u2019t even know that linting is a thing, and certainly didn\u2019t ask the LLM to do anything to the project workflow, only to solve the immediate problem of proving that a certain code file is syntactically valid / \u201cnot broken\u201d / etc.After all, solving an immediate problem that seems like it could come up again, by \u201ctaking the opportunity\u201d to solve the problem from now on by introducing workflow automation to solve the problem, is what an experienced human engineer would likely do in such a situation (if they aren\u2019t pressed for time.)reply",
      "Cursor does this for me already all the time though, give that another shot maybe. For refactoring tasks in particular; it uses regex to find interesting locations , and the other day after maybe 10 of slow \"ok now let me update this file... ok now let me update this file...\" it suddenly paused, looked at the pattern so far, and then decided to write a python script to do the refactoring & executed it. For some reason it considered its work done even though the files didn't even pass linters but thats' polish.reply",
      "I've noticed Claude doing this for most tasks without even asking it to.  Maybe a recent thing?reply",
      "Yes. But not always. It's better if you add a line somewhere reminding it.reply",
      "I have a Just task that runs linters (ruff and pyright, in my case), formatter, tests and pre-commit hooks, and have Claude run it every time it thinks it's done with a change. It's good enough that when the checks pass, it's usually complete.reply"

What started as a tool I ran in parallel with other tools to aid coding has turned into my full-fledged agentic operating system, supporting all kinds of workflows.Most notably, Obsidian, the tool I use for note-taking. The difference between Obsidian and Notion or Evernote is that all the files are just plain old Markdown files stored on your computer. You can sync, style, and save them, but ultimately, it's still a text file on your hard drive. A few months ago, I realized that this fact made my Obsidian notes and research a particularly interesting target for AI coding tools. What first started with trying to open my vault in Cursor quickly moved to a sort of note-taking operating system that I grew so reliant on, I ended up standing up a server in my house so I could connect via SSH from my phone into my Claude Code + Obsid"

Clockwork PI and full Ubuntu seem a little bit like overkill.I'd like to have a cool BASIC or Forth implementation and use a fun stack like that, but without being able to hit an API I'm not sure I will be motivated to use it.This seems like a big improvement here, maybe I take a look at the LilyGo.

      "Just about every modem that can do actual real 4G cell phone connectivity is built around a SoC that blows the socks off your usual microcontroller.The cheapest noname 4G USB stick you can buy now probably has a Qualcomm MSM8916 in it, and runs, I shit you not, Android.As you can imagine, development with this kind of thing can be rather involved. No open development kits are available. There are no reference designs that don't require you to sign off on an NDA to access it, and Qualcomm wouldn't even want to talk to you unless you are at least \"MOQ 100000+\" tall.The best you can do is get an existing modem module that hopefully doesn't bury too many of the interfaces you want, try to run your firmware on it, and then design your own board around that.Which would probably yield a device that's inferior to most cheap smartphones or even feature phones.reply",

There's almost always wifi available and if not you almost always have a phone with an internet connection.

I don't feel bad about other people because I've been a victim myself and as a tech person, I also get the privilege of being labelled as part of the oppressor class, while being oppressed by them... While working one of the most competitive and mentally-taxing jobs in the history of humanity... Seeing the harms, understanding the problems, seeing the solutions but being so powerless that I'm literally forced to work for the oppressor.I feel too much pain to feel any guilt.

      "Stirrups.The roman empire collapsed because a bunch of itinerant peasants in the desert invented a loop of metal that allowed them to ride faster on a horse and destroy roman formations on the battlefield.The romans also invented a form of self healing concrete that allowed their buildings to last to the present day and we only discovered how it was made within the last five years (and to my knowledge it still isn't widely used). It still didn't save them. Civilizations collapse because they can't take care of their least fortunate, they can't keep the water and food supply clean, and because people that require less resources to succeed end up replacing them. And then they build in all the comforts that the people they replaced had, they become soft and are taken over by the next group of idiots that finds a way to cross their moat or knock down their walls.Despite speaking as if he's doing his utmost to have a love affair with the Cambridge dictionary (and sounding like a twat at the same time) he's not wrong in so far as not giving a shit is going to screw him over when the ability to push buttons in front of a television no longer matters. What happens when the guys hanging around doing meth on the sidewalk become the engineers that end up becoming the super biologist supermen that cure cancer make us able to hear what dogs hear and see extra colors? It's unlikely, but it's even less likely that everyone who is a middle class engineer will be so tomorrow. There is no moat in any profession outside of entrenched wealth or guns at the moment. There just isn't - we're in a permanent state of future shock along with the singularity. In large part because that's what people decided that they wanted.And not going to lie - the guy does sound like someone that's off their meds and doesn't know how to project a real personality so he's surrounding himself with a wall of fancy pants words to sound \"totally legit bro\" type shit. This coming from a guy who's first instinct in ebonics is to hate it with a fucking passion. Like \"total American psycho\" vibes except with locution. Some people I see on the streets of San Francisco or elsewhere will have the American Psycho \"vibe\" - god I hate that word. In any case - that's a \"book\" that someone can be \"killed\" to which is a thing where people will fuck with someone that likes to read by screwing with them. The one that douchecanoes in San Francisco are attempting to do to me is \"Withnail & I\" wherein they'll attempt to find ways of fucking with me if I only talk to homeless or fucked up weirdos if I'm doing an activity that requires someone have an addiction. They're getting really fucking desperate at this point too - like sitting down next to me and smacking their lips while they eat like food is an addiction or seeing if they can give me sick if I talk to someone at the coffee stand. Because I dislike going around San Francisco where people were smoking meth and fent and I smoked a joint (one) and I drank (like six handles of alcohol over the course of three years) and I smoked (but like half a dozen packs of cigarettes over three years). It's a joke I believe to the book Entangled Life which has a mushroom that's eating a cigarette which itself is a joke to the movie airplane which may itself be a joke about the book the illuminatus trilogy which itself may be a joke about blue jeans and pedophilia (not a pedophile). There's a bunch of these \"traps\" that are convolutional ways to fuck with someone. So if you jerk off it's this trap, if you got into a fist fight one time it's the American Psycho trap, etc, where they (and it's some group of fuckers that have decided to screw with you in a group) will surround you with a group of assholes that are attempting to fuck up your life by manipulating you.This is the \"freedom\" joke having to do with the statue of liberty and people that read because it's psychological. There's a whole nother tree of asshole for people that are into music that has to do with buddhism or something. This stupid shit is everywhere in San Francisco. More or less anyone involved in it is a massive piece of shit.Oh and Statue of Liberty with four eyes is \"spiderman\", buddhist with headphones is \"batman\", and Marylin Monroe with mask is \"the shadow\", and so on. There's another one for superman I believe - it would probably be Harry Potter is Superman as a joke on national socialism and the will to power. Which is again like helter skelter and Ra the SS and Rascals which is the next CIA thing.Correlate that to Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. Which is which superhero?It must be an instagram joke.So it's more stupid having to do with fucking with people. I just can't keep a secret for shit and I hate it when people fuck with me constantly.I mean speaking of Company Man or whatever. This version of the economy is at about peak stupid and is going to implode within a year. AI will be just the thing that people use to change their oil or turn the faucet on or what have you and there won't be any money in it anymore. Genetic algorithms, self healing code, platform as a service by telling google you want one. Coding will become a thing that you just have your digital unicorn do for you and all the money will be in trading hair dos for the next version of Microsoft's clippy.Personally I'm more worried that books are trapped in a feedback loop in which people are just scraping culture from what used to exist -How is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Model any different from \"The Remains of the Day\"? How is \"Death Valley\" (a new book) different than taking a section from The Illuminatus Trilogy? The question here isn't so much whether or not someone is free or not to do something, but whether people are using their freedom to use something akin to the xerox effect to purposefully create as much anti-information noise as possible while culture dies out of stagnation. If a country is relatively soft compared to the rest of the world where do their epics come from? Do people understand or care about what an adventure novel is about if they don't ever experience adventure in their lives? How long would it take a people to not be able to tell fiction that is written in good faith with something claiming to be but isn't? How would anyone know the difference? Even this is an example of only one type of obfuscation having to do with I believe certain branches of Christian satanism (the lie). Is it good or bad (culture jamming)? To what degree is culture important?One of the things that I worry about is that anyone that writes books in english may be rehashing plots that have been written about already to the point where english may die out. Using an algorithm you should be able to compare the creativity of works over time and I would argue that books in english (what about art) are becoming less creative as time goes on. I don't believe this is necessarily the sky is falling type shit either. How many RPGs exist in which the main (female) character is realistic as a fighter - not to break or create gender roles but merely as something different (and interesting) artistically? It almost doesn't exist at all. Or ugliness in visual media. I don't think that it exists as an art form and I don't think you could make a video game in which everything wasn't some degree of high gloss and shiny. In movies for a long time you had a color palette that was primarily all blues and oranges (why?  - possibly it could have had something to do with getting around someone adding green screen to the background in order to doctor the film in some way - maybe). OKHSL has a color palette with high saturation colors - and yet Mad Magazine has a higher color saturation content (see the latest on mad science) than any movie made within the last year. You'll have a 100 million dollar plus movie where the color palette looks awful. I've even seen some of the newer cinematography that relies on three d filming affects and even with the added depth of field it has less visual interest than Hammer films from the 70s.Look at the plots of Jack Vance, Philip K. Dick, Hp Lovecraft, Robert Anton Wilson, Samuel R Delaney, to name a few. Stories these days are downright boring in comparison to many of them. And I'm a millenial so this is my parent's generation. The new weird is cool - I like China Meiville and some of Jeff Vandermeer. And then you read Clarice Lispector and you're left wondering the extent that he was scraping his artistic technique from her stuff.I don't know where culture is right now in the sense that I don't know what people care about in such a way where not bandwagon appeal but how to fit into society in such a way where I can both be useful and I understand it.reply",

Conditions on guards were written in a tiny expression language we wrote, enabling you to look at various signals from the hardware and software at runtime and make decisions based off them.The nice part of this setup was that it opened up a path for doing more formal analysis on the behavior. E.g. you could easily find \"terminal\" states that you could enter but not leave. You can also imagine things like checking things like which states in a parallel or in concurrently running machines, aren't allowed to be active, and verifying there is no path in the state graph that allowed that to occur.

      "In any case, it seems like a \"simple\" problem to solve. An accelerometer chip costs a few cents and the data rates can be handled by a very light wiring harness, ex I2C.So embedding such a sensor in every rigid component, wiring a single data line to all of them (using the chassis as electrical ground) and feeding the data back to the model seems a trivial way to work around this problem without any kind of real pressure sensitivity. The model knows the inputs it gives to the actuators/servos, so it will quickly learn to predict the free mechanical behavior of the body, and use any deviation to derive data equivalent to pressure and force feedback.Another possible source of data is the driving current of the motors/actuators which is proportional to the mechanical resistance  the limb encounters.

      "I feel that a lot of the times conversations around this topic end up with some anecdote like \"well, playing politics doesn't actually work because I work at a dysfunctional company where decisions are made by morons\". If you have a C-suite that makes decisions based on golf games, this advice is not for you. You have a different set of problems. You should absolutely address those problems. But that doesn't mean that this advice isn't for anyone, and coming and telling everyone that the advice is always meaningless isn't accurate.It's like two people discussing how to handle difficult conversations in a romantic relationship, and a third guy comes in and says \"this conversation is irrelevant because every time I date someone they cheat on me\". I'm sorry you're dealing with that problem, but it is not really related to the topic at hand.reply",

For years as an engineer, I wore my hatred of politics like a badge of honor. I was above all that nonsense. I just wanted to ship.

And pretending politics doesn\u2019t exist? That\u2019s how bad politics wins.Politics is just how humans coordinate in groups. It\u2019s the invisible network of relationships, influence, and informal power that exists in every organization. You can refuse to participate, but that doesn\u2019t make it go away.

One use case is to write a command that lets the user choose an element and copy its text.reply"

      "Always overlooked point in these pro/anti-spreadsheet discussions:A spreadsheet gives you a DB, a quickly and easily customized UI, and iterative / easy-to-debug data processing all in a package that everyone in the working world already understands. AND with a freedom that allows the creator to do it however they want. AND it's fairly portable.You can build incredible things in spreadsheets. I remain convinced that it's the most creative and powerful piece of software we have available, especially so for people who can't code.With that power and freedom comes downsides, sure; and we can debate the merits of it being online, or whether this or that vendor is preferable; but my deep appreciation for spreadsheets remains undiminished by these mere trifles.It's the best authoring tool we've ever devised.EDIT TO ADD: the only other thing that seems to 'rhyme' with spreadsheets in the same way is: HyperCard. Flexible workbench that let you stitch together applications, data, UX, etc. RIP HyperCard, may you be never forgotten.reply",
      "Right? Spreadsheets have such a low barrier of entry. I use Google Sheets in a middle of a farm field to enter plant growing records on my cell phone. I don't even have good reception at times so the sheets are in offline mode; they'll synch when I get back to the house. \nCrappy, crummy records are oftentimes better than no records. Farming is data-heavy and data-starved at the same. A learning cycle is a year, and one year is not like the other one.reply",
      "> especially so for people who can't code.And for those who can, Appscript gives your spreadsheet super powers.For those who don't know, you are not stuck with writing JS in the Appscript integrated web IDE that comes with Google sheets (though honestly it's not too bad itself).Using clasp, you can develop your code locally in an IDE of your choice, in typescript and have a build step compile those to js, and have clasp push it to spreadsheet.Once you have the tool chain set up the DX is quite nice.reply",
      "I spent some time with Apps Script a few weeks ago. It has some strange design decisions:1) Everything runs on the server, including triggers and even custom functions! This means every script call requires a roundtrip, every cell using a custom function requires a roundtrip on each change, and it feels much slower than the rest of the UI.2) You can't put a change trigger on a cell or subset of cells, only on the whole sheet. So you have to manually check which cell the trigger happened on.3) Reading and writing cell values is so slow (can be a second or more per read or write) that the semi-official guidance is to do all reads in a bunch, then all writes in a bunch. And it's still slow then.4) A lot of functionality, like adding custom menus, silently doesn't work on mobile. If your client wants to use Sheets on mobile, get ready to use silly workarounds, like using checkboxes as buttons to trigger scripts and hoping the user doesn't delete them.Overall I got the feeling that Google never tried to \"self host\" any functionality of core Sheets using Apps Script. If they tried, it'd be much faster and more complete.reply",
      "> Everything runs on the server, including triggersI think that\u2019s a consequence of the fact that multiple users can simultaneously edit a sheet. Yes, Google could special-case the \u201cyou are the single user of this sheet\u201d case, but that\u2019s extra work, and, I think, would be fairly complicated when handling edge cases where users frequently start and stop editing a sheet.reply",
      "> 2) You can't put a change trigger on a cell or subset of cells, only on the whole sheet. So you have to manually check which cell the trigger happened on.This is true of MS Excel's scripting language (VBA) as well. Worksheets are objects with events; cells are objects without (VBA-accessible) events.It may be an issue with scaling and efficiency.reply",
      "But Google Sheets remote procedure calls are vastly slower than local OLE/COM dispatching. (And VBA/Excel presumably uses the optimized tighter COM interface binding instead of the slower high level COM IDispatch. Sure there's some overhead but it's nothing compared to Google Sheet's network overhead.)Not only is scripting Google Sheets indeterminently and syrupy slow, it also imposes an arbitrary limit on how long your code can run, making a lot of applications not just inefficient but impossible. Running your code in google's cloud doesn't make spreadsheet api calls any faster, it just limits how long you can run, them BAM!To get anything non-trivial done, you have to use getSheetValues and ranges to read and write big batches of values as 2d arrays.https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsh...It's easier to just download the entire spreadsheet csv or layers and bang on that from whatever language you want, instead of trying to use google hosted spreadsheet scripts.reply",
