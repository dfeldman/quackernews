      "I think there's a key context difference here in play which is that AI tools aren't better than an expert on the language and code base that is being written. But the problem is that most software isn't written by such experts. It's written by people with very hazy knowledge of the domain and only partial knowledge of the languages and frameworks they are using. Getting it to be stylistically consistent or 100% optimal is far from the main problem. In these contexts AI is a huge help, I find.\n \nreply",
      "> It takes me at least the same amount of time to review code not written by me than it would take me to write the code myself, if not more.As someone who uses Claude Code heavily, this is spot on.LLMs are great, but I find the more I cede control to them, the longer it takes to actually ship the code.I\u2019ve found that the main benefit for me so far is the reduction of RSI symptoms, whereas the actual time savings are mostly over exaggerated (even if it feels faster in the moment).\n \nreply",
      "I get confused when I see stances like this, because it gives me the sense that maybe people just aren't using coding tools efficiently.90% of my usage of Copilot is just fancy autocomplete: I know exactly what I want, and as I'm typing out the line of code it finishes it off for me. Or, I have a rough idea of the syntax I need to use a specific package that I use once every few months, and it helps remind me what the syntax is, because once I see it I know it's right. This usage isn't really glamorous, but it does save me tiny bits of time in terms of literal typing, or a simple search I might need to do. Articles like this make me wonder if people who don't like coding tools are trying to copy and paste huge blocks of code; of course it's slower.\n \nreply",

But it isn't an anti-AI post either, at least I don't think it is. There are already plenty of articles by AI promoters and AI critics, so I don't feel there is a need for me to write one more of those. While I'm definitely not neutral on the subject, in this article I'm just going to share my personal experience with these tools, from a strictly technical point of view.Really the main and most important reason why GenAI tools do not work for me is that they do not make me any faster. It's really that simple.It would be easy to use GenAI coding tools to have code written for me. A coding agent would be the most convenient, as it would edit my files while I do something else.

The theory of DRM is for the system to restrict the content from the user, i.e. the system is adversarial to the user and vice versa.What Signal is doing is trying to get the system to restrict the content from the rest of the system. Which might work as a transient hack but doesn't actually work to protect the user when the system is adversarial, because Microsoft (the adversary) has the DRM private keys.

But after reading docs and comments, it sounds like this needs to manage my K8s for me? \nI guess my question is: \n1) When I spin up a \"Cluster\" on Hetzner, is that just dividing up a single machine, or is it a true K8s cluster that spans across multiple machines? \n2) If I run this install script on another server, does it join the cluster, giving me true distributed servers to host the pods?\n3) Is there a way to take an existing managed K8s and have Canine deploy to it?\n \nreply",
      "Yeah so at the moment it kind of supports two options:\n1. A single Hetzner VPS\n2. An existing Kubernetes cluster.I usually use #1 for staging / development apps, and then #2 for production apps. For #2, I manage the number of nodes on the Digital Ocean side, and kubernetes just magically reschedules my workload accordingly (also can turn on auto scaling).I think the thing that you're getting at that is not supported is having Canine create a multi-node cluster directly within Hetzner.There is a terraform to create a Kubernetes cluster from hetzner, but this isn't currently installed on Canine.I'm not closed to trying it out, there were a few UI improvements I wanted to take a shot at first, but at the moment Canine assume's you have a cluster ready to go, or can help you walk through a K3s installation to a single VPS.https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzne...\n \nreply",

My dad was a chemical engineer for an oil company, and he often spoke of spills and incidents. As a kid, I never understood what it was, but the tone and urgency were always something scary.I also strongly suspect my mother's Benzene exposures (nurse cleaning lab slides with Benzene and no PPE) led to me battling Langerhans Histiocytosis throughout my childhood.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langerhans_cell_histiocytosis\n \nreply",
      "> Its peculiar behaviour, such as its surprising stability despite being highly unsaturated, hinted at a deeper mystery that would not be fully resolved until the mid-19th century with the proposal of its cyclic structure.How were chemists in the early 19th century able to determine benzene must be highly unsaturated without knowing its structure? Did they simply combust it and measure the amount of water vapor and carbon dioxide produced?\n \nreply",
      "There's a two step-process to stochiometry.The first step, as people have elaborated below, is combust the compound and measure the weights of various oxides, which (after the atomic masses of the relevant elements were settled around the 1820s) lets you work out the empirical formula of an unknown molecule. For benzene, this would tell you that there is 1 C : 1 H, but this doesn't tell you if it's C\u2084H\u2084 or C\u2086H\u2086 or C\u2081\u2081\u2081H\u2081\u2081\u2081.The second step is to determine the molar mass of your compound, which requires finding something that depends on the amount of substance but not the mass directly. (In modern times, this is primarily mass spec). Back in the 19th century, this is probably abusing the ideal gas law, which lets you compute the number of moles in a gas given the pressure, temperature, and volume of a vessel. Combine this with the mass of that container, and you know how much a mole weighs.

      "This story is dear to my heart. Let me tell you why - this is the tale of how my wife of 15 years, bless her heart, an occasional unstable genius, proposed a startlingly effective method for eradicating these invasive pythons.She slammed her coffee cup down one morning with the conviction of an Old Testament prophet and declared: \u201cExploding rabbits.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I said, wiping marmalade off my chin.\u201cExploding. Rabbits. Stuff \u2018em with quarter pound of C4, or maybe just enough tannerite to surprise the neighbors but not call down the FAA, and set them loose in the Everglades. Pythons love rabbits. Boom. Problem solved. You\u2019re welcome, America.\u201dNow I\u2019ve heard my share of madcap schemes. Once she tried to compost credit card offers. But this time she looked me square in the eye with the righteous glow of a woman who had just solved two ecological crises and accidentally founded a billion-dollar startup in the process.\u201cWe\u2019ll call it Hare Trigger\u2122,\u201d she added, deadpan. \u201cIt\u2019s got product-market fit and explosive growth potential.\u201dShe even sketched out a logo involving a jackrabbit with aviator goggles and a plunger.I asked if this might attract some sort of federal attention.\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s called buzz. Besides, the pythons started it.\u201dAnd just like that, I found myself wondering how far true it is that behind every successful man stands an even more genius woman.

The particular example I encountered probably isn't what causes the version breakage, but it's certainly a bad indicator.That said, failures in building old software are very often due to one of:* transitive headers (as you mentioned)* typedef changes (`siginfo_t` vs `struct siginfo` comes to mind)* macros with bad names (I was involved in the zlib `ON` drama)* changes in library arrangement (the ncurses/tinfo split comes to mind, libcurl3/4 conditional ABI change, abuse of `dlopen`)Most of these are one-line fixes if you're willing to patch the old code, which significantly increases the range of versions supported and thus reduces the number of artifacts you need to build for bootstrapping all the way to a modern version.\n \nreply",

      "I'd imagine that it's going to end up both getting somewhat better and somewhat worse.2011 is around the time that programmers start taking undefined behavior seriously as an actual bug in their code and not in the compiler, especially as we start to see the birth of tools to better diagnose undefined behavior issues the compilers didn't (yet) take advantage of. There's also a set of major, language-breaking changes to the C and C++ standards that took effect around the time (e.g., C99 introduced inline with different semantics from gcc's extension, which broke a lot of software until gcc finally switched the default from C89 to C11 around 2014). And newer language versions tend to make obsolete hacky workarounds that end up being more brittle because they're taking advantage of unintentional complexity (e.g., constexpr-if removes the need for a decent chunk of template metaprogramming that relied on SFINAE, a concept which is difficult to explain even to knowledgeable C++ programmers). So in general, newer code is likelier to be substantially more compatible with future compilers and future language changes.But on the other hand, we've also seen a greater tend towards libraries with less-well-defined and less stable APIs, which means future software is probably going to have a rougher time with getting all the libraries to play nice with each other if you're trying to work with old versions. Even worse, modern software tends to be a lot more aggressive about dropping compatibility with obsolete systems.

This leads to desperation, which leads to bad behavior.There is a real risk of exploitation, but if it's properly managed, remote work for prisoners is one of the most hopeful things I've heard about the prison system.

      "\"hundreds of thousands to potentially millions of tokens\" - that's the same order as current commercial LLMs.Also note, if the sequence length is not really much larger than the model dimension (at least two orders of magnitude more), the quadratic complexity of the self-attention is really not such a big issue - the matrix multiplication in the feed-forward layers will be usually 8x the model dimension squared, and thus that part will usually dominate.Also note that there has been so much research on this already. While this particular approach might be novel, there has been attempts to avoid the O(n^2) complexity in self-attention basically almost since the original transformer paper came out in 2017. I wonder a bit that this paper does not cite xLSTM, or Block-Recurrent Transformers.Also, this paper comes very short in experiments. There is basically only table 2. There is no study on length extrapolation (which is very relevant for the topic), or needle-in-haystack experiments, or scaling studies, any larger scale experiments, etc. Also, even in this main table 2, I see a couple of typos. And looking at the results in table 2, the improvements seems to be quite minor.So I would conclude, this needs a lot more work.\n \nreply",

There are two bottlenecks at play: compute and memory, and your reasoning applies to compute. In case of memory it gets trickier: for MLP layers you\u2019ll need to read same set of weights for all elements of your batch, while for kv cache for attention elements will be different. That\u2019s why in practice the real length where attention dominates would be closer to model dimension / batch size, rather than just model dimension. And this number isn\u2019t as high anymore.\n \nreply",
      "> Unlike traditional Transformer designs, which suffer from quadratic memory and computation overload due to the nature of the self attention mechanism, our model avoids token to token attention entirely.I skimmed the paper, and unlike transformers they basically can scale much more efficiently with longer context.
