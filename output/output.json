      "Serious question, because I'm not sure how I feel about it... should software with a server-side component that needs to keep working be counted as \"buy once\"? We've seen so many cases of companies going out of business or just deciding that it's no longer worth running these services, and leaving customers with no recourse.An example from this list: LocalCan \u2013 https://buyoncesoftware.com/localcan \u2013 there's a server-side component (which is why ngrok its competitor is subscription based). If this component disappears the app ceases to function.The flip side to this is that just because an app is entirely local doesn't mean it will work as the software around it gets updated (OSes etc), so if a company decides to stop supporting it, that too is useless in a way. It's not the same because running it on the machine you had when you bought it would still work, but that's not how we use computers in practice. Perhaps this is a different case because many of these \"buy once\" would charge for a major update like that anyway.\n \nreply",
      "Steam is just about the only 'DRM' I'm willing to accept in this area.  Both because I suspect there won't be an issue within my lifetime, and that if there IS an issue within my lifetime the outcry will be so huge that anything I wanted to get off of it will have 'alternative work arounds'.  E.G. either at that point Steam allows a close-out download that doesn't have the DRM, or similarly freed versions would exist.For everything else, I prefer free to license and use forever where possible.  Like Linux and LibreOffice.\n \nreply",
      "> The flip side to this is that just because an app is entirely local doesn't mean it will work as the software around it gets updated (OSes etc), so if a company decides to stop supporting it, that too is useless in a way.This used to be less of a problem, when OS vendors gave more of a shit about backward compatibility. But still, even today, this doesn't seem like a major risk. OS platforms really don't change that fast. I would expect a Linux, Mac or Windows app purchased today to actually work unpatched (on a computer with the same CPU architecture) for 10, maybe 20 years. I mean, we have games from the 90s that still can be made to work on a modern Windows machine.The most recent OS-driven rug-pull that broke software that I remember is Apple removing support for 32-bit apps. Which yes was a dick move.The web as a platform is a different story. Browser APIs are all over the place and things get broken constantly. I honestly would not be willing to pay for a browser-based software, full stop. I just feel like web developers in general are way less serious about forward and backward compatibility, and making sure their software works on a browser that isn't \"Bleeding Edge Chrome\".\n \nreply",
      "The server side component aspect is a serious flaw with the directory. Updates, well, that has always been an issue with perpetual licenses and is quite often out of control of the software vendor. Just because the license is perpetual, I don't think it is reasonable to expect perpetual support.\n \nreply",
      "If it depends on a network service that isn't included in the purchase, then it's definitely not a thing you purchasedEdited to add: The OS upgrade example you give is different I think, because- that's under your control: you can choose to keep an old system around, run emulation or WINE, depending on how important this is to you- they don't have ongoing costs, like they do with a service, so there's no reason for them to stop providing the thing you thought you purchased\n \nreply",
      "Yeah I agree the OS upgrade is different, but it is somewhere on a spectrum right?> If it depends on a network service that isn't included in the purchase, then it's definitely not a thing you purchasedNot sure if this is what you're referring to, but there's a distinction between services provided by the software supplier, and services that aren't.Example, could a Twitter client (RIP) be buy-once? Well, yes from the supplier, but no because Twitter turned down their public API access. I think a Twitter client could be sold in the spirit of buy-once.The clearer case though is something like LocalCan, where it depends on a service provided by the supplier, and that could go away, and I think therefore shouldn't be classed as buy-once (although this is not something I'm decided on, hence looking for input here).\n \nreply",
      "To me, anything that needs a server cannot be \"buy once\", because that would imply that  the server availability for forever is included in the purchase. Which obviously is not and neither should it be.You do make a good point that all, even local only software has a \"best before\" date, but online software is different: it has a hard expiry date. It is also prone to gradual price hikes and enshitification.\n \nreply",

      "FridayGPT is also not really open about the need for an API key on their landing page. \nOnly in the FAQ they mention it. \nSeems a bit shady to me.There are also other AI tools listed there.\nhttps://buyoncesoftware.com/?category=AIAs soon as the AI models run on an external server a buy once model does no longer work (or atleast not with an acceptable one time price). \nThe constant server cost is just to high.\n \nreply"

      "I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Rust feels like a Python developer\u2019s idea of a high-performance computing language. It\u2019s a great language for many kinds of applications \u2014 just not when you need to squeeze out every bit of performance from advanced hardware.Even before getting into SIMD, try using Rust for concurrent, succinct, or external-memory data structures. It quickly becomes clear where the friction is.Cargo is fantastic \u2014 clean, ergonomic, and a joy compared to many toolchains. But it\u2019s much easier to keep things simple when you don\u2019t have to support dozens of AVX-512 variants, AMX, SME, different CUDA generations, ROCm, or any of the other modern hardware capabilities.Standardising SIMD in the standard library \u2014 in Rust or C++ \u2014 has always been a questionable idea. Most of these APIs cater to operations that compilers already auto-vectorize reasonably well, and they barely touch the recent capabilities of SIMD. Just consider how hard it is to build any meaningful abstraction over the predicate/register models across AVX-512, SVE, and RVV.RVV aside, this should illustrate the point: https://www.modular.com/blog/understanding-simd-infinite-com...\n \nreply",
      "Seems rustc nightly does successfully vectorize the first sigmoid example: https://rust.godbolt.org/z/e1WYexqWYAlso there's progress on making safe intrinsics safe: https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/pull/1714\n \nreply",
      "Very interesting! I posted a vector and quaternion lib here a few weeks ago, and got great feedback on the state of SIMD on these things. I since have went on a deep dive, and implemented wrapper types in a similar way to this library. Used macros to keep repetition down. Split into three main sections:  - Floating point primitives. Like this lib. Basically, copied `core::simd`'s API. Will delete this part once core::simd is stable. `f32x8`, `f64x4` types etc, with standard operator overloads, and utility methods like `splat`, `to_array` etc.\n\n  - Vec and Quaternion analogs. Same idea, similar API. Vec3x8, Quaternionx8 etc.\n\n  - Code to convert slices of floating point values, or non-SIMD vectors and quaternions to SIMD ones, including (partial) handling of accessing valid lanes in the last chunk.\n\nI've incorporated these `x8` types into a WIP molecular dynamics application; relatively painless after setting up the infra. Would love to try `Vec3x16` etc, but 512-bit types aren't stable yet. But from Github activity on Rust, it sounds like this is right around the corner!Of note, as others pointed out in the thread here I mentioned, the other vector etc libs are using the AoS approach, where a single f32x4 value etc is used to represent a Vec3 etc. While with this SoA approach, a `Vec3x8` is for performing operations on 8 Vec3s at once.The article had interesting and surprising points on AVX-512 (Needed for f32x16, Vec3x16 etc). Not sure of the implications of exposing this in a public library is, i.e. might be a trap if the user isn't on one of the AMD Zen CPUs mentioned.From a few examples, I seem to get 2-4x speedup from using the x8 intrinsics, over scalar (non-SIMD) operations.\n \nreply"

Everyone gets the same artifact, and it always works. No more dicking around with wine settings, because it's baked in for whatever the software is.Yes, this is tremendously space inefficient, so the next step would be a way of slimming wine down for container usage.The only real barrier to this system is licensing and software anti patterns.

      "I use Keynote to make my presentations, and one time I wanted to build a presentation with someone else.  I asked my friend who has worked at Apple for 20 years, \"How do you guys build Keynote presentations together?  There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do that?\".He said, \"We don't collaborate at Apple because of the (perceived) risk of leaks.  None of our tools are built for collaboration\".  Apple is famously closed about information sharing, to the point where on some floors every office requires its own badge, and sometimes even the cabinets within.So it doesn't surprise me that their video editing tools are designed for a single user at a time.Edit:  This happened about six years ago, they have since added some collaboration tools, however it's more about the attitude at Apple in general and why their own tools lag on collaboration.Edit 2:  After the replies I thought I was going crazy.  I actually checked my message history and found the discussion.  I knew this happened pre-COVID, but it was actually in 2013, 12 years ago.  I didn't think it was that long ago.\n \nreply",

      "Didn't the article say some floors require keys for different offices and sometimes filing cabinets.That implies every floor is different which matches what you are saying.Most of the stories that have come out felt like they were the image Apple wanted to give.  It started with Apple going after missing iphone that was left at a bar.  We've heard those working on latest design for the next iphone were sequestered away from the rest of the company.  I've always thought it was marketing spin and I'm glad we have an ex-apple employee confirming this.  Back in the 'Lisa' days Apple did split and silo divisions, Apple did closely guard new iPhone designs with very few leaks happening but the rest of the mythology is more marketing.\n \nreply",
      "Anything Apple gets attention. But any large organization does various forms of segmentation. Many of these stories are \u201ctrue\u201d, but also bullshit.I worked for a company that did some work for the federal government. Boring stuff. Their compliance rules essentially required that we firewall the folks with operational access to their data from the rest of the company. We included the physical offices in that to avoid certain expenses and controls companywide.\n \nreply",

      "> Apple used to have privacy as the differentiating and profit-driving factor.> This will immediately get thrown out of the window when it hurts profitThis is the important thing I'm always trying to note to people that think incentives are enough (as I used to).  You can never know what the incentives of the company will be 5, 10, 15 years from now, or whether that company or division will exist or have been sold to some other company.Incentives based on current conditions only matter for outcomes that don't have ramaifications far into the future. That's definitely not data collection and privacy, where you could find that 10 years worth of collected information about you has been sold at some future date.And lest anyone think they can predict the stance a company will have on a topic a decade or two later, all I can say is that any example someone can point to of \na company that has stayed the course we can easily look at point in history where a series of events could have gone the other way and they would be close to being bought out if not defunct.  Even Apple had a period where they were bailed out by investment from Microsoft, and many other large names of that period were gobbled up.Always keep in mind, Sun was an amazing company with amazing products and engineers that embraced open source and competed with Microsoft in the enterprise market, and eventually after declining they got bought by Oracle.\n \nreply",
      "OpenAI integration in current Apple products needs to be enabled to begin with, and then it still prompts you before sending anything to OpenAI servers, so I'd say it's in line with their practices so far.The reason why I trust Apple a little bit more than, say, Google on something like this is that Apple is pitching their products as luxury goods - a way to be different from the hoi polloi - so they need features to plausibly differentiate along these lines. And privacy is one thing that they know Google will never be able to offer, given its business model, so it makes perfect sense for Apple to double down on that.(Ironically, this means that Apple users benefit from Android being the dominant platform.)\n \nreply",
      "That is kind of proving OPs point, though: the differentiating factor isn\u2019t actual privacy, it\u2019s an impression of privacy that you\u2019re sold; the warm, fuzzy feeling that you\u2019re using a superior product because you\u2019re special and this phone is for special people that have important data that needs to be protected, and as a manufacturer of special people devices, Apple obviously takes care of this\u2014because you\u2019re important, duh!If they can get away with appearing to care about privacy instead of actually doing so, they will. That\u2019s all it takes to look better than Google.\n \nreply",
      "You don't even have to make the argument that Apple is untrustworthy.  The stronger argument is that you can't know what Apple will be like in the future, or even if they will still be independent (which seems far fetched since they're so big) or a division that deals with user data won't get sold off with the data even if it's to a respectable company, because that company may eventually sell if to a slightly less respectable company, and repeat.The risk for PII being utilized nefariously never goes away as long as it exists, so the only same stance is to not allow it to exist in others handle if at all possible.  It's the same reason you don't share your banking credentials with your friends. Sure, you might trust them, but you can't know the future, so why even expose yourself to risk you don't have to?\n \nreply",

Then, as the class was winding up, he joked and said \"just kidding, don't do that... here's how we can do this with a Taylor expansion\", and proceeded to derive the same identity in what felt like 30 seconds.Also, don't forget the Jacobian and gradient aren't the same thing!\n \nreply",
