It is just about the only truly novel thing about them. My mental model for LLMs is increasingly \"improv comedy.\" They are good at riffing on things and making odd connections.

That might not have been existential a couple years ago, but given what we're seeing now with, for instance, Paramount making a rival bid for Warner based solely on their coziness with the current administration, it doesn't feel like the corporate media ecosystem is going to be an even \"squint and you can kind of pretend\" neutral territory for organizing and information dissemination going forward.For all that tools like PeerTube, Mastodon, etc are clunkier and more limited than things like YouTube, Bluesky, etc, I think that argument is increasingly going to be irrelevant to their value - we need to start ensuring our capacity to go from 0-1 on media distribution, not from 10-100 or 100+.reply",

      "\"If you're going to vibe code, why not do it in assembly?\"Many people I've seen have taken existing software and 'ported' it to more performant languages like C, Rust, etc.LLMs are extremely efficient and good at translation.The biggest question is maintainability and legibility. If you want it for your own proprietary software, this can (and probably is, generally) a good pattern if you can get the LLM to nail language specific challenges (e.g. memory allocation in C)However, fewer people can write C code generally, and even fewer can use it to build things like UI's. So you're by definition moving the software away from a collaborative mechanism.The abstraction layers were built for human maintenance. LLMs don't need that.reply",
      "To answer the question literally, vs discuss \"is vibe-coding good\": The more tricky details in a language, the more I've seen LLM-first coding struggle. Rust, for instance, often leads to the model playing whack-a-mole with lifetime or borrow checker issues. It can often get to something that compiles and passes the tests, but the process gives me some pause in terms of \"what am I not checking for that the whack-a-mole may have missed.\"In C, without anything like a borrow checker or such, I'd be very worried about there being subtle pointer safety issues...Now, some of that could be volumes of training data, etc, but Rust is widely discussed these days in the places these models are trained on, so I'm not certain it's a training problem vs a attention-to-detail across files problem. I.e., since LLMs are trained to mimic human language, programming languages that are most procedural-human-language-like (vs having other levels o fmeaning embedded in the syntax too) may exactly be those \"LLM-friendly\" languages.reply",

If you ask PMs about backend requirements, they will dodge you, and if you ask front-end or web developers, they are waiting for you to provide them the API.

YMMV): this is a portfolio site done via a cozy-gaming-style AWSD game where you drive around in a jeep-like thingamabob. There are some cute easter eggs, including a sort of... shrine to each of the socials, which you can run into with your car and knock over (though the links remain clickable, of course!).

      "It feels far too early for a protocol that's barely a year old with so much turbulence to be donated into its own foundation under the LF.Alot of people don't realize this, but the foundations that wrap up to the LF have revenue pipelines that are supported by those foundations events (like Kubecon brings in ALOT of money for the CNCF), courses, certifications, etc. And, by proxy, the projects support those revenue streams for the foundations they're in. The flywheel is _supposed_ to be that companies donate to the foundation, those companies support the projects with engineering resources, they get a booth at the event for marketing, and the LF can ensure the health and well-being of the ecosystem and foundation through technical oversight committees, elections, a service-desk, owning the domains, etc.I don't see how MCP supports that revenue stream nor does it seem like a good idea at this stage: why get a certification for \"Certified MCP Developer\" when the protocol is evolving so quickly and we've yet to figure how OAuth is going to work in a sane manner?Mature projects like Kuberentes becoming the backbone of a foundation, like it did with CNCF, makes alot of sense: it was a relatively proven technology at Google that had alot of practical use cases for the emerging world of \"cloud\" and containers. MCP, at least for me, has not yet proven it's robustness as a mature and stable project: I'd put it into the \"sandbox\" category of projects which are still rapidly evolving and proving their value.

For example, if you multiplied two numbers together and then added a third, they would push the first two numbers, multiply, pop the result, push the result back onto the stack (perhaps clearing the stack? after 40 years I don't remember), push the third number, add, pop the result. For the Mandelbrot loop this was even worse, as it never kept the results of the loop. My assembly kept all the intermediate results on the stack for a 100x speed up.Running this code, the 8087 emitted a high-pitched whine. I could tell when my code was broken and it had gone into an infinite loop by the sound. Which was convenient because, of course, there was no debugger.Thanks for bringing back this memory.reply",
      "The compilers available at the time that the 8087 was commonplace were overall horrible and easily beaten anyway.On the other hand, skilled humans can do very very well with the x87; this 256-byte demo makes use of it excellently: https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=53816reply",
      "Ah, lots of supposedly solid state computer stuff, including CPUs, did that. I, too, used it for debugging. This wasn't very conscious on my part, but if some whine became unusual and constant, it was often a sign of something hanging.As I got older, not only did computers stop doing that, my hearing also got worse (entirely normal for my age, but still), so that's mostly a thing of the past.reply",
      "The sound usually comes from inductors and capacitors in the power supply circuitry, not the ICs themselves as they draw pulses of power in patterns at audible frequencies.

      "You're right, not hosts or processes in that case. I forgot about random part as it's been a while since I looked at it.

Kinda like creating an iterator and zip'ing it with iterator of thing you need IDs for.I've switched to using UUIDv7 tho. It made sense to use ULID before v7, but now ULID only has one thing going on - smaller string representation.

I guess that's to avoid hogging the CPU or emptying the OS entropy pool during high loads.However, that \"optimization\" is a failure mode if you're not aware how ULID internals work. It's easy to shoot yourself in the foot by blindly trusting ULID will always generate a unique ID across threads without blocking your thread. That's a sneaky footgun.> That generally only matters when you create a batch of IDs at onceNo, any web service instance can receive requests at arbitrary times, and sometimes in the same millisecond zone. The probability is proportional to the number of concurrent users and requests.> If your goal is to have global order intact, then neither ULID nor UUIDv7 is going to work for you.Agreed.reply",

Ignoring that this engine will have a fraction of the features of Unity (the likely reason for the FPS number in the first place), it's just a useless benchmark because it's an empty scene. `while (true) {}` will get you the same thing.I'd wish they'd highlight how the engine helps you make a game rather than arbitrary performance numbers on microbenchmarks that don't generalize to a real game project. You can absolutely be faster than Unity, but \"9 times faster than Unity out of the box\" is not a number people should take seriously without the context of where the number comes from.I wish them well though. I'm always interested to see more work in implementing engines in GC languages. I'm personally quite interested to see what can be done in modern GC languages like Go or (modern) C# which provide lots of tools to limit GC pressure.

Language is just syntax. ease of use is everything.I've been wanting to make a game for a long time. I toyed with OpenGL/DirectX at multiple points since the 90s, even going so far as to creating a really cool tech demo/engine that scales with CPU core count. However, those days are in the past. I really want to focus on not writing a ton of graphics and sound code. I really want to focus on the game logic and the game itself.The above is one of the reasons I'm finding it hard to get into Godot, even though I *really* like the project (and wish I could fund it, alas, I'm unemployed, permanently). Unity just happens to be robust enough that I might be able to scrap together a prototype. It has built in things like a terrain editor, tons of educational material, an asset store to get some placeholder assets, etc.I saw a comment mentioning how Warcraft 2 was so awesome because it had a great editor. I saw that and also Starcraft had an amazing editor. Neverwinter Nights also had an amazing editor. We need something like that with a good license to build games. Every engine that even somewhat approaches that area blows up in complexity, has a super restrictive license, or doesn't allow you to build your own executables.RPGMaker actually is pretty decent for 2D games, however the fixed resolution and constant dramatic shifts between versions, previous licensing issues (I haven't looked at their current license), and more make it a no go for a serious commercial game...and it doesn't do 3D.Sorry for the rant. Don't even get me started on how much more complicated the transitions from DX8-DX12 or OpenGL 1.x/2.x -> Anything else have been. ;)reply",

Though yes, even unity has some post processing built in that would affect performance.But, I will always correct the cardinal sin of \"using FPS to measure performance\".

Giving back 4.5 milliseconds doesn't means much if any sense of real work will add it back.reply",

The goal of the engine is to use a modern, easy, systems level programming language, with a focus on simplicity, to create a new kind of game engine.The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at aroun"

      "Posted on December 8, 2025  |  Greg K-HIt\u2019s been almost 2 full years since Linux became a CNA\u2070 (Certificate Numbering Authority) which meant that we (i.e. the kernel.org community) are now responsible for issuing all CVEs for the Linux kernel. During this time, we\u2019ve become one of the largest creators of CVEs by quantity, going from nothing to number 3 in 2024 to number 1 in 2025. Naturally, this has caused some questions about how we are both doing all of this work, and how people can keep track of it.I\u2019ve given a number of talks over the past years about this, starting with the Open Source security podcast right after we became\u00b9 a CNA and then the Kernel Recipes 2024 talk, \u201cCVEs are alive, but do not panic\u201d\u00b2 and then a talk\u00b3 at OSS Hong Kong 2024 about the same topic with updated numbers and later a talk at OSS Japan\u2074 2024 with more info about the same topic and finally for 2024 a talk with more detail\u2075 that I can\u2019t find the online version.In 2025 I did lots of work on the CRA\u2076 so most of my speaking\u2077 over this year has been about that topic , but the CVE assignment work continued on, evolving to meet many of the issues we had in our first year of being a CNA. As that work is not part of the Linux kernel source directly, it\u2019s not all that visable to the normal development process, except for the constant feed on the linux-cve-announce mailing list\u2078 I figured it was time to write down how this is all now working, as well a bunch of background information about how Linux is developed that is relevant for how we do CVE reporting (i.e. almost all non-open-source-groups don\u2019t seem to know how to grasp our versioning scheme.)There is a in-kernel document\u2079 that describes how CVEs can be asked for from the kernel community, as well as a basic summary of how CVEs are automatically asigned. But as we are an open community, it\u2019s good to go into more detail as to how all of us do this work, explaining how our tools have evolved over time and how they work, why some things are the way they are for our releases, as well as document a way that people can track CVE assignments on their own in a format that is, in my opinion, much simpler than attempting to rely on the CVE json format (and don\u2019t get me started on NVD\u2026)So here\u2019s a series of posts going into all of this, hopefully providing more information than you ever wanted to know, which might be useful for other open source projects as they start to run into many of the same issues we have already dealt with (i.e. how to handle reports at scale):    Linux kernel versions, how the Linux kernel releases are\u00b9\u2070 numbered.\n(contents served over SSL, by virtue of YC)0: http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2024/02/13/linux-is-a-cna/1: https://opensourcesecurity.io/2024/02/25/episode-417-linux-k...2: https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2024/cves-are-alive-but-no-not...3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at-uDXbX-184: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KumwRn1BA6s5: https://ossmw2024.sched.com/event/1sLVt/welcome-keynote-50-c...6: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resi...7: https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2025/schedule/the-cra-and-what...8: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/9: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/cve.html10: http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2025/12/09/linux-kernel-versio...reply",

But what if we could harness the creative potential of large language models (LLMs) within an evolutionary framework?OpenEvolve is an open-source evolutionary coding agent that integrates large language models into a quality-diversity search framework for algorithm discovery. Candidate programs are produced via LLM-guided edits (diff-based by default), evaluated with user-defined metrics, and organized using MAP-Elites while an island model with migration supports parallel, diversified exploration. The evaluation pipeline supports cascade staging and an artifact side-channel that feeds execution traces and errors back into subsequent prompts; optional LLM-based feedback can be incorporated into scoring.OpenEvolve has been applied across many domains\u2014here are a few examples: systems optimization, scientific discovery, geospatial algo"
