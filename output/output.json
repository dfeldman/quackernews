      "> I realized I looked at this more from the angle of a hobbiest paying for these coding tools. Someone doing little side projects\u2014not someone in a production setting. I did this because I see a lot of people signing up for $100/mo or $200/mo coding subscriptions for personal projects when they likely don\u2019t need to.Are people really doing that?If that's you, know that you can get a LONG way on the $20/month plans from OpenAI and Anthropic. The OpenAI one in particular is a great deal, because Codex is charged a whole lot lower than Claude.The time to cough up $100 or $200/month is when you've exhausted your $20/month quota and you are frustrated at getting cut off. At that point you should be able to make a responsible decision by yourself.reply",
      "I use local models + openrouter free ones.My monthly spend on ai models is < $1I'm not cheap, just ahead of the curve. With the collapse in inference cost, everything will be this eventuallyAlso I've put in my 30 years of tech learning so I might not need them as much as others. I'll basically do    $ man tool | <how do I do this with the tool>\n\nor even    $ cat source | <find the flags and give me some documentation on how to use this>\n\nThings I used to do intensively I now do lazily.I've even made a IEITYuan/Yuan-embedding-2.0-en database of my manpages with chroma and then I can just ask my local documentation how I do something conceptually, get the man pages, inject them into local qwen context window using my mansnip llm preprocessor, forward the prompt and then get usable real results.In practice it's this:    $ what-man \"some obscure question about nfs\" \n    ...chug chug chug (about 5 seconds)...\n\n    <answer with citations back to the doc pages>\n\nEssentially I'm not asking the models to think, just do NLP and process text. They can do that really reliably.reply",
      "Yes, we are doing that. These tools help make my personal projects come to life, and the money is well worth it. I can hit Claude Code limits within an hour, and there's no way I'm giving OpenAI my money.reply",
      "As a third option, I've found I can do a few hours a day on the $20/mo Google plan. I don't think Gemini is quite as good as Claude for my uses, but it's good enough and you get a lot of tokens for your $20. Make sure to enable the Gemini 3 preview in gemini-cli though (not enabled by default).reply",
      "Me. Currently using Claude Max for personal coding projects. I've been on Claude's $20 plan and would run out of tokens. I don't want to give my money to OpenAI. So far these projects have not returned their value back to me, but I am viewing it as an investment in learning best pratices with these coding tools.reply",
      "Claude's $20 plan should be renamed to \"trial\". Try Opus and you will reach your limit in 10 minutes. With Sonnet, if you aren't clearing the context very often, you'll hit it within a few hours. I'm sympathetic to developers who are using this as their only AI subscription because while I was working on a challenging bug yesterday I reached the limit before it had even diagnosed the problem and had to switch to another coding agent to take over. I understand you can't expect much from a $20 subscription, but the next jump up costing $80 is demotivating.reply",
      "> Try Opus and you will reach your limit in 10 minutes.That hasn't been true with Opus 4.5. I usually hit my limit after an hour of intense sessions.reply",
      "> With Sonnet, if you aren't clearing the context very often, you'll hit it within a few hours.Do you mean that users should start a new chat for every new task, to save tokens?  Thanks.reply",
      "Short answer is yes. Not only is it more token-friendly and potentially lower latency, it also prevents weird context issues like forgetting Rules, compacting your conversation and missing relevant details, etc.reply",
      "the only thing that matters is whether or not you are getting your money\u2019s worth. nothing else matters. if claude is worth $100 or $200 per month to you, it is an easy decision to pay. otherwise stick with $20 or nothingreply"

      "We need more people in this world willing to do their own thing, even if others might find it intimidating or silly. The important thing is to have fun and learn things. Compiler hacking is just as good as any other hobby, even if it's done in good jest.Sometimes, these things become real businesses. Not that this should be the intent of this, but it shows that what some consider silly, others will pay good money for.Example: Cards Against Humanity started as a bit of a gag game between a small group of friends and eventually became something that has pop culture relevance.Example: The founder of FedEx actually wrote a business pitch paper for an overnight shipping company. This paper was given a low grade by his professor. He went on to form this company, which become a success, despite this low grade. I like to think that he did this out of spite, and that Christmas letters to his old professor must've been fun.reply",
      "You can't have paradigm shifts by following the paradigm.How I think of it is we need a distribution of people (shaped like a power law, not a normal).Most people should be in the main body, doing what most people do. They're probably the \"most productive\".Then you have people in the mid tail who innovate but it's incremental and not very novel. They produce frequently (our current research paradigm optimizes for this). But there aren't leaps and bounds. Critically it keeps pushing things forward, refining and improving.But then there's those in the long tail. They fail most of the time and are the \"least productive\". Sometimes never doing anything of note their entire lives. But these are also the people that change the world in much bigger ways. And sometimes those that appeared to do nothing have their value found decades or centuries later.Not everyone needs to be Newton/Leibniz. Not everyone should be. But that kind of work is critical to advancing our knowledge and wealth as a species. The problem is it is often indistinguishable from wasting time. But I'm willing to bet that the work of Newton alone has created more value to all of human civilization than every failed long tail person has cost us.In any investment strategy you benefit from having high risk investments. Most lose you money but the ones that win reward you with much more than you lost. I'm not sure why this is so well known in the investment world but controversial in the research/academic/innovation world.reply",

      "I've recently read the great moral philosopher Alisdair MacIntyre's book \"After Virtue\", and in it he defines a \"practice\" as:> \"any coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human activity through which goods internal to that form of activity are realized in the course of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which are appropriate to, and partially definitive of, that form of activity, with the result that human powers to achieve excellence, and human conceptions of the ends and goods involved, are systematically extended. Tic-tac- toe is not an example of a practice in this sense, nor is throwing a football with skill; but the game of football is, and so is chess. Bricklaying is not a practice; architecture is. Planting turnips is not a practice; farming is. So are the\nenquiries of physics, chemistry and biology, and so is the work of the historian, and so are painting and music. In the ancient and medieval worlds the creation and sustaining of human communities-of households, cities, nations-is generally taken to be a practice in the sense in which I have defined it. Thus the range of practices is wide: arts, sciences, games, politics in the Aristotelian sense, the making and sustaining of family life, all fall under the concept.\"Programming is a practice (especially during the golden era of open source software), with its own \"internal goods\" such as described by this article: the pleasure of optimizing an algorithm, the \"ah-ha\" of finding a great root cause, the beauty of a well-written function, the fun of it.MacIntyre also says that practices can only be incubated and cultivated within \"institutions\" - organizations which specifically exist to protect the development of a practice from the intrusion of external goods, by careful management of external goods. But institutions can become corrupted and degrade the practices within them. And indeed recently programming has been degraded into a simple skill used to obtain external goods, namely wealth and fame, and the institutions where programming tends to be cultivated tend to have deeply corrupted themselves. One can still recognize people in tech companies that fight against this tendency, but it's a remarkable confirmation of his thesis in my opinion.reply",

      "In my experience, curiosity and intelligence are very strongly correlated. There is a real gap between people with the curiosity and ability to explore and learn, and people without. This is often handwaved as \"motivation\" but it's more than just that.In fact, the gap is so large that it can be really hard for a person on one side of it to understand how people on the other side think.reply"

      "> It won't scan cards with AI - you manually enter the barcode, which I think makes it less prone to error.This is a very interesting sentence.I interpret this sentence as saying that manually entering a barcode is less error prone than letting AI do it, that AI would have an unacceptable margin of error (and this is probably an accurate assessment).But you don't need AI to find or read barcodes. Finding and reading barcodes is a reasonably mature technology that has existed long before AI.Barcodes exist as a fast, machine readable data transfer format meant to avoid data entry errors by avoiding manual data entry, and yet you've implemented manual entry in order to avoid errors?Now, if one of the constraints you've put on your implementation is that it work only in the browser and you don't want to have to download a large barcode scanning library to the browser, then it makes sense to implement manual entry. But that has nothing to do with AI.That being said, there are some barcode reading apps that can be used to prompt for a scan from a web page, and you get the barcode payload back. I've used an app called \"bineye\" on Android (source on GitHub) that works like this. This helps avoid error prone manual entry and gets the full barcode payload (many barcodes store/encode more information than the human readable text printed next to them).reply",

      "The problem with \"child abuse\" is that some countries classify drawing things as \"child abuse,\" or \"rape,\" or \"animal abuse.\" (Something I don't agree with.)I mentioned in another thread a few weeks back that I got raided by the British police last February for \"uploading/downloading \"illegal\" anime artwork on one of the (anime) artwork websites we're criminally investigating.\" (Yes, the British police are criminally investigating artwork websites, and I'm still under investigation at the time of writing this.)Even if somehow government were able to catch everybody who abuse children, take photos and upload them to sites on Tor, they can classify anything they like as \"child abuse\" in order to justify survillancing people and restricting further freedoms.What's even sadder is that people don't care about safety. They care about the illusion of safety. As long as people have the illusion that they're being kept safe - the farce known as the Online Safety Bill being a great example - they'll tolerate any injustice.Honestly, I'd recommend downloading software like Signal, Session, VeraCrypt, etc. as well as making a Linux USB stick now (especially since countries like the UK wants Red Star OS levels of snooping) because this is honestly going to get much, much worse...reply",

Then a reworked version that takes those issues into consideration is brought forward and passes. That's the process functioning correctly.What might make sense is something akin to the judicial systems \"dismissal with prejudice\". A way for the vote on a law to fail and arguments to be made to bar similar laws from being resubmitted, at least for a time.

It's still better than an unbounded loop tape, though.We had all these issues back in 2006 when my group was implementing autograd for C++ and, later, a computer algebra system called Axiom.

      "Here is a description of the daily commute by Michael Milken, 1980s junk bond king, as told in \"Predator's Ball\" by Connie Bruck:At 5:30am each weekday in the early 1970s, a bus pulled up to a stop in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and a young man lugging a bag that bulged with papers mounted its steps. He was making the two-hour commute to New York City, where he worked at the investment\u00ad banking firm of Drexel Firestone. The train would have provided a more comfortable and faster ride; but, for those very reasons, it also offered more opportunity to meet other Wall Street acquaintances. They would want to engage in the kind of idle small talk that commuters share to pass the time. The thought must have been intolerable. He did not wish to be rude, but he wanted no interrup\u00adtion.As soon as he had settled into his seat, being sure to take one with an empty one adjacent, he unloaded a mountain of prospectuses and 10ks (annual Securities and Exchange Commission filings) onto the seat next to him. On winter mornings the sky was still pitch black and the light on the bus was too dim for him to be able to read. He wore a leather aviation cap with the earflaps down; he had been bald for years, and although he wore a toupee his head always felt cold on these frosty mornings. Now over his aviation cap he fitted a miner's headlamp -- strapped around the back of his head, with a huge light projecting from his forehead.reply",

One easily underestimates the power of consistency.reply",

      "> For example I expect recycling costs to be significantly worse for the Li-Ion.I think there's a good argument for the opposite.Recycling costs for Li-Ion once we are doing it at scale should be significantly negative. There are valuable materials you get to extract, they aren't in that complex a blend to extract them from, and there's a lot of basically the same blend. The biggest risk in this claim is, I think, the implicit claim that we won't figure out how to extract the same materials from the earth much cheaper in the meantime cratering the end of life value of batteries - but in that event the CO2 battery technology is underwater anyways and the chemical batteries win on not wasting R&D costs.By contrast while there's some value in the steel that goes into building tanks and pumps and so on, the material cost if a much lower fraction of the cost of the device. Most of the cost went into shaping it into those complex shapes. I don't know for sure what the cost breakdown of the CO2 plant looks like but if a lot of the cost is something else it's probably something like concrete or white paint that actually costs money to dispose of.reply",

Doctors nowadays (especially in the US, it seems to be less prevalent elsewhere) seem very quick at prescribing medication.And while I don\u2019t doubt that there are serious physiological conditions that warrant, even necessitate, medicating, my impression is that the first response to \u201cdepression\u201d in general shouldn\u2019t be medication.I\u2019ve been depressed in the past, in my 20s even severely. Clinically, you could say. But in the end, every one of those depressive episodes were because something was not right in my life.Whether I acknowledged it or not, whether I even realized that there was a problem, once I figured the issues out and took the sometimes very painful and exhausting steps to sort them out, the depression faded away.Over time, I\u2019ve become better at introspection to figure out what\u2019s really bugging me, and also in recognizing a budding early depression as warning signs.reply",

The \"Monday morning excitement test\" doesn't account for the hedonic treadmill - even meaningful work becomes mundane once your brain adjusts to it.Also, many people are genuinely burnt out from overwork, not just existential malaise. When you're juggling demanding work, family responsibilities, and barely have time for basic self-care, the problem isn't finding your \"highest purpose\" - it's structural.That said, I agree that meaning matters. But meaning doesn't always come from work. Sometimes the healthiest thing is treating work as necessary fuel for a meaningful life outside of it - relationships, hobbies, community involvement.The \"go into politics\" solution is fascinating though. Zero-sum games as existential fulfillment feels counterintuitive.reply",

      "You get off the hedonic treadmill by getting into something deeper like politics.I do feel like I'm an example of someone who's juggled marriage, kids, startups, etc. where how I finally got a clean source of sustainable energy was having a part of my life to truly chase my highest potential. And to me that's politics, and specifically anticorruption and Positive Politics.Glad that the \"go into politics\" ideas piqued your interest!reply",

This is called the hedonic treadmill.To me, what has helped is developing hobbies and relationships outside of work. We're social animals and need connection with others to feel fulfilled.

Thus, they\u2019re no longer selling simple tools, but rather they are selling us services.Yes, there are good Linux distributions that don\u2019t annoy me, and the BSDs never nag me, but the problem with switching to these platforms is that I still need Microsoft Office and other proprietary software tools that are not available outside \u201cBig Tech.\u201d  There are other matters that make switching away from Windows and macOS challenging, such as hardware support and laptop battery life.reply",

      "Affected customer here, if you're curious on our original NANOG post on the whole situation:Hey NANOG,After receiving a BGPAlerter notification that one of our subnets (23.150.164.0/24) had been hijacked, I checked and noticed the prefix in question was missing RPKI. Assuming I had fat fingered something and butchered the ROA, I logged into ARIN and found that the prefix was missing from our resource list entirely, and had been reallocated to another organization and announced from their network. I created a ticket in ARIN and called immediately.They confirmed that our subnet had been accidentally reallocated to another customer, and that they are currently working on returning it to us. After a couple hours, they told us the other organization will stop announcing the prefix, and WHOIS will be returned shortly.I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s no way to prevent this kind of thing on our side if the RPKI ROA itself is removed along with the allocation? I\u2019m planning on adding checks to look for missing ROAs (in addition to invalid/expiring ones), which I'm guessing would've caught this earlier.Have any of you had anything like this happen with ARIN or another RIR? I\u2019m especially curious what might have happened if we\u2019d only noticed and reached out a few weeks later instead of within a few minutes.reply",

      "I'm not 100% convinced by this post. I'd like to see a more extensive formal eval that demonstrates that structured outputs from different providers reduces the quality of data extraction results.Assuming this holds up, I wonder if a good workaround for this problem - the problem that turning on structured outputs makes errors more likely - would be to do this:1. Prompt the LLM \"extract numbers from this receipt, return data in this JSON format: ...\" - without using the structured output mechanism.2. If the returned JSON does indeed fit the schema then great, you're finished! But if it doesn't...3. Round-trip the response from the previous call through the LLM again, this time with structured outputs configured. This should give you back the higher quality extracted data in the exact format you want.reply",
      "(on of the creators of BAML here) yep! exactly!that workaround we've found works quite well, but the problem is that its not sufficient to just retry in the case of failed schema matches (its both inefficient and also imo incorrect).Take these two scenarios for example:Scenario 1. My system is designed to output receipts, but the user does something malicious and gives me an invoice. during step 2, it fails to fit the schema, but then you try with step 3, and now you have a receipt! Its close, but your business logic is not expecting that. Often when schema alignment fails, its usually because the schema was ambiguous or the input was not valid.Scenario 2. I ask the LLM to produce this schema:    class Person {\n      name string\n      past_jobs string[]\n    }\n\nHowever the person only has ever worked at 1 job. so the LLM outputs: { \"name\": \"Vaibhav\", \"past_jobs\": \"Google\" }. Technically since you know you expect an array, you could just transform the string -> string[].thats the algorithm we created: schema-aligned parsing.\nMore here if you're interested: https://boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsingBenchmark wise, when we tested last, it seems to help on top of every model (especially the smaller ones) https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1esd9xc/beating...Hope this helps with some of the ambiguities in the post :)reply",
      "(author here) To be more specific, here's a benchmark that we ran last year, where we compared schema-aligned parsing against constrained decoding (then called \"Function Calling (Strict)\", the orange \u0192): https://boundaryml.com/blog/sota-function-callingreply",
      "I wonder what it would look if you redid the benchmarks, testing against models that have reasoning effort set to various values. Maybe structured output is only worse if the model isn't allowed to do reasoning first?reply",
      "Isn't it better to put it in an agent loop, with the structured output json just specified as a tool? The function call can then just return a summary of the parsed input. We can add in the system prompt a validation step to ask the llm to verify it has provided inputs correctly. This will allow the llm itself to self reflect and correct if needed.reply",
      "That is more or less what BAML doesreply",
      "I understand this but A) then they should have done it here B) the idea that you can't get CoT x JSON without sacrificing JSON formatting is flat out wrong with ~any 2025 model. (i.e. reasoning models and their APIs specifically enable this)reply",
      "Just a week ago, I rewrote our RAG pipeline to use structured outputs, and the tests showed no significant difference in quality after a few tweaks (under vLLM). What helped was that we have a pipeline where another LLM automatically scores 'question-expected answer' pairs, so what we did was: tweak the schema/prompt => evaluate => tweak again, until we got good results in most cases, just like with free-form prompts.Several issues were found:1. A model may sometimes get stuck generating whitespace at the end forever (the JSON schema allows it), which can lock up the entire vLLM instance. The solution was to use xgrammer, because it has a handy feature that disallows whitespace outside of strings.2. In some cases I had to fiddle with metainformation like minItems/maxItems for arrays, or the model would either hallucinate or refuse to generate anything.3. Inference engines may reorder the fields during generation, which can impact the quality due to the autoregressive nature of LLMs (like, the \"calculation\" field must come before the \"result\" field). Make sure the fields are not reordered.4. Field names must be as descriptive as possible, to guide the model to generate expected data in the expected form. For example, \"durationInMilliseconds\" instead of just \"duration\".Basically, you can't expect a model to give you good results out of the box with structured outputs if the schema is poorly designed or underspecified.reply",

You can see the original version\nof this post here.If you use LLMs, you've probably heard about structured outputs. You might think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread. Unfortunately, structured outputs also often degrade response quality.Specifically, if you use an LLM provider's structured outputs API, you're likely to get a lower quality response than if you use their normal text output API:These are very contentious claims, so let's start with an example: extracting data from a receipt.If I use an LLM to extract the receipt entries, it should be able to tell me that one of the items is (name=\"banana\", quantity=0.46), right?Well, usin"

For years I've built static sites using Ruby-based SSGs and occasionally tried JavaScript alternatives. But there's always been a frustrating disconnect when switching between building Rails apps and creating static sites. Stimulus works differently, Tailwind CSS requires separate configurations and countless other tools from my Rails workflow simply weren't reusable in static site generators (even Ruby-based ones!).Perron (Dutch/French; a platform at a railway station from where passengers can board or disembark trains) bridges this gap elegantly. Rather than being a standalone SSG, Perron is packaged as a gem that runs within your Rails app. This approach gives you the best of both worlds:Perron offers two operating modes to fit your needs:With Perron's convention-over-configuration approach, you can organize content in familiar Rails patterns.
