The entire book was published at once with no history, no evidence of the improvement and iteration it takes to create quality work, and no reference as to the creative process or collaborators or anything. And on top of that, the author does not seem to really have any other presence or history in the community. I love Zig, and have wanted more quality learning materials to exist.

But they are not that, and they are not speaking or writing - they are doing what we have decided to call \"generating\" or \"predicting tokens\" but we could just as easily have invented a new word for.For the same reason that human societies should feel free to ban bots from social media - because LLMs have no human right to attention and influence in the public square - there is nothing about placing guardrails on LLMs that contradicts Western values of human free expression.reply",

      "So I don't disagree with any of the criticisms of MCPs but no one here has mentioned why they are useful, and I'm not sure that everyone is aware that MCP is actually just a wrapper over existing cli/API:1.  Claude Code is aware of what MCPs it has access to at all times.2.  Adding an MCP is like adding to the agent's actuators/vocabulary/tools because unlike cli tools or APIs you don't have to constantly remind it what MCPs it has available and \"hey you have access to X\" and \"hey make an MCP for X\" take the same level of effort on the part of the user.3. This effect is _significantly_ stronger than putting info about available API/cli into CLAUDE.md.4. You can almost trivially create an MCP that does X by asking the agent to create an MCP that does X. This saves you from having to constantly remind an agent it can do X.NOTE: I cannot stress enough that this property of MCPs is COMPLETELY ORTHOGONAL to the nutty way they are implemented, and I am IN NO WAY defending the implementation. But currently we are talking past the primary value prop.I would personally prefer some other method but having a way to make agents extensible is extremely useful.EXAMPLE:\"Make a bash script that does X.\"<test manually to make sure it works>\"Now make an MCP called Xtool that uses X.\"<restart claude><claude is now aware it can do\nXtool>reply",
      "Also not disagreeing with your argument. Just want to point out that you can achieve the same by putting minimal info about your CLI tools in your global or project specific CLAUDE.md.The only downside here is that it's more work than `claude mcp add x -- npx x@latest`. But you get composability in return, as well as the intermediate tool outputs not having to pass through the model's context.reply",
      "1.) Awareness doesn\u2019t mean they will use it. And in practice they often don\u2019t use them.2.) \u201c unlike cli tools or APIs you don't have to constantly remind it what MCPs it has available\u201d \n- this doesn\u2019t match my experience. In fact, bash commands are substantially more discoverable.3.) Again, this doesn\u2019t match my experience and the major providers recommend including available MCP tools in system prompts/CLAUDE.md/whatever.4.) Can\u2019t speak to this as it\u2019s not part of my workflow for the previous reasons.The only useful MCP for me is Playwright for front end work.reply",
      "Chrome Devtools is similarly an extremely high value MCP for me.I would agree that if you don't find they add discoverability then MCPs would have no value for you and be worse than cli tools. It sounds like we have had very opposite experiences here.reply",
      "Interesting. Perhaps it comes down to which platforms we're working on. I don't want to be outright dismissive of it. My primary platform is Claude Code. Are you working with another driver e.g. OpenAI Codex?reply",
      "MCP was a really shitty attempt at building a plugin framework that was vague enough to lure people into and then allow other companies to build plugin platforms to take care of the MCP non-sense.\"What is MCP, what does it bring to the table? Who knows. What does it do? The LLM stuff! Pay us $10 a month thanks!\"LLM's have function / tool calling built into them. No major models have any direct knowledge of MCP.Not only do you not need MCP, but you should actively avoid using it.Stick with tried and proven API standards that are actually observable and secure and let your models/agents directly interact with those API endpoints.reply",
      "probably easier to just tell people: You want MCP? Add a \"description\" field to your rest API that describes how to call it.That's all it's doing. Just plain ole context pollution. World could be better served by continuing to build out the APIs that exist.reply",
      "Also, keep your api small as all the tool call, DTOs and user messages (e.g. workflow recipes) add up to big context windows and accuracy confusion, at least in the latest models.  I hope that gets resolved.reply",
      "yesss, and OpenAI tried this first when they were going to do a \u201cGPT store\u201d. But REST APIs tend to be complicated because they\u2019re supporting apps. MCP, when it works, is very simple functionsin practice it seems like command line tools work better than either of those approachesreply",

I previously did some very light benchmarking to see if Bash tools or MCP servers are better suited for a specific task.

They need to cover all bases, which means they provide large numbers of tools with lengthy descriptions, consuming significant context.It's also hard to extend an existing MCP server. You could check out the source and modify it, but then you'd have to understand the codebase, together with your agent.MCP servers also aren't composable. Results returned by an MCP server have to go through the agent's context to be persisted to disk or combined with other results.I'm a simple boy, so I like simple things.

      "\"Hare Brain Tortoise Mind\" is a great book that goes into how this works and how to work with/against it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB_4YU6UtCwtldr: There is a background, non-verbal process in your brain that has the advantage of a larger working set size than your foreground verbal thinking. It is able to observe and consider more stuff at once and find associations better than your conscious thought process.But, it has several disadvantages. It takes time to do its processing. You can't will it into action. It communicates non-verbally with your foreground process. It doesn't work under pressure (thus the need for relaxed, unfocused time). The non-verbal understanding is difficult to deconstruct, generalize and reapply. It can lead to you solving a problem, not understanding how and not being able to solve a variant of the same problem.So, the general recommendation is: If you have a complex problem to solve, first absorb as much information about the problem as your brain can hold. But, do not try to solve anything. Then, go take a break. A walk in a natural environment is preferable. Don\u2019t think about the problem. Relax in a low stress environment.

The video description contains additional links.---\"Dark Patterns: Are Your Games Playing You?\" - https://youtu.be/OCkO8mNK3Ggreply",

      "You absolutely need to spend money in PoE to buy stash tabs. It's basically mandatory if you play regularly. The difference to most dark patterns is that the spending has a very low cap. Once you've spent $50 or so on stash tabs you are set forever and never need to spend again. So it's not so different from buying a $50 game, just that you get to try it out for free first.reply",
      "Did you ever get to endgame? I cant imagine playing without stash tabsreply",
      "There is pretty heavy pressure to buy stash tabs once you hit the later parts of the game, but you get a LOT of time to figure out if you actually like the game before you feel it.reply",
      "You say that, but some of the games that people point at as having harmful monetization have basically the same system of only selling cosmetic items that don't give you an advantage (e.g. Fortnite). And PoE's stash tabs straddle that line a bit.As far as I can tell the main difference is a younger demographic and being more pop culture adjacent. I don't think that should affect whether you consider it \"bad\" monetization, but I will concede that context is important with these sort of things.reply",
      "Overall it feels like unless your game is a linear single-player game, it will fall under multiple of the site's labelled 'dark patterns'. Here are some really bad ones:Infinite Treadmill - Impossible to win or complete the game.Variable Rewards - Unpredictable or random rewards are more addictive than a predictable schedule.Can't Pause or Save - The game does not allow you to stop playing whenever you want.Grinding - Being required to perform repetitive and tedious tasks to advance.Competition - The game makes you compete against other players.reply",
      "I encourage everyone to read the definition on the home page:> Definition: A gaming dark pattern is something that is deliberately added to a game to cause an unwanted negative experience for the player with a positive outcome for the game developer.And also the detailed descriptions of each of the dark patterns, for example:https://www.darkpattern.games/pattern/12/grinding.htmlQuoting just the short descriptions of the dark patterns without considering the definition above is effectively mischaracterizing the intent of the website and not using the tool as intended, and all the patterns seem like they can be/are just enjoyable mechanics to many.Some of the users reviewing games on the website seem to also miss the point (inaccurate reviews), which leads to comments like https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45947761#45948330.It is increasingly often the case in predatory games that a very subtle combination of the mechanics listed make them dark patterns collectively, so it's also important to consider the patterns in groups.reply",

      "One thing that makes Cloudflare worse for home usage is it acts as a termination point for TLS, whereas Tailscale does not. If you use a Tailscale Funnel, you get the TLS certificate on your endpoint. With Cloudflare, they get a TLS certificate for you, and then strip and optionally re-add TLS as traffic passes through them.I actually have no idea how private networks with WARP are here, but that's a pretty big privacy downgrade for tunneling from the Internet.I also consider P2P with relay fallback to be highly desirable over always relaying traffic through a third party, too. Firstly, less middlemen. Secondly, it continues working even if the coordination service is unavailable.reply",

It isn't always obvious, even though some of the features pretty much require it (at least to be handled entirely on Cloudflare's side.

Maybe Tailscale will support some of those as features of the `serve` server?)> client-less accessJFYI, Tailscale Funnels also work for this, though depending on your use case it may not be ideal.

Is curing patients a bad business model? Sure, for the biotech company it is, but those cured patients are far more likely to go on living longer, healthier lives, and in turn contribute additional value to society - which will impact others in ways that may also create additional value.  That doesn't even get into the jobs and value created through the R&D process, testing, manufacturing, logistics of delivery, ongoing monitoring, etc.  As long as the value created is more than the cost of the treatment, then it's a net-gain for the economy even if it's a net loss for that singular business.If all you're judging is the first-order impacts on a single business, you're missing the forest for the trees.reply",

If you are mocking anything in the standard library your code is probably structured poorly.In the example the author walks through, a cleaner way would be to have the second function take the Options as a parameter and decouple those two functions. You can then test both in isolation.reply",
      "Details matters, but good test doubles here are important.  You want to capture all calls to IO and do something different. You don't want tests to break because someone has a different filesystem, didn't set their home directory as you want it setup, or worse is trying to run two different tests at the same time and the other test is changing files the other wants.Note that I said test doubles.  Mocks are a bit over specific - they are about verifying functions are called at the right time with the right arguments, but the easy ability to set return values makes it easy to abuse them for other things (this abuse is good, but it is still abuse of the intent).In this case you want a fake: a smart service that when you are in a test setups a temporary directory tree that contains all the files you need in the state that particular test needs, and destroys that when the test is done (with an optional mode to keep it - useful if a test fails to see debug).  Depending on your situation you may need something for network services, time, or other such things. Note that in most cases a filesystem itself is more than fast enough to use in tests, but you need isolation from other tests.  There are a number of ways to create this fake, it could override open, or it could just be a GetMyProgramDir function that you override are two that I can think of.reply",
      "Arguably this is a problem in when the patch is unapplied.Presumably in the coverage case it\u2019s being called by a trace function, which inevitably runs during test execution \u2014 and while we want the trace function to be called during the test function, we really want it without any patches the test function is using. But this arguably requires both an ability for the trace function to opt-out of patches and for the patcher to provide a way to temporarily disable all of them.reply",
      "Why even mock anything in this example? You need to read the source code to work out what to mock, reaching deep inside the code to name some method to mock.But what if you just passed in the contents of the file or something?Edit: oh wait actually this is what the very last line in the blog post says! But I think it should be emphasized more!reply",
      "It is worth pointing out that you can often use containerized services as an alternative to mocking.reply",
      "I feel like the #1 reason mocks break looks nothing like this and instead looks like: you change the internal behaviors of a function/method and now the mocks interact differently with the underlying code, forcing you to change the mocks. Which highlights how awful mocking as a concept is; it is of truly limited usefulness for anything but the most brittle of tests.Don't test the wrong things; if you care about some precondition, that should be an input. If you need to measure a side effect, that should be an output. Don't tweak global state to do your testing.reply",
      "Most of the real world is about manipulating the real world.  For algorithms it is fine to say depend on the pure inputs/outputs.  However what we care about is that global state is manipulated correctly and so the integration tests that verify that are what are important.  In most cases your algorithm shouldn't be unit tested separately since it is only used in one place and changes when the users change: there is no point in extra tests. If  the algorithm is used in many places comprehensive unit tests are important, but they get in the way when the algorithm is used only once and so the tests just inhibit changes to the algorithm as requirements change (you have to change the user, the integration tests, and the unit tests that are redundant).As such I disagree. Global state is what you should be testing - but you need to be smart about it.  How you setup and verify global state matters.   Don't confuse global state above with global state of variables, I mean the external state of the program before and after, which means network, file, time, and other IO things.reply"

      "I really don't get the point the article is making. I think the whole point about curve fitting is really a distraction, they could have simply stated that the FFT has periodic boundary conditions, so if you take the FFT of something that only extends a finite time of your sampling window, you will see your delta functions in the frequency domain spaced by the inverse of the length of your sampling window, i.e. the FFT \"sees\" your finite window as a pulse train. That's well known and a fundamental aspect of Fourier transforms.But then the statements about the discontinuous \"vibrations\". E.g. in the case of the 1 Hz cycle over half the window the author states that:> Yet the FFT of this data is also very complex. Again, there are many harmonics with energy. They indicate that the signal contains vibrations at 0.5Hz, 1.0Hz, 1.5Hz, etc. But the time signal clearly shows that the 'vibration' was only at 1Hz, and only for the first second.The implication that there is a vibration only at 1Hz is plain wrong. To have a vibration abruptly stop, you need many frequencies (in general the shorter a feature in the time domain the more frequency components you need in the frequency domain). If we compare for example a sine wave with a square wave at the same frequency, the square wave will have many more frequency components in the Fourier domain (it's a sinc envelope of delta functions spaced at the frequency of the wave in fact). That's essentially what is done in the example the sine wave is multiplied by a square wave with half the frequency (similar things apply to the other examples). Saying only the fundamental frequency matters is just wrong.This is also not just a \"feature of the fitting to sines\", it's fundamental and has real world implications. The reason why we e.g. see ringing on an oscilloscope trace of a square wave input is because the underlying analog system has a finite bandwidth, so we \"cut-off\"/attenuate higher frequency components, so the square wave does not have enough of those higher frequencies (which are irrelevant according to the author) to represent the full square wave.reply",
      "> FFT has periodic boundary conditionsFFT is simply an algorithm to efficiently compute the DFT. The fact that the article makes no mention of DFT vs fourier series vs DTFT is going to end up creating more confusion that it solves. For some reason introductory tutorials always start with the DFT (usually mistakenly using FFT and DFT interchangeably), even though to me the continuous fourier transform is far easier to conceptually understand. Going from continuous fourier transform to the DTFT, is just applying the FT to a dirac-combed (sampled) function. Then from DTFT to DFT you introduce periodic boundary condition. Fourier series is just applying FT to a function that happens to already be periodic, resulting in a finite set of discrete frequencies.There is a connection between fourier series and DFT in that if the fourier series is computed for the periodic resummation of a signal, and then the DFT is computed for the original signal (which implicitly involves applying a periodic boundary condition), the DFT is just the periodic resummation of the fourier series.I spent ages meditating on this image https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform?#/m... before everything finally clicked, it's a shame that introductions never once mention DTFTreply",
      "Completely agree the transition between continuous and discrete domains is often glossed over and people use DFT, FT, DTFT and FFT almost interchangeably (I certainly have been guilty of that myself, and you are correct the FFT and DFT are equivalent for this discussion).An interesting fact (somewhat related to your mentioning of the DTFT) is that one can consider the DFT as a filter with a sinc transfer function. That's essentially how you can understand the spectrum of an OFDM signal. You perform a block based FFT on your input bit/symbol stream, so you have waves at different carriers. However, because the stream is timevarying you essentially get sinc shaped spectra spaced at the symbol rate (excluding cycling prefixes etc.). So your OFDM spectrum is composed of many sincs spaced at fb, which is very squarish which is one of the reasons why OFDM is so advantageous.reply",
      "I generally agree with the point of the article (\"Fourier transform is not magical\").However saying it is \"just\" curve fitting with sinusoids fails to mention that, among an infinite number of basis functions, there are some with useful properties, and sinusoids are one such:  they are eigenvectors of shift-invariant linear systems (and hence are also eigenvectors of derivative operators).reply",
      "This gets brought up quite often here but something people don't talk about is why Fourier needed to do this. Historical context is really fun! In the late 1800s, Fourier wanted to mathematically describe how heat diffuses through solids, aiming to predict how temperature changes over time, such as in a heated metal rod. Observing that temperature variations evolve smoothly, he drew inspiration from the vibrating string problem studied by Euler and D\u2019Alembert, where any complex motion could be expressed as a sum of simple sine waves. Fourier hypothesized that heat distribution might follow a similar principle; that any initial temperature pattern could be decomposed into basic sinusoidal modes, each evolving independently as heat diffused.reply",
      "Minor correction, Fourier made his breakthroughs in the early 1800's. He worked under the reign of Napoleon and continued in the decade thereafter.reply",
      "And it is an important correction because Fourier was immediately able to use his technique to solve partial differential equations, but it was many decades later before it was shown how it all works with the rigorous foundation of measure theory and functional analysis.reply",
      "This feels like a very indirect way of saying \"yes the fourier transform of a signal is a breakdown of its component frequencies, but depending on the kind of signal you are trying to characterize for it might not be what you actually need.\"Its not that unintuitive to imagine that if all of your signals are pulses, something like the wavelet transform might do a better job at giving you meaningful insights into a signal than the fourier transform might.reply",
      "It's not just curve fitting because basis functions have characteristics which make them desirable for the kind of decomposition one is trying to find. We typically assume in factor analysis that factors are gaussian random variables without clear and repeating patterns. Fourrier transforms force us to think in similar terms but accounting for specific dynamics factor (I. E. Basis functions) should capture.Also how do we construct those orthogonal basis functions for any downstream task is an interesting research question!reply",
      "All quite good examples but I would say that these are quite well known. It\u2019s also missing that there are mitigation strategies for some - for e.g. in vibration analysis it\u2019s typical to look at the Hann windowed data to remove the effect of partial cycles, and it\u2019s common to overlap samples too. Similarly there are other tools like the Cepstrum which help you identify periodic peaks in the spectral data.reply"
