      "3.0 is big for GIMP. Lots of features to make it viable for simple Desktop Publishing and YouTube thumbs.Created a quick poster: https://i.imgur.com/pPgy255.png Stuff that needs work:* UI/UX:  \"Tool->GEGL Operation...\" is too much friction for such a common operation- just pop it up when you click on the \"FX\" button in the layers window.* UI/UX:  Naming. Drop shadows and glow are currently not discoverable (its squirreled away in the generic \"GEGL Styles\").* UI/UX: \"Move Tool\" should act like a common entry point to other tools if you're not dragging. Switch to \"Transform Tool\" if I single click an image layer. Switch to the \"Text Tool\" if I single click a Text layer! Please!* UI/UX: Copying/pasting layer styles does not work. Users can overlook many issues if you can duplicate/destroy layer styles easily. Preset system is cumbersome. Idea: Presets usable from the Layers window directly (could be just add/apply presets) would help a lot, but just copy/paste would probably be better.* BUG: Layers often clip GEGL Glow. Again could be worked around by just easy copy/paste of layer styles. See clipping present on \"GIMP Halloween Party\" text in my image.\n \nreply",

      "Think of it like a book cover. Regardless of a book's title or summary, an attractive (attracting? attention grabbing?) cover will get more people to click it. Also depending on where the thumbnail is displayed, you may not see the full video title, such as the grid after a video finishes playing.\n \nreply",

      "At the end of a video, youtube shows thumbnails for several \"suggested next videos\".The thumbnail, video name and channel name are the only bits of information potential viewers see - if your thumbnail isn't good, they aren't even going to _start_ your video, let alone keep watching it.\n \nreply",
      "Though I haven't seen stats to back it up - I've heard from multiple sources that thumbnails which include a gigantic bobblehead of the author with a particularly exaggerated stupid looking expression on their face induce more people to click through.Even if it's for the sake of feeding the algorithm, I do my best to skip them.I also internally prioritize videos which:- avoid usage of superlatives \"TOP X\", \"BEST OF Y\"- have more than 5k views and less than 250k views.After a while, my YT recommendations have become mostly solid.\n \nreply",

      "> Making pro-quality text got easier, too. Style your text, apply outlines, shadows, bevels, and more, and you can still edit your text, change font and size, and even tweak the style settings.This is a game-changer. I tried to use GIMP to typeset comic translations many years ago, and the workflow was so terrible I had to resort to a few extra tools, complicating my workflow. I'll have to try the new text editing to see for sure, but it sounds like typesetting is now comparable to what's offered in proprietary editors.\n \nreply"

      "I once worked in a design research lab for a famous company. There was a fairly senior, respected guy there who was determined to kill the keyboard as an input mechanism.I was there for about a decade and every year he'd have some new take on how he'd take down the keyboard. I eventually heard every argument and strategy against the keyboard you can come up with - the QWERTY layout is over a century old, surely we can do better now. We have touchscreens/voice input/etc., surely we can do better now. Keyboards lead to RSI, surely we can come up with input mechanisms that don't cause RSI. If we design an input mechanism that works really well for children, then they'll grow up not wanting to use keyboards, and that's how we kill the keyboard. Etc etc.Every time his team would come up with some wacky input demos that were certainly interesting from an academic HCI point of view, and were theoretically so much better than a keyboard on a key dimension or two... but when you actually used them, they sucked way more than a keyboard.My takeaway from that as an interface designer is that you have to be descriptivist, not prescriptivist, when it comes to interfaces. If people are using something, it's usually not because they're idiots who don't know any better or who haven't seen the Truth, it's because it works for them.I think the keyboard is here to stay, just as touchscreens are here to stay and yes, even voice input is here to stay. People do lots of different things with computers, it makes sense that we'd have all these different modalities to do these things. Pro video editors want keyboard shortcuts, not voice commands. Illustrators want to draw on touch screens with styluses, not a mouse. People rushing on their way to work with a kid in tow want to quickly dictate a voice message, not type.The last thing I'll add is that it's also super important, when you're designing interfaces, to actually design prototypes people can try and use to do things. I've encountered way too many \"interface designers\" in my career who are actually video editors (whether they realize it or not). They'll come up with really slick demo videos that look super cool, but make no sense as an interface because \"looking cool in video form\" and \"being a good interface to use\" are just 2 completely different things. This is why all those scifi movies and video commercials should not be used as starting points for interface design.\n \nreply",
      "I know that most developers prefer keyboard shortcuts when developing software but I prefer using the mouse mostly because I cannot remember all of the shortcuts in a range of different environments.Given my preference it would be interesting to explore a more tactile interface.  - a series of physical knobs to skip back and forward by function, variable reference, etc\n  - a separate touch screen with haptic feedback for common functions and jump to predefined functions in my code\n  - a macro-pad with real buttons to do the above\n\n\nOther thoughtsWhen watching videos physical buttons and knobs would be good.\nI know professional video and audio engineers already use these technologies but i've never tried them myself.\n \nreply",
      "> I prefer using the mouse mostly because I cannot remember all of the shortcuts in a range of different environments.This is why one of the greatest changes in power user tooling in recent years is the \"find anywhere\" hotkey, which is now available almost everywhere.Mouse interaction is slow and hardly a panacea for finding features buried in menus. \"Find anywhere\" type interactions with fuzzy search allow you to use they keyboard and highly mnemonic abbreviations to turn up what you're looking for. With a few exceptions, I tend to lean on them even for things that I use regularly, because it's easier to learn which few keystrokes will turn up the option I'm looking for than it is to rebind a fresh hotkey in each environment or, as you say, memorize the built-in one.\n \nreply",
      "> \"find anywhere\" hotkey, which is now available almost everywhereAlmost everywhere? I'd love to see a list of other examples.The only place I can name is the vscode Ctrl-Shift-P thing, and in that case it's a wholesale replacement for an explorable/discoverable UI (i.e. traditional menu bar).Sure there are search boxes in other places, but usually that's literally for finding things, not for performing application domain commands/actions/manipulations, which is what I understood the parent to be describing.\n \nreply",

      "It's kinda mind-blowing that we have (so-called) AI, quantum computing, 6K screens, M2 NVME, billions of networked devices, etc., but regular data *can only be expected to last about 5 years* due to the propensity of moving disk failure, SSD impermanence, bitrot, etc., and is only overcome with great attention and significant cost (continually maintaining a JBOD or RAID or NAS, or painstakingly burning to M-Disc bluray etc.) or handing it over to someone else to manage (cloud) or both.  I mean maybe you get lucky with a simple 3-2-1 but maybe you don't, and for larger archives of data that is simply not necessarily a walk in the park either.Absolutely mindblowing.\n \nreply",
      "Emphatic Yes.I'd like to expand. What I find mindblowing about it is that, as a regular consumer:* When you need more space you can't just plug in another disk or USB stick. You also have to choose on which device you want to use it, and you have to tell all your software to use it. And that may involve shuffling data around.* As a corollary, you need to remember in which device you put which stuff.* As an extra corollary, any data loss is catastrophic by default.* File copy operations still fail, and when they fail, they do so without ACID-strong commit/fallback semantics.* Backups don't happen by default, and are not transparent to the end user.* Data corruption can be silent.Bonus, but related:* You can't share arbitrary files with people without going through a 3rd party.\n \nreply",
      "This is because most of the non-technical retail customers don't value reliability too much. They want more capacity and good speed at the lowest price point. Hence the proliferation of QLC / MLC NVMe drives with a small SLC write cache. It's not very stable, and it can only keep the write speed high for small files, but hey, you can get a terabyte for $50, and it loads the latest game real fast!Similarly, many users don't have much valuable, unique data on their computers. The most important stuff very often lives completely in the cloud, where it's properly backed up, etc.Also, the most ubiquitous computing device now is a smartphone. It has all the automatic backup stuff built in, you can put an SD card into it, and it will transparently extend the free space, without hassle. Even on PCs, MS and Apple nudge the users very prominently to use OneDrive and Apple Cloud for backing up their desktops / laptops. But past certain size, it costs money though, hence many people opt out of that. Again, because most people value the lowest price, and just hope for the best; because what could ever happen?Silent data corruption can still be an issue, but, frankly, malware is a much bigger threat for a typical non-technical user.Technical people have no trouble setting up all that: mount your disks under LVM, run ZFS on top of it, set up multiple backups, set up their own \"magic wormhole\" to share files with stranger easily. But they know why they are doing that.Educating users about IT hygiene is key for improving it, much like educating people about the dangers of not washing hands, or of eating unhealthy stuff, helped improve their health.\n \nreply",

People definitely do value their data \u2013 data recovery services have been getting revenue for decades from people who lost things they care about \u2013 but there\u2019s been a market failure where operating system vendors left the users to fend for themselves, everyone agreed that was hard, and the majority of users quite rationally decided that cloud services were better than learning to be unpaid sysadmins.What we should be asking is why this is all so hard. Local file systems with strong integrity checks and seamless replication onto attached storage should be so basic that people can just assume it\u2019ll work without them having to spend time on it.\n \nreply",
      "> Local file systems with strong integrity checks and seamless replication onto attached storage should be so basic that people can just assume it\u2019ll work without them having to spend time on it.What you're asking for is basically a bug-free btrfs plus a bit of automation on top (unless you also want a smart caching layer, which we already know is a Hard Problem). That automation is simple enough that it would definitely exist by now if there was a bug-free btrfs for it to manage. But that turns out to be a hard problem, so anyone who wants to run their system with automatic add and remove and rebalance is looking for trouble. (ZFS has a better reputation on the reliability front, but is too inflexible for a consumer-grade pooling of arbitrary storage devices.)\n \nreply",
      "Right - when I heard the ZFS announcement at Usenix I assumed it\u2019d become standard a decade later when consumer hardware could handle the extra work, but it seems to have been sandbagged by the rise of cloud storage and the switch to SSDs reducing the frequency where people get corrupted data instead of all-or-nothing failures.Apple claims that their hardware makes it unnecessary for APFS but I\u2019m skeptical and the last time I looked the Time Machine situation was still pretty clunky.

The two problems with this are that any time I zoom in or out I now have to double check the color key in case it's changed, and if I want to find a travel time for something far away I need to zoom in to find the destination and then back out to see the travel time. Perhaps you can let the user manually choose the colormap granularity/range, or find some way to have a colormap that works at all scales?Second suggestion, related, is to display the travel time next to the geography ID in the bottom left corner.

      "> Now, all of this might have been fine had Beyond Trust not written a feature which allowed users to directly, programmatically interact with psql (the postgres command line interface).That's the buried lede.Yes, there was a vulnerability in psql... but that's so much less a problem than the huge gaping hole of allowing users to directly interact with psql.No DB can be safe if you are turning untrusted user commands into psql executions.  It'd be like giving untrusted users ssh access and then complaining when they find a privilege elevation exploit.\n \nreply",
      "The only reason BeyondTrust implemented that was it wasn't untrusted user commands. They sanitized the data, so it should have been fine. The unfortunate problem was that the sanitizer didn't sanitize.Systems are built on a set of expectations. Undermine the expectations and you undermine the system.\n \nreply",
      "> They sanitized the data, so it should have been fine.This is a 101 rookie level approach to SQL or injection defense.It's dumb for exactly the same reason why this is dumb    \"SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=\" + sanitize(userInput)\n\nThe correct way to do something like this will always be parameterized input which looks something like this    \"SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=?\"\n    bindParameter(1, userInput);\n\nWhy? Because that the postgres protocol splits out the command and the data for the command in a way that can't be injected.  Something that should be viewed as impossible to do when data and command are merged into 1 String.IF this company wanted to build dynamic queries, then the only correct way to do that is to limit input to only valid variables.  IE \"isValidColumnName(userInput)\" before sending the request.  And even then, you'd not use psql to do that.You simply can't use a generalized sanitizer and expect good results.\n \nreply",
      "His argument is that you are building on the assumption that this is safe:    \"SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=?\"\n    bindParameter(1, userInput);\n\nBut what happens when it turns out that isn't safe?\n \nreply",
      "Then you, or someone else, fix the underlying library.This being Postgres, that process was likely completed decades ago.Anticipating the next question, \"but what if it is still unsafe?\", the answer is that there is no fundamental reason why this can't be safe code. Security exploits like this require a cooperation between the receiving code and the incoming data, and it is in fact perfectly possible for the receiving code to be completely safe. There is no such thing as data just so amazingly hackerish that it can blast through all protections. There has to be a hole, and this is among the best-tested and most scrutinized code paths in the world.\n \nreply",
      "That is not what's happening.  You can't bind parameters in psql.What beyond trust did was in fact what I said, constructing the entire query as one string and sending that on to psql.  The sanitization method failed, but that's not what you should use anyways when dealing with user input.If you are using a postgres client, then the message breakdown to postgres when you bind looks something like this (not the actual message stream format, just the jist of what it ends up looking like)    SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar=$1\n    BIND 1 escape(userInput)\n    ENDBIND\n\nThere isn't the same opportunity to create malformed data that can cause an injection attack in the Postgres message stream.  There are far fewer things that need to be escaped in order to put in the full message.  (I skimmed through the protocol, one improvement I'd make to it is adding a length to the bind instead of having a termination like it appears to do. That would, however, preclude streaming data)These yahoos took a different route to running a command than what everyone does and should do and they were bit by it.EDIT  Actually, yes you can bind parameters with psql.  However, it's there mostly as a way to test postgres and not something users are expected to use.\n \nreply",
      "Let's be clear: Beyond Trust is not a company that wrote a database-backed web app and made the all-too-common mistake of writing insecure code that tickled a bug in the database that allowed privilege escalation. Beyond Trust's is a company whose entire contribution is adding a security layer to prevent privilege escalation, and their solution here was to bypass Postgres's standard functionality and use this weird `psql` hack instead.They had one job, and they failed at it. This amateur-level mistake should sink the entire company.\n \nreply",

What's going on?IT administrators and DevOps engineers such as myself typically terminate HTTP/3 connections at the load balancer, terminate SSL, then pass back HTTP 1.1 (_maybe_ 2 if the service is GRPC or GraphQL) to the backing service. This is way easier to administer and debug, and is supported by most reverse proxies. As such, there's not much need for HTTP/3 in server side languages like Golang and Python, as HTTP/1.1 is almost always available (and faster and easier to debug!) in the datacenter anyways.HTTP/3 and IPv6 are mobile centric technologies that are not well suited for the datacenter.

      ">They\u2019re offering what are dubbed private rooms, gated venues that take the core benefit of a dark pool \u2014 the ability to hide big equity deals so they won't impact prices \u2014 and add exclusivity, specifying exactly who can partake in any trade.I'm not sure what all the consternation is about. Even without dark pools you could always do direct trades[1] with a party of your choosing, which is even more private and exclusive. The \"private rooms\" mentioned in this article just makes this slightly more automated than some trader messaging his buddies on the bloomberg terminal.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_(finance)\n \nreply",
      "> won't impact pricesI strongly suspect that wall street has looked at 401k's/index funds as a giant money filled pi\u00f1ata. It is a huge pile of money following a well understood algorithm which makes it vulnerable to attack.I suspect that this is the absolute core of \"dark pool\" strategy. Any trade that happens behind closed doors that \"doesn't impact prices\" means that an index fund is buying or selling at a price other than the \"real\" price meaning that dark pools are functionally a wealth transfer from grandma to an institutional trader.\n \nreply",
      "It's actually the other way around. As a big fund looking to trade a large number of shares in the public market, you'll quickly realize that the market tends to move away from you, and statistically, you're more likely to get a bad deal than a good one. Even if you try to be smart about execution by splitting your orders into chunks, randomizing order sizes, and similar tactics, there is still a huge information asymmetry between you and more sophisticated players. In many cases, they can classify your orders based on different characteristics of your order flow (such as latency profile), distinguishing them from so-called toxic flow from other HFT firms.The purpose of these private rooms is to separate your orders from those players so that you trade against other uninformed parties, making your chances of getting a good or bad deal closer to 50/50.\n \nreply",

      "It is not clear to me what nefarious things people believe are going on there that we should be worried about.All the article says is that people are doing things we don't know about, but implies that somehow we should feel not-okay about this.I don't know what's going on in my neighbor's house either, and it could certainly be bad stuff, but that's doesn't mean that it is bad or that I should start spying on them.\n \nreply",
      "If you look up RegNMS the goal is to make public markets fair by having rules that have to be met in order to trade. Dark pools allow participants to 'hide' information that's not public. It is mostly about the order books. If dark pool sell order for 1B of TSLA stock goes on the order book, only other members of the pool get that information. The dark pools are required to still follow RegNMS rules for trade prices, but there is an inherent asymmetry in the market information in this case as the dark pool participants can see the public markets and their dark pool in order to make trading decisions.In your neighbor's house example, it would be like if there was a street market auction for trading cards happening in your neighbor's front yard, but in the house your neighbor and another neighbor had gotten together to trade 100x the average #of cards using the prices they hear from outside, and the people outside only see the deal they made after it's done.\n \nreply",
      "And what would the problem be with that example? It seems everyone has agreed on a fair price and is trading on it. There isn't any incentive for the private traders to trade at a different price or one of them is getting ripped off due to the arbitrage potential. And they don't believe that publicising the trade would move the price or - again - one of them would have an incentive to do so because it'd move in their favour.I don't see how I'd be disadvantaged as any actor in that scene.\n \nreply",

This is basically trading 101. If you want to do a big selloff, you're not going to dump all of that in one order.\n \nreply",
      "But by breaking up the order they have to wait and the market can move in reaction to their sell off unless they do it very slowly. Dark pools can completely hide a large sell or buy order from the market long enough to execute at the current strike if there's another member in the pool buying. They wouldn't use it if it didn't give them an advantage because it costs more than regular trades.\n \nreply"

      "This is fantastic. I've always used JavE before but this being a single HTML file is a big+ and packs quite a punch. Kudos to the author!One question though, how do edit the content later? For example I generated a few diagrams one at a time and pasted those in a local plain text file. Later when I want to edit a particular diagram/part, I tried copy pasted it in, but always got \"cannot paste, content leaves canvas\" error. If I tried copy-pasting a really small section (e.g. 3x3 table), it pasted it right in the center. Anyway, not sure if that's  an intended work flow or not. Great job regardless.\n \nreply",
      "Glad you asked. Have you checked the online version https://cascii.appThere, all exported drawings come with a short link. This is so that months later anyone reading / seeing can edit their own copy online / keep it up to date.You can also create an account to manage your own drawings.Side note - when you use real pasting, it will not remember meaningful information (that's very hard to do elegantly). In your example, I'm guessing that 3x3 table you pasted in could not be properly edited like a table again. Hence, use short links so that Cascii remembers state.\n \nreply",
