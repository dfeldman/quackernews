      "A lot of people seem confused about this acquisition because they think of Bun as a node.js compatible bundler / runtime and just compare it to Deno / npm. But I think its a really smart move if you think of where Bun has been pushing into lately which is a kind of cloud-native self contained runtime (S3 API, SQL, streaming, etc). For an agent like Claude Code this trajectory is really interesting as you are creating a runtime where your agent can work inside of cloud services as fluently as it currently does with a local filesystem. Claude will be able to leverage these capabilities to extend its reach across the cloud and add more value in enterprise use casesreply",
      "Yea, they just posted this a few days ago:https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-useThey discussed how running generated code is better for context management in many cases. The AI can generate code to retrieve, process, and filter the data it needs rather than doing it in-context, thus reducing context needs. Furthermore, if you can run the code right next to the server where the data is, it's all that much faster.I see Bun like a Skynet: if it can run anywhere, the AI can run anywhere.reply",

Anthropic is betting on Bun as the infrastructure powering Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK, and future AI coding products & tools.Claude Code ships as a Bun executable to millions of users.

The codebase got kind of large, and the iteration cycle time took 45 seconds to test if changes worked. Most of that time was spent waiting for the Next.js dev server to hot reload.This was frustrating, and I got really distracted trying to fix it.I started porting esbuild's JSX & TypeScript transpiler from Go to Zig. Three weeks later, I had a somewhat working JSX & TypeScript transpiler.Early benchmark from a new JavaScript bundler.

Places that make them very difficult to find. Even more insidious is when they embed themselves in the harness, only to make an appearance weeks or months later when the outdoor foxtails have mostly been cut down.The problem is that they can work their way under the skin with a barbed spike that is one-way only.

The video shows that it doesn't mix the gameplay sounds with the music track, so it pauses the music every time to play a sound (gun shot, door opening, item pick up, etc). This is really distracting compared to the adlib driver that mixes them together and so the music doesn't stop/start harshly. And IIRC, the adlib music is quieter then the effects, which also helps the music stay as background sounds. I don't think Id was lazy, just thinking about the full experience.reply",

The PC speaker sound effects are bad enough (which is to say \"as good as they can be, but still bad\") and sound \"cheap\", and adding beep-speaker music on top of that would just result in a noisy mess - as evidenced by the video.The beep-speaker music in Commander Keen was good and fit the theme of the game - but to keep the environment of Doom and the dark and moody feel and not be limited to the dulcet tones of a tiny piezo buzzer was a design decision, not being lazy.Note that they could have supported Disney Sound Source / Covax Speech Thing style audio (they did in Wolf3D and Keen) but skipped that as well, likely for the same reason - it would have sounded like murky hollow garbage.You can email John Romero and ask him, he responds to emails - my guess is that he will say \"yeah we considered it, it sounded bad, we abandoned the idea\" not that they were lazy.

      "Adding a comment here with some info on LIDAR human safety, since many are asking.There are two wavelengths of interest used:  a) 905 nm/940 nm (roof and bumpers): 70\u2013100 \u00b5J per pulse max, regulated by IEC 60825 since this WL is focused on the retina\n  b) 1550 nm systems (the Laser Bear Honeycomb): 8\u201312 mJ per pulse allowed (100x more photons since this WL stays the cornea)\n\nThe failure mode of these LIDARs can be akin to a weapon. A stuck mirror or frozen phased array turns into a continuous-wave pencil beam.\n  A 1550 nm LIDAR leaking 1W continuous will raise corneal temperature >5C in 100ms. The threshold for cataract creation is only 4C rise in temp. \n  A 905 nm Class 1 system stuck in one pixel gives 10 mW continuous on retina, capable of creating a lesion in 250ms or less.20 cars at an intersection = 20 overlapping scanners, meaning even if each meets single-device Class 1, linear addition could offer your retina a 20x dose enough to push into Class 3B territory. The current regs (IEC 60825-1:2014) assume single-source exposure. There is no standard for multi-source, multi-axis, moving-platform overlay.Additionally, no LIDAR manufacturer publishes beam-failure shutoff latency. Most are >50ms, which can be long enough for permanent injuryreply",
      "The article talks about eye safety a bit in section 4.> a stuck mirrorThis is one of the advantages of using an array of low power lasers rather than steering a single high power laser. The array physically doesn't have a failure mode where the power gets concentrated in a single direction. Anyway, theoretically, you would hope that class 1 eye-safe lidars should be eye safe even at point blank range, meaning that even if the beam gets stuck pointing into your eye, it would still be more or less safe.> 20 cars at an intersection = 20 overlapping scanners, meaning even if each meets single-device Class 1, linear addition could offer your retina a 20x dose enough to push into Class 3B territory.In the article, I point out a small nuance: If you have many lidars around, the beams from each 905 nm lidar will be focused to a different spot on your retina, and you are no worse off than if there was a single lidar. But if there are many 1550 nm lidars around, their beams will have a cumulative effect at heating up your cornea, potentially exceeding the safety threshold.Also, if a lidar is eye-safe at point blank range, when you have multiple cars tens of meters away, laser beam divergence already starts to reduce the intensity, not to mention that when the lidars are scanning properly, the probability of all of them pointing in the same spot is almost impossible.By the way, the Waymo Laser Bear Honeycomb is the bumper lidar (940 nm iirc) and not the big 1550 nm unit that was on the Chrysler Pacificas. The newer Jaguar I-Pace cars don't have the 1550 nm lidar at all but have a much bigger and higher performance spinning lidar.reply",

The least obtrusive option I've found is this Zeiss lens coating (\"Thermo Force\") which claims to block 90% of IR \"between 780 and 2000 nm\", which covers the NIR used in both types of lidar. It only seems to be available as part of sunglasses though.reply",
      "A quick note about units -- you correctly quote the limits as an energy-per-pulse limit. The theory behind this is that pulses are short enough that rotation during a pulse is negligible, so they tend to hit a single point (on the retina, at focusable frequencies; the cornea itself for longer wave lengths), and the absorption of that energy is what causes damage. But LiDAR range is determined not by energy per pulse, but by power. This drives a desire for minimum-time pulses, often < 10 ns -- if you can halve your pulse length, you can increase your range substantially while still being eye-safe. GaNFETs are one of the enabling technologies for pulsed lidar, since they're really the only way out there to steer tens of amps in single-digit nanoseconds. Even once you've solved generating short pulses, though, you still need to interpret short responses. Which drives either a need for very fast ADCs (gigasample+), or TDCs, which are themselves fascinating components.reply"

      "Overall this article is accurate and well-researched. Thanks to Daroc Alden for due diligence. Here are a couple of minor corrections:> When using an Io.Threaded instance, the async() function doesn't actually do anything asynchronously \u2014 it just runs the provided function right away.While this is a legal implementation strategy, this is not what std.Io.Threaded does. By default, it will use a configurably sized thread pool to dispatch async tasks. It can, however, be statically initialized with init_single_threaded in which case it does have the behavior described in the article.The only other issue I spotted is:> For that use case, the Io interface provides a separate function, asyncConcurrent() that explicitly asks for the provided function to be run in parallel.There was a brief moment where we had asyncConcurrent() but it has since been renamed more simply to concurrent().reply",
      "Hey Andrew, question for you about something the article litely touches on but doesn't really discuss further:>  If the programmer uses async() where they should have used asyncConcurrent(), that is a bug. Zig's new model does not (and cannot) prevent programmers from writing incorrect code, so there are still some subtleties to keep in mind when adapting existing Zig code to use the new interface.What class of bug occurs if the wrong function is called? Is it \"UB\" depending on the IO model provided, a logic issue, or something else?reply",
      "A deadlock.For example, the function is called immediately, rather than being run in a separate thread, causing it to block forever on accept(), because the connect() is after the call to async().If concurrent() is used instead, the I/O implementation will spawn a new thread for the function, so that the accept() is handled by the new thread, or it will return error.ConcurrencyUnavailable.async() is infallible. concurrent() is fallible.reply",
      "I think this design is very reasonable. However, I find Zig's explanation of it pretty confusing: they've taken pains to emphasize that it solves the function coloring problem, which it doesn't: it pushes I/O into an effect type, which essentially behaves as a token that callers need to retain. This is a form of coloring, albeit one that's much more ergonomic.(To my understanding this is pretty similar to how Go solves asynchronicity, expect that in Go's case the \"token\" is managed by the runtime.)reply",
      "This solves a problem for library authors which is that blocking and event-based io implementations of functionality look the same but are not actually the same so users end up complaining when you do one but not the other.It adds a problem of needing to pass the global kind of io through a program. I think this mostly isn\u2019t a huge problem because typical good program design has io on the periphery and so you don\u2019t tend to need to pass this io object that \u2018deep\u2019. This is not too different from the type-system effect of IO in Haskell (except that one only does evented IO IIRC). It isn\u2019t as bad because it only affects input types (data which can be closed over, I assume) rather than output types. Eg in Haskell you need various special functions to change from [ IO a ] to IO [ a ] but in the zig model you iterate over your list in the normal way using an io value from an outer scope.The one case where Io-colouring was annoying to me in Haskell was adding printf debugging (there is a function to cheat the type system for this). Zig may have other solutions to that, eg a global io value for blocking io in debug builds or some global logging system.reply",
      "If calling the same function with a different argument would be considered 'function coloring', every function in a program is 'colored' and the word loses its meaning ;)Zig actually also had solved the coloring problem in the old and abandondend async-await solution because the compiler simply stamped out a sync- or async-version of the same function based on the calling context (this works because everything is a single compilation unit).reply",
      "In that case JS is not colored either because an async function is simply a normal function that returns a Promise.As far as I understand, coloring refers to async and sync functions having the same calling syntax and interface, I.e.    b = readFileAsync(p)\n    b = readFileSync(p)\n\nshare the same calling syntax. Whereas    b = await readFileAsync(p)\n    readFileAsync(p).then(b => ...)\n    \n    b = readFileSync(b)\n\nare different.If you have to call async functions with a different syntax or interface, then it's colored.reply",
      "> If calling the same function with a different argument would be considered 'function coloring', than every function in a program is 'colored' and the word loses its meaning ;)Well, yes, but in this case the colors (= effects) are actually important. The implications of passing an effect through a system are nontrivial, which is why some languages choose to promote that effect to syntax (Rust) and others choose to make it a latent invariant (Java, with runtime exceptions). Zig chooses another path not unlike Haskell's IO.reply",

      "Back in the late 90s, when I first entered the video game industry to work (when it was quite scruffy, countercultural, and populated by some pretty odd people), one of the first things I encountered was a new co-worker who, next to his giant tower of used Mountain Dew cans, had a black and white TV in his cubicle.  This struck me as very odd at that moment in time - as I understood things, obviously the point of work was supposed to be that it was a place where you worked, not a place where you watched TV.  (Now, granted, everyone else was playing the recently released Diablo on their work PCs during lunch in network mode, and we were a game studio after all, so my reaction wasn't totally coherent).  Still, no one else had a TV, and that guy was young and single with no work-life balance, he was a recent transplant, and it still seemed unusual at the time.Fast forward 28 years later, and now everyone has an amazing TV in their pocket at all times when they commute, sit in their work space, go out for coffee or lunch, or go sit down in the bathroom, all with a near infinite collection of video via youtube, netflix, and even massive amounts of porn.  How little did I know.  And  that's to say nothing of texting and twitter and reddit and instant messaging and discord and ...Several years ago, I was working on a college campus, and there were giant corporate-flavored murals beside some of the city blocks students walked, full of happy multicultural clip art people and exciting innovative technological innovation, and adorned with the message, \"Imagine a borderless world!\"  Clearly that message was meant to be rhetorical, not a call to reflection, critique, or reevaluation.  There did not seem to be the suggestion that one might imagine the borderless world and then, having done so, decide it was a problem to be corrected.I wonder a lot, these days, if we're not deep into a Chesterton's Fence situation, where we have to rediscover the hard way the older wisdom about having separate spheres with separate hard constraints and boundaries on behaviors, communities, and communication pathways to facilitate all sorts of important activities that simply don't happen otherwise - something like borders and boundaries as a crucial social technology, specifically about directing attention productively.  Phones and tablets are, in their own Turing complete way, portals to a borderless world that pierces the older intentional classroom boundaries.reply",

For example, if you want to be notified when a product is back in stock, or when a website goes online, or when a domain becomes available, YesNotice can notify you via email or SMS the moment that change happens.As far as I know, no such tool exists that focuses specifically on this use case, so I built it. You can read more about it and sign up at\nyesnotice.com.YesNotice works by periodically checking the status of the item you care about (e.g., product stock, website availability, domain status) and comparing it to the previous status. When it detects a change from no to yes, it sends you a notification via email.You can customize the frequency of checks and the notification method in your YesNotice dashboard. It\u2019s designed to be simple and easy to use, so you can focus"
