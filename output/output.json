      "After a bad breakup in 2015, I followed some advice from the socialskills subreddit to \u201ctalk to everyone\u201d so that you get better at talking to women you might want to date. The advice was not to only talk to attractive people but everyone. The old man reading a Russian newspaper, the kid on bike doing tricks, people in the elevator.I do that now and it brings me a lot of joy. Recently while leaving a botanical garden I spoke to a man who was excitedly looking for a few specific plants. He is a botanist (amateur? professional? unclear) and I enjoyed sharing in his passion for a moment. Then I saw a maintenance guy moving with great intention who took a moment to ask me and my family if we had a nice time. We did, and I asked him about the papers in his hand. \u201cGotta get approval for this purchase request asap.\u201d He said. We talked a bit about how nice it is to work at such a beautiful place.I highly recommend talking to strangers! People are lovely. Go out and try it.reply",
      "When I was staying with my older brothers, one of their magazines was along the lines of maybe a GQ but in the 90\u2019s, iirc I was probably in middle school, and probably reading content a bit above my age level in terms of concept.One of their articles though was about \u201ctalking to women\u201d but it also emphasized just talking to _anyone_. It had suggestions like \u201cif you\u2019re out at the bar, just ask to sit with a random group, introduce yourself, and have a conversation.\u201dMany years later in college, I did indeed try this at a bar and was pleasantly surprised. I didn\u2019t make any long term friends, or find a new partner, but I did really start honing the skill of being social with anyone. It\u2019s hard, and especially for me and my social anxiety, it has also really helped me feel more comfortable in places unfamiliar and people unknown.reply",
      "It really helps to learn in an environment where failure isn't emotionally catastrophic. If you only talk to people that are interesting or important to you, then you can end up learning the wrong things because failure hits so hard. The desperation this can create will further serve to drive people away!People need to feel like it's safe to develop relations with you, rather than like you're trying to manipulate them into doing so, which is what happens when you learn only from very hard failures.reply",
      "I found mixed results given underlying anxiety that hadn't been diagnosed at the point I was trying this. Talking to new people at work, while out pursuing hobbies, and around town, all accrued to more and better conversations.It was a much bigger struggle with conversations where I was putting extra pressure on myself. Being able to have those other conversations was helpful though. Eventually, I found a therapist and am in a better place with this.reply",
      "Letting curiosity be the motivator behind starting these conversations and cultivating curiosity more broadly can help -- or at least I have found it to be helpful in making initiating feel less forced. I wonder about people's jobs or the reasons they are visiting a place or what they think about what's happening nearby, or just generally who they are.One antipattern I've encountered with this approach tho is that sometimes anxious people will exhaust their conversation partners with a battery of questions. Even if thoughtful, this can sometimes have the effect of exhausting your partner, and tends to keep the conversation steered away from actual connection. YMMV, but either way be mindful and make it a point to share yourselfreply",
      "To summarize, the suggestion was to live like you live in the Midwest outside of urban/suburban areas. That's very funny to me.My spouse had a hard time acclimating to rural Midwest life after living in a mega city on the East Coast. She complained that everything takes an extra half hour for time spent standing around talking about nothing.It never dawned on me that if you're from a place, like a large city, where interacting with strangers or very distant acquaintances isn't encouraged, that this would not be a natural part of life.I find this interesting but don't know what to do with that.reply",
      "I love this. I know I struggle with \"I don't want to bother this person\".How do you deal with that?reply",
      "> \"I don't want to bother this person\".> How do you deal with that?You teach yourself to say no, to the things you don't want to do.I considered leaving just that pithy reply, because that's really it. But some of the extra context; It's not a bother to ask someone to hold the door they're already going through because your hands are full. Starting a conversation is about as intrusive as that. The vast majority of people don't mind making some small talk, and ontop of that, the majority can make an excuse if they don't have time. You only assume they can't politely decline, because you can't. Once you learn to say no thanks, politely, but explicitly and directly. You'll actually understand and expect others to return the favor.That's a much more fair way to interact with people too.reply",
      "I echo this so much.I'd add also that learning to hear someone tell you no and not taking it to heart and getting on with your life. So many people walk through life being afraid of hearing someone reply \"no\" to them, like its some existential rejection of them and that stops them from doing many things.I'll make chit chat with anyone, and people who dont want to chat with are generally pretty explicit about saying they dont want to chat or don't have time, or pretty obviously implicit about it by not engaging or looking for ways out.reply",
      ">You teach yourself to say no, to the things you don't want to do.I feel that line of thinking can have some very grave consequences. My mind is swimming with intrusive thoughts half the time.reply"

      "I'm the original creator of Ghostty. It's been a few years now! I don't know why this is on the front page of HN again but let me give some meaningful updates across the board.First, libghostty is _way more exciting_ nowadays. It is already backing more than a dozen terminal projects that are free and commercial: https://github.com/Uzaaft/awesome-libghostty I think this is the real future of Ghostty and I've said this since my first public talk on Ghostty in 2023: the real goal is a diverse ecosystem of terminal emulators that aim to solve specific terminal usage but all based on a shared, stable, feature-rich, high performant core. It's happening! More details what libghostty is here: https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-comingI suspect by the middle of 2027, the number of people using Ghostty via libghostty will dwarf the number of users that actually use the Ghostty GUI. This is a win on all sides, because more libghostty usage leads to more stable Ghostty GUI too (since Ghostty itself is... of course... a libghostty consumer). We've already had many bugs fixed sourced by libghostty embedders.On the GUI front Ghostty the apps are still getting lots of new features and are highly used. Ghostty the macOS app gets around one million downloads per week (I have no data on Linux because I don't produce builds). I'm sure a lot of that is automated but it's still a big number. I have no telemetry in Ghostty to give more detailed notes. I have some data from big 3rd party TUI apps with telemetry that show Ghostty as their biggest user base but that is skewed towards people consuming newer TUIs tend to use newer terminals. The point is: lots of people use it, its proven in the real world, and we're continuing to improve it big time.Ghostty 1.3 is around the corner, literally a week or two away, and will bring some critically important features like search (cmd+f), scrollbars, and dozens more. In addition to GUI features it ships some big improvements to VT functionality, as always.Organizationally, Ghostty is now backed by a non-profit organization: https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit And just this past week we signed our first 4 contributor contracts to pay contributors real money! Our finances are all completely public and transparent online. This is to show the commitment I have to making Ghostty non-commercial and non-reliant on me (the second part over time).That's a 10,000 foot overview of what's going on. Exciting times in Ghostty land. :) Happy to answer any big questions.reply",
      "What's it been like managing a fairly large project with Zig? I know you've spoken highly of the language in the past, but recently it seems like Zig has been through some substantial changes that would be relevant to a terminal emulator. I'm curious how painful the churn has been for project maintainers.reply",
      "It's been extremely good. I should really blog about it in more detail because I do get asked this question regularly. It's been very good.The large language changes are a burden, but it's something I knew going into it. And so far in every case, it's been well worth it. For example, 0.15 introduced the std.Io.Writer overhaul, but I really love the new API. I haven't started the std.Io change yet for 0.16. We'll see. And honestly, LLMs make this all way less painful... even though they're not trained on it, agents are able to run builds, reference docs, and work their way through the upgrade with huge success.I thought that finding contributors would be an issue, but it hasn't at all. There's a lot of people out there eager to use Zig, the language isn't hard to learn (as long as you're already familiar with systems concepts), etc. It has been good.I'll think about more to say if I write about this more but overall, I'm very happy with the language, the community, and the leadership. All good.reply",
      "That's super interesting to hear. I see people say all the time \"oh I would never use it in a big project because it's changing so fast\", but then see awesome projects like Ghostty and Tiger Beatle written in it, so clearly they're doing something right.I'm surprised to hear LLMs have been helpful. What little I tried to use them for with Zig, all the information was way too out of date. But I was mainly just doing research, not running an agent at the time, so that's probably why.reply",
      "Yes, LLMs with Zig are absolutely useless without agentic behaviors. Throw an agent in the mix and it's totally fine. Bonus points if you pair it with some basic agent skills so it knows how to look up language references, stdlib files, etc. then it does even better.reply",
      "I'll have to give it another try the next time I play around with Zig. I decided to let all the big changes with IO and what not play out before diving back in lol.I've been slow on the agent pickup. The ethical issues really bother me (LLMs in general), though it's clear I'm not gonna have a choice in this industry so I've been caving recently. The persistent narrative that agents can build entire complex software systems is also irritating, because that clearly doesn't seem to align with reality.reply",
      "Would you mind sharing or pointing me to any links that explain how you've set up Zig to work effectively with LLMs using agentic features?I was thinking that downloading the full official documentation, separated by sections inside the repository someone is working on with Zig, could be useful, but maybe there are more optimal ways to approach this.Thanks.reply",
      "Do you get frustrated in using a low training data language like zig with AI models? I've noticed that models tend to be better with languages like TypeScript than Swift because of issues like that.reply",

I've had Claude download the sources of ffmpeg and blender to obtain deeper understanding of certain things that aren't much documented.

However, I use a third-party MCP because my company has a data centre deployment of Jira and Confluence, which the official Atlassian MCP does not support.My use case was for using it as an advanced search tool rather than for creating tickets or documentation. Considering how poor the Confluence search function is, the results from Confluence via an MCP-powered search are remarkably good.

      "Strongly disagree, despite that meaning I'm swimming upstream here.Unlike cli flags, with MCP I can tune the comments for the tool more easily (for my own MCPs at least) than a cli flag.

It's easier for me to ensure dangerous flags or parameters aren't used, and to ensure concrete restrictions and checks are in place. If you control the cli tools it isn't as bad, but if you don't, and it isn't a well known cli tool, the agent might need things like vague errors explaing to it a bit.MCP is more like \"REST\" or \"GRPC\", at the simplest level just think of it as a wrapper.You mentioned redirecting to files, what if the output is too much that way, you'll still burn tokens. But with MCP, if the output is too much you can count the tokens and limit, or... better yet you can paginate so that it gets some results, it sees how many results there are and either decides to re-run the tool with params that will yield less results, or consume the results page-by-page.reply",

      "A 'secret weapon' that has served me very well for learning classifiers is to first learn a good linear classifier. I am almost hesitant to give this away (kidding).Use the non-thresholded version of that linear classifier output as one additional feature-dimension over which you learn a decision tree. Then wrap this whole thing up as a system of boosted trees (that is, with more short trees added if needed).One of the reasons why it works so well, is that it plays to their strengths:(i) Decision trees have a hard time fitting linear functions (they have to stair-step a lot, therefore need many internal nodes) and(ii) linear functions are terrible where equi-label regions have a recursively partitioned structure.In the decision tree building process the first cut would usually be on the synthetic linear feature added, which would earn it the linear classifier accuracy right away, leaving the DT algorithm to work on the part where the linear classifier is struggling. This idea is not that different from boosting.One could also consider different (random) rotations of the data to form a forest of trees build using steps above, but was usually not necessary. Or rotate the axes so that all are orthogonal to the linear classifier learned.One place were DT struggle is when the features themselves are very (column) sparse, not many places to place the cut.reply",
      "If you think about it, this what reinforcement learning folks are doing. They use the vanilla state and then they lift it to the observed state by doing some additional calculation with the original state data.For example you start with the raw coordinates of snake in a snake game, but you now can calculate how many escape routes the snake has, and train on it.reply",
      "That\u2019s correctI\u2019ve spent most of the last 20 years doing reinforcement learning and it is exceptionally simple conceptuallyThe challenge is data acquisition and the right types of process frameworksreply",
      "I think it's worth mentioning, that the achilles heel of DT, is in fact, data (more specifically feature) engineering. If one does not spend significant time cleaning and engineering the features, the results would be much worse than, say a \"black box\" model, like NN. This is the catch. Ironically, NN can detect such latent features, but very difficult to interpret why.reply",
      "This varies so wildly from domain to domain. Highly structured data (time series, photos, audio, etc.) typically has a metric boatload of feature extraction methodology. Neural networks often draw on and exploit that structure (i.e. convolutions). You could even get some pretty good results on manually-extracted neural-network-esque features handed off to a random forest. This heuristic begins to fall off with deep learning though, which imo, is a precursor to LLMs and showed that emergent complexity is possible with machine learning.But non-structured data? Pretty pointless to hand off to a neural network imo.reply",
      "Ah! Your comment helped me understand the parent comment so much more. I thought it was more about data hygiene needs.Yes a DT on raw pixel values, or a DT on raw time values will in general be quite terrible.That said the convolutional structure is hard coded in those neural nets, only the weights are learned. It is not that the network discovered on its own that convolutions are a good idea. So NNs too really (damn autocorrect, it's rely, rely) on human insight and structuring upon which they can then build over.reply",
      "That has not been my experience though, apart from the need of standard data hygiene that one has to maintain for any ML exercise.Normalising the numeric features to a common range has been adequate. This too is strictly not necessary for DTs, but pretty much mandatory for linear models. (DTs are very robust to scale differences among features, linear models quite vulnerable to the same.)One can think of each tree path from root to leaf as a data driven formulation/synthesis of a higher level feature built out of logical conjunctions ('AND' operation).These auto-synthesized / discovered features are then ORed at the top. DTs are good at capturing multi-feature interactions that single layer linear models can't.NNs certainly synthesize higher level features, but what does not get highlighted enough is that learning-theory motivated Adaboost algorithm and it's derivatives do that too.Their modus operandi is \"BYOWC, bring your own weak classifier, I will reweigh the data in such a way that your unmodified classifier will discover a higher level feature on its own. Later you can combine these higher features linearly, by voting, or by averaging\".I personally favor differentiable models over trees, but have to give credit where it's due, DTs work great.What leaves me intellectually unsatisfied about decision trees is that the space of trees cannot be searched in any nice principled way.Or to describe in terms of feature discovery, in DT, there's no notion of progressing smoothly towards better high level features that track the end goal at every step of this synthesis (in fact greedy hill climbing hurts performance in the case of decision trees). DTs use a combinatorial search over the feature space partitioning, essentially by trial and error.Neural nets have a smooth way of devising these higher level features informed by the end goal. Roll infinitesimally in the direction of steepest progress -- that's so much more satisfying than trial and error.As for classification performance where DT have struggled are cases where columns are sparse (low entropy to begin with).Another weakness of DT is the difficulty of achieving high throughput runtime performance, unless the DT is compiled into machine code. Walking a runtime tree structure with not so predictable branching probabilities that doe'snt run very fast on our standard machines. Compared to DNNs though this is a laughable complaint, throughput of DTs are an order of one or two faster.reply",

Any simple ML library would have a linear classifier and a tree learner.Super easy to implement, train, maintain, debug. One to two person team can handle this fine.reply",

Almost every tree with a Diameter \u2265 0.45 is an Oak tree! Thus, we can probably assume that any other trees we find in that region will also be one. This first decision node will act as our root node. We'll draw a vertical line at this Diameter and classify everything above it as Oak (our first leaf node), and continue to partition our remaining data on the left.  We continue along, hoping to split our plot of land in the most favorable manner. We see that creating a new decision node at Height \u2264 4.88 leads to a nice section of Cherry trees, so we partition our data there.

      "I am an iPhone user myself, but the number of \"this is an android problem\" and \"just use iPhone\" in response to the author's complaints surprises me. I thought HN was more anti apple in the past? Maybe we are all old now and tinkering with our devices is out of fashion, but this doesn't make the author's complaints illegitimate.And if we zoom out a bit, iPhones are only 20% of the global phone market. The overwhelming majority of the world uses android because, well, iPhones are expensive. There are plenty of places where an iPhone is still a status symbol. Even you think the author should have bought his parents iPhones instead, there is still a whole world of people out there who would benefit from improvements in the android ecosystem.reply",
      "It used to be better.I've been running Android custom ROMs since Gingerbread days, on HTC HD2. At that time, I'd be flashing nightlies, switching between CyanogenMod and Paranoid Android, kernels, getting bootloops.Setting up the phone was no big deal - most apps could be backed up with Titanium Backup, few that couldn't (e.g. banking) would just get redownloaded and I'd log in immediately. I was also still a student back then and had more time to tinker, but if it was anything like it is now, I would've given up much quicker.In the last year I had to do few clean flashes with changing my phone, then updating LineageOS, and once the phone just wiped itself for no reason. Backups don't work for most apps - even if you can get one, they'll crash without a specific reason. 2FA everywhere is mostly security theater, with apps that have no business keeping my data but insisting on it, using SMS, email, authenticators, selfies. Banking apps needing two layers of root detection circumvention (because a custom ROM is already problematic, so you need root to stop them from detecting an unlocked bootloader, and then again not to detect root). Google insisting on sending a security check notification to a phone that's just been wiped with no ability to confirm that it's really you from your PC (but if you give it few minutes, it will give in and let you verify with SMS), always feels like hacking yourself.It's a massive pain already on a clean, bloatware-free custom ROM, with a truly minimum app list. Once you need to start debloating the official OS, it's another hour or three, depending if they're nice and let you uninstall things or if you need adb access to disable offending packages.reply",
      "I found that TiBackup was both the secret sauce that allowed for playing with ROMs with impunity, and also my primary reason for rooting phones back in the day even when I was just using phones in stock form.It was the first app I ever spent money on, and I did so without any hesitation at all.It was just genuinely useful to be able to back up and restore my own data on my own devices, and to do so on my own accord.  It was a process that I owned, and controlled, and if it went wrong somehow then I was able to troubleshoot it and make sensible decisions.I haven't had a rooted phone in a decade or so now.  These days, backups allegedly happen -- somehow -- and the entire process seems to be both deliberately and inscrutably shrouded in mystery.When I switch devices or reset to factory to try to fix an eSIM issue (or whatever I do that makes restoration a useful path today), then it's never clear before I start whether the backup/restore will magically work or if it will simply fail without recourse.  The uncertainty demonstrates a reprehensibly terrible way to deal with backups.reply",
      "\u201cPhones\u201d in the title is doing lots of heavy lifting. \u201cAndroid phones\u201d is the key missing piece.I love Free software too, and I wish I could run more of my life on it, but it\u2019s no longer my hobby. I like cars, too, but I don\u2019t work on a hobby car. The author\u2019s experience is why I use proprietary stuff like Apple for these parts of my life. A new Apple device is usually a non-event: charge it, authenticate, wait for the back to restore while you go about your business.The cost of more freedom (in this case, from proprietary toolchains and data lakes) is needing to exercise more control (compiling custom Android images). I just, honest to god, don\u2019t want to spend the time on it. A kid, a house, cats, getting old. I like that someone else has solved multi-device backup and restore, and I feel happy watching it happen so perfectly, even if I\u2019m not the one controlling it.reply",
      "> I use proprietary stuff like Apple for these parts of my life. A new Apple device is usually a non-event: charge it, authenticate, wait for the back to restore while you go about your business.Most of the author's criticisms were centered on avoiding account creation and third-party apps. I'm not sure I would give Apple the benefit of the doubt here since the motivations are different: Apple is far more interested in locking customers into their own ecosystem. On the Android front, that isn't all that different from getting a Pixel. Of course, getting an Android based Samsung adds an extra company who wants to do the same as well as selling space to third parties.While Android being more open does add complexity, it is mostly limited to those who buy devices produced by another vendor or those who choose to exercise their freedom (e.g. by choosing to install a third-party version of Android, or installing a third-party \"app store\", or developing their own software).reply",
      "that isn't all that different from getting a Pixel.Paradox is, that with Pixel device you can get most freedom and security togather. Installation of GrapheneOS is easiest custom ROM installation that could possibly be.reply",
      "I tried it, Graphene isn't really a good alternative because the built in apps are so bad that you end up needing to install the Pixel/Google versions anyway.If I have to install Google Messages for RCS, Google Calendar, Google Contacts, Pixel Camera (which forces you to use Google Photos for basic functionality), \u2026 where is the benefit?If I have to turn Graphene into a Pixel to make it usable, and I did, there\u2019s not much point. And the apps are 90% of the time very noticeably better on iOS, so overall turns into a very bad trade.reply",
      "You still get much better privacy with GrapheneOS even if you install Google apps since they are sandboxed; they don't have access to unique device identifiers and you can control what Google can access by adjusting its permissions, as opposed to having full reign to do whatever it wants. Also you don't have to use all the Google apps, plenty of open source and/or privacy respecting alternatives out there.\nPixel Camera only needs Google Photos for the photo previewer, everything else works without it or you can install gcam services provider to use any gallery you wantreply",
      "> Installation of GrapheneOSand you get absolutely nothing in return. Yeah you will have root access sometimes. But other than that, android is not opensource anymore.I mean, it never was because you had hundreds (no exaggeration [1]) closed-binary blobs running (not to mention a whole OS on things like radio and camera, running on their own SoC),  but now you cannot get even close to a proper of the userspace since google already anounced they will not be mainlining anything back to AOSP[1] zero source for kernel pieces, even for pixel https://github.com/GrapheneOS/device_google_laguna-kernels_6...reply",
      "> and you get absolutely nothing in return. Yeah you will have root access sometimes.You get improved privacy and security, at least on some fronts. By default, GrapheneOS does not provide root access and recommends against rooting the device. Is there a trade-off? Certainly. Security and privacy are always at conflict with what a completely open platform can provide. Given the amount of access to personal information that goes through our devices and the number of bad actors out there (both behaving legally and illicitly), some people believe \nit is worth the price. At least GrapheneOS offers more transparency than Android or iOS.The bit about clamping down on open source, that is very much disappointing. I doubt that it is going to go away entirely in Android. On the other hand, hopefully it will provide incentives for companies to explore developing more open alternatives and consumers to explore buying more open alternatives. It won't be a huge market, but many of us have avoided growing so dependent upon the current platforms that we couldn't simply walk away.reply"

      "Most of the comments here talk about the GIMP UX. Fair point, but misses the article entirely.> [\u00d8yvind] is the maintainer of GEGL and babl, the color engines of GIMP. His work was instrumental in (among many other things) the long-waited non-destructive filters implemented in GIMP 3.0The interview is about Pippin's background (fine arts) and current (as of the time of the interview) work, and in some details about the graphics engine underneath GIMP (GEGL).FWIW, it doesn't touch on the UI/UX side at all. So even you Photoshop lovers may find it interesting :)reply",
      "I must be the only GIMP user that has never complained about the UX. But I have never used Photoshop so I\u2019m not fighting muscle memory.reply",
      "I think it might be muscle memory. I started using GIMP in 2005 or so before the single window mode, and my muscle memory is tailor-fit to it. It felt like an extension of myself.With GIMP 3, there are a lot of improvements! But it also breaks my muscle memory a lot. GIMP 3 is objectively better, but I find myself opening 2.10 regularly.reply",
      "I love gimp, it is the only \u201cheavyweight\u201d image editor I ever learned to use, and that choice has saved me so much money in software subscriptions! Thankyou maintainers!reply",
      "I love the contrast between this and one of the next comments:>In my honest opinion, GIMP is a horrific piece of software.Both are absolutely true!GIMP has been, for many years, the best free graphics software available. At the same time, it's so horribly anti-user (and anti-usability) that if it wasn't free software, the company behind it would have gone bankrupt a long time ago.reply",
      "\"Anti-user' and \"anti-usability\" are far too harsh. Outdated, yes. A product of 1990s-era UX design, absolutely. But every changelog has some mention of a UX improvement, and actually using the product at version 3.0 is, dare I say, pretty enjoyable once you unlearn things and pretend it's Photoshop 6.0. Single-window mode by default helps a ton.I have used far worse software from commercial outfits. You would not believe how much aerospace and specialized CAD stuff still uses Motif and doesn't support scroll wheels or extra mouse buttons.reply",
      "My biggest beef is the UI constantly goes through massive changes at each release.  Options moved, mysterious new configs, literally it is as if you're using an entirely new piece of software every few years.For those of you who daily drive GIMP, well you'll be up to speed quickly.  For those of us that use it once a month or so, for a day, it quickly becomes exceptionally annoying.I'm happy if the UI isn't the best.  I frankly don't care what the software looks like, or if the GUI is purdy.  I just want it to work, work well, and frankly that menu items don't magically disappear, get merged into other sub-menus, or that now you can suddenly close a tool, and never ever get it back without finding some obscure menu item to re-activate it.And if you use GIMP frequently, and are about to say \"But, that's easy, you just...\" then you're not a casual user.There are more casual users than you think.(this goes right up there with devs who change config options in files from option= to Option=, and configs= to config=.I mean, leave it alone.  Forever.\"Updated config options to bring them inline with StudlyCaps\" or whatever turns my day into a ragefest filled anxiety attack on upgrade.\"Changed all config names to US English from British spelling.\"  What?!  OK b112, you now have to deal.I don't want to deal.  I want to eat doritos.)reply",
      "It's funny to hear that, because we get a large number of complaints that we haven't changed GIMP's interface at all from 2.10 to 3.0 and that's why we're \"failing\".We try to be respectful of existing users (and again, we get lots of complaints that doing so \"holds GIMP back\"). If you have some examples of massive changes you've dealt with (and from what version to what version), I'm happy to look into them further.reply",
      "Maybe my angst is from prior versions.  I've been using it since... well, it has existed.reply",
      "The one saving grace one might find is that a lot of people trying it already had some experience with e.g. Photoshoot and are already influenced by it. And just because Photoshop does it one way doesn't mean it's the way. But honestly, no, it's just bad bad. Thanks for all the hard work for free, but it's just really difficult to use[1]. It would've been better to do less.[1]gave up on it 10 years ago, so don't know, maybe things changedreply"
