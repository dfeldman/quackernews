      "Very cool point, and it applies to any tree data in general.I like to represent tree data with parent, type, and data vectors along with a string table, so everything else is just small integers.Sending the string table and type info as upfront headers, we can follow with a stream of parent and data vector chunks, batched N nodes at a time. Tye depth- or breadth-first streaming becomes a choice of ordering on the vectors.I'm gonna have to play around with this! Might be a general way to get snappier load time UX on network bound applications.\n \nreply",
      "99.9999%* of apps don't need anything nearly as 'fancy' as this, if resolving breadth-first is critical they can just make multiple calls (which can have very little overhead depending on how you do it).* I made it up - and by extension, the status quo is 'correct'.\n \nreply",
      "We technically didn't need more than 640K either.Having progressive or partial reads would dramatically speed up applications, especially as we move into an era of WASM on the frontend.A proper binary encoded format like protobuf with support for partial reads and well defined streaming behavior for sub message payloads would be incredible.It puts more work on the engineer, but the improvement to UX could be massive.\n \nreply",

      "I like the idea. The rental section has a lot of potential imo. It makes me wonder if there\u2019s room for the personal property rental business in tools like there is for housing and cars.I do a lot of DIY and tend to acquire a lot of the tools I use if I think they are generic enough or I\u2019ll repeat a similar job in the future but there\u2019s also jobs I do where I\u2019ll happily borrow from a friend. For example, I just built a small privacy fence that needed 5 posts cemented in. For that, I wanted to use a post hole digger. It\u2019s very unlikely I\u2019ll build another fence any time soon and a post hole digger takes up enough space that I don\u2019t want to buy one and keep one. It\u2019s also like $50.If I didn\u2019t know a friend who just built a new fence and had one but had an option of renting one from a guy down the street for $10, that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. And I\u2019d be so happy I didn\u2019t just spent $50 and then have to either store a tool that\u2019s never used again or try to sell it.I think DIY is growing, it\u2019s a great way to save money and it\u2019s only becoming easier with YouTube to help you through most any job. Good luck with the site!\n \nreply",

      "That\u2019s awesome \u2014 $35/quarter for full access is such a great deal, and tool libraries like yours are doing amazing work for local communities!Unfortunately, not every city or neighborhood has a tool library yet. That\u2019s one of the reasons we built Patio \u2014 to make tools more accessible wherever you are. We\u2019re also working with tool libraries to feature their listings and provide tools to help manage inventory, grow memberships, and reach more people.If you\u2019re interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out at julien@patio.so \u2014 would love to chat!\n \nreply",
      "Really appreciate you sharing that example\u2014it perfectly captures the kind of use case we\u2019re building Patio for. DIY is awesome, but yeah, not every tool needs to be owned, stored, or bought new. Renting something like a post hole digger from a neighbor for a few bucks just makes sense. That\u2019s exactly the gap we\u2019re trying to fill\u2014making borrowing as easy as buying, and helping people save space, money, and waste. Thanks again for the encouragement!\n \nreply",
      "How does this work and how do you deal with theft fraud and damage.\n \nreply",
      "Great questions \u2014 and ones we hear often.Patio is a community-driven platform that helps people rent and share tools locally while also discovering DIY tutorials and resources. We focus on trust with verified profiles, user reviews, and local connections.We're also working on adding insurance options to better protect tool owners and renters, along with features like ID verification and deposits to reduce risk.If you\u2019re interested or have ideas, feel free to reach out at julien@patio.so \u2014 would love to chat!\n \nreply",
      "I feel like you need to make sure the rental side is the first thing people see.My initial reaction at being dumped on the \"Explore\" section was \"this is just a spammy pinterest style link aggregator thing\".\n \nreply",
      "Totally fair point \u2014 and really appreciate the honest feedback.Our goal is to build a platform where people can learn, educate, rent, and share tools within a community that loves DIY. The \u201cExplore\u201d section is part of our effort to surface great tutorials and ideas, but we hear you \u2014 the rental experience should be front and center.We\u2019re working on making that more clear from the start. Thanks again for the insight \u2014 it really helps us improve.\n \nreply",
      "Love the idea and hope you are successful. I really think there is a lot of value to be unlocked in sharing/renting tools. In my area we have a tool library which is handy.Some ideas: \n- I would focus a lot of effort on making it incredibly easy and intuitive to list things. This is one of the primary barriers to me when using these types of apps.\n- maybe future idea would be to list things from Home Depot or other stores to expand the number of rentals that are available.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks a lot for the feedback\u2014really appreciate it! Totally agree that ease of listing is key. We're actively working on making the process super simple with AI-powered automation, and also improving how people search and discover listings.

If your work, activism, or research demands rock-solid traffic isolation, oniux delivers it.Namespaces are an isolation feature found in the Linux kernel that were introduced around the year 2000. They provide a secure way of isolating a certain part of an application from the rest of the system. Namespaces come in various forms and shapes. Some examples include network namespaces, mount"

Example is that some GIS take coordinate input as LatLon and some take LonLat.Another good example is that very often when working with GIS you collate data from multiple sources, as a sibling comment indicates.

The \"XYZ\" axes of this frame are a NED frame (north, east, down)- an aircraft-local Cartesian frame with FRD (forward, right, down) axes- an interface that provides map tiles with zoom/x/y coordinates- a bunch of other sensors mounted on the aircraft that have their own FRD frames, except the camera which has an RDF (right, down, forward) frame because... reasons.- terrain RADAR units mounted on the aircraft at specific FRD locations that provide AGL (above ground level) measurements independent of their rotation (the aircraft can be 20 degrees nose-up and we still get a measurement straight down to the ground)- terrain LIDAR units mounted on the aircraft at specific FRD locations and orientations that provide a straight-line measurement to the ground - if we're over flat ground and the aircraft is 20 degrees nose-up, these report AGL/cos(20 deg)Keeping track of what frame everything is in is... a daunting task and we've definitely had bugs due to accidentally using a coordinate from the wrong frame. I've been deep into a bunch of this code this week and have been strongly considering doing a zero-cost abstraction similar to what Sguaba is doing, but for C++. I'm pretty sure that we could do it using templates and type tags without really changing any of the underlying math and without implementing a bunch of custom operators but I'm not 100% convinced of that yet.Another related issue that I don't think is addressed by Sguaba is time. We're hopefully going to get everything standardized to PTP timestamps everywhere but currently all of these sensors are running on unsynchronized clocks and we also have to be careful about keeping track of the origin of a given timestamp and making sure to convert it into the right scale before using it.\n \nreply",

You might have variables x1, y1, x2, y2. If y1 and y2 have a different type than x1 and x2, it's much harder to transpose them. Large flying vehicles often have many coordinate systems. Enforcing types will keep you from using stage 1 variables in a stage 2 context without type conversion.\n \nreply",

      "I'm super excited about this. Hope it gets moved to its own repo so it's easier to find and send to other people. I was always curious about math, and Tao's Analysis was the first textbook that really showed me how it can be constructed in a rigoruous way my programming brain was hoping for. Then I got a bit into Lean, and similarly it was very satisfying but Mathlib is a bit complicated to learn math concepts from. So it's nice to see a bridge from the book to the tool.\n \nreply",

If a student's proof is wrong, it simply won't compile.Previously, the only feedback students could receive would be from another human such as a TA, instructor, or other knowledgeable expert. Now they can receive rapid feedback from the Lean compiler.In the future I hope there is an option for more instructive feedback from Lean's compiler in the spirit of how the Rust compiler offers suggestions to correct code.

      "It will be incredibly interesting to assess how the mainstream \"textbook\" approach to the subject compares to the one taken in the Mathlib.  In general, formalized math libraries make it comparatively easier to state results with a maximum degree of generality and to refactor proof developments for straightforwardness and elegance.(Refactoring is of course made easier because the system will always keep track of what follows logically from what. You don't have that when working with pen and paper, so opportunities to rework things are very often neglected.)It is a natural question also to ask whether it makes sense to teach the Mathlib, \"maximum generality\" version of real analysis, or at least something approaching that, in an academic course.  Same for any other field of proof-based math, of course.\n \nreply",
      "Certainly not for introductory courses.

      "As a mathematician and also someone who has programmed for quite awhile I think any programmatic formalism will fail at inculcating the underlying understating. My bias of course is that I learned mathematical concepts via academic papers.I just feel that the overhead code presents is massive, since it often does not adhere to any semblance of style. I say say this as someone who has had to parse through other\u2019s mathematical papers that were deemed  incomprehensible. Code is 10x worse since there are virtually no standards with regards to comprehensibility.\n \nreply",
      "It's nice to see theorem proving gain some momentum in a mainstream mathematics topic such as analysis.In PLT, we already had a flagship book (The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages by Winskel) formally verified (kind of, it's not a 1-to-1 transcription) using Isabelle (http://concrete-semantics.org) back in the mid 2010s, when tools began to be very polished.IMHO, if someone is interested in theorem proving, that's a much simpler starting point. Theorems in analysis are already pretty hard on their own.\n \nreply",

I worked through some of the first parts of it and found it quite pleasant.\n \nreply",

      "I'm a PhD and researcher who has worked in various fields, including at a national lab.I think AI systems like this could greatly help with peer review, especially as a first check before submitting a manuscript to a journal.That said, this particular system appears to focus on the wrong issues with peer review, in my opinion.  I'll ignore the fact that an AI system is not a peer since another person already brought that up [1].  Even if this kind of system was a peer, the system appears to be checking superficial issues and not the deeper issues that many peer reviewer/referrers care about.  I'll also ignore any security risks (other posts discuss that too).A previous advisor of mine said that a good peer review needs to think about one major/deep question when reviewing a manuscript: Does the manuscript present any novel theories, novel experiments, or novel simulations; or does it serve as a useful literature review?Papers with more novelty are inherently more publishable.  This system does not address this major question and focuses on superficial aspects like writing quality, as if peer review is mere distributed editing and not something deeper.  It is possible for even a well-written manuscript to lack any novelty, and novelty is what makes it worthy of publication.  Moreover, many manuscripts have at best superficial literature reviews that name drop important papers and often mischaracterize their importance.It takes deep expertise in a subject to see how a work is novel and fits into the larger picture of a given field.  This system does nothing to aid in that.  Does it help identify what parts of a paper you should emphasize to prove its novelty?  That is, does it help you find the \"holes\" in the field that need patching?  Does it help show what parts of your literature review are lacking?A lot of peer review is kinda performative, but if we are going to create automated systems to help with peer review, I would like them to focus on the most important task of peer review: assessing the novelty of the work.(I will note that I have not tried out this particular system myself.  I am basing my comments here on the documentation I looked at on GitHub and the information in this thread.)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44144672\n \nreply",
      "I would say the exact opposite. Let the machine do the easy/simple/boring stuff. Let the human peer reviewer do the big question. That's what the human is good at and excited about and it's what the machine will not be good at. The question is a philosophical one: Is this a good idea? Is it relevant? Is it important? This is highly subjective and needs folks in the field to build consensus about. Back in my PhD days, I'd have loved if a machine could have taken care of the simple stuff so humans could focus entirely on the big questions.(A machine could point to similar work though.)\n \nreply",
      "You raise a good point overall.  I was just trying to respond to the idea of it replacing a human entirely, as if the authors submit it to the system and a journal editor has to made the decision to publish it or not.  I would love to focus more on the big picture stuff, but in my experience most peer reviews amount to \"Could you phrase this different?\" rather than \"Is this a good idea?\".  I think the latter is a much better better question to ask.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for the thoughtful feedback. That\u2019s very helpful.We didn\u2019t think too deeply about the term \u201cAI peer reviewer\u201d and didn\u2019t mean to imply it\u2019s equivalent to human peer review.

      "No worries, I appreciate that you took the time to read and respond!When I first read \"Originality and Contribution\" at [1], I actually assumed it was a plagiarism check.  It did not occur to me until now that you were referring to novelty with that.  Similarly, I assumed \"Impact and Significance\" referred to more about whether the subject was appropriate for a given journal or not (would readers of this journal find this information significant/relevant/impactful or should it be published elsewhere?).  That's a question that many journals do ask of referees, independent of overall novelty, but I see how you mean a different aspect of novelty instead.I'm not opposed to testing your system with a manuscript of my own, but currently the one manuscript that I have approaching publication is still in the internal review stage at my national lab, and I don't know precisely when it will be ready for external submission.

      "It is a real shame that peer review reports were only first published relatively recently. These would have provided valuable training information as to what peer review performs. Unfortunately now, I fully expect the public peer review reports will be poorer in quality, and oftentimes superficial.On this tool, I fully expect that it will not capture high level conceptual peer review, but could very much serve a role in identifying errors of omission from a manuscript as a checklist to improve quality (as long as this remains an author controlled process).I will be interested to throw in some of my own published papers to see if it catches all the things I know I would have liked to improve in my papers.\n \nreply",

In our experience, reviewer comments can be inconsistent or even unreasonable, yet authors often comply anyway to get past the gate.We're also working on a pre-submission screening tool that checks whether a manuscript meets hard requirements like formatting or scope for specific journals and conferences, hoping this will save a lot of time.Would love to hear your take on what kind of feedback you find useful, what feels like nonsense, and what you would want in an ideal review report... via this questionnaire https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EhQvw-HdGRqfL01jZaayoaiTWLS...\n \nreply",

Grisp have explored some really constrained hardware compared to the typical Nerves device.AtomVM is to my knowledge a lot of steps further down since they run a much lighter VM than the BEAM. It is also much less proven though.Nerves, Grisp and AtomVM all do some of the same things. They make some different trade-offs. Heck, Kry10 (proprietary but targets critical infra) even sort of approaches the same thing. Running Erlang/Elixir for resilient embedded systems.I am on the Nerves team so you can guess my preference. But all are cool. And we all talk to each other.

AtomVM supports a limited but functional subset of the BEAM opcodes, and also includes a small subset of the Erlang/OTP standard libraries, all optimized to run on tiny micro-controllers.  With AtomVM, you can write your IoT applications in a functional programming language, using a modern actor-based concurrency model, making them vastly easier to write and understand!AtomVM includes many advanced features, including process spawning, monitoring, message passing, pre-emptive scheduling, and efficient garbage collection.  It can also interface directly with peripherals and protocols supported on micro-controllers, such as GPIO, I2C, SPI, and UART.  It also supports WiFi networking on devices that support it, such as the Espress"

      "If the CNC machine is not connected to a network, and (I don't know much about CNC, but I do wonder) if one can provide a generic program, then just fill in the parameters before execution, right at the machine, the secret would be confined to just the CNC machine.Regardless, provided the CNC machine is not networked, and provided it doesn't have any solid state (only RAM), one could perhaps load a large job to overrite the previous one.Although, perhaps the CNC machine could be used to just provide templates, with small indentations for where the holes could be punched, and additional engraving to provide a link to a document on how to use the card in case of disaster recovery.\n \nreply",
      "Sometimes CNC machines are networked, sometimes not, but the idea behind saving keys like this is that you only generate the appropriate bits on disposable computers, e.g. a Raspberry Pi with an SD card you can then destroy.It depends on how much money you want to secure, of course, so YMMV.\n \nreply",
      "Nice! With a denser 256 bit card you could store an entire age secret key, and so encrypt any amount of data directly to metal key asymmetrically, only needing the public key at encryption time (keeps metal key safer).Then thresholding can be done with \"sops\" (which uses the Hashicorp vault shamir implementation) against groups of age keys.

      "Indeed, this is another use case I've had in mind.  (Protect a X25519 private key, and use the public key to encrypt against, without the need to have the private one online.)However, the current scheme supports only 128 bits, thus requiring two cards per X25519 secret key.  (One could of course, extend the sheet to another four blocks.)Alternatively, one could do either one of the following:* with the help of `age` (which uses X25519 keys), create a private / public key pair, and use a random secret as the private key password;* given how X25519 secret keys work (i.e. almost any 256 bit random number, after some tweaking would do), one can just create a random 128 bit number, backup like described here, then to get to a X25519 key, use something like `HMAC-SHA256(key=\"00bbcc...\", message=\"description of key\")` to get the cryptographic material for the X25519 key;  (thus one could have an infinite supply of X25519 keys, starting from just a simple 128 bit secret;)(This second scheme, might reduce the strength of the resulting X25519 keys, however I doubt they can be broken, given the requirement to brute-force the HMAC-SHA256.)\n \nreply",

Seems common in programmers. I don't understand the mechanism for it, but it would be great if we could figure out a way to prevent it, and teach that in schools. Too many people like this in the world today.\n \nreply",

      "Exactly.  By GP's logic, time zones are absolutist, and every town could & should observe solar noon independently.I think folks are averse to \"world time\" (for reasons, largely inertial), so maybe the baby step is try 1 timezone per country (like China's done for .. 75 years ?).I'd even argue Local Time has only ~4 useful times: dawn, daytime, dusk, & nighttime.    Where I grew up, the parks closed at dusk every day.  Nobody complainedIf I take a walk at 7:05:35 PM every day, it seems very precise but doesn't indicate whether I need sunglasses or a flashlight.  It's meaningless precision, like 0.6235 slices of pizza.  If I'm coordinating a walk with you, I might as well use UTC: it still won't tell light from dark, but at least nobody'll be waiting for an hour due to DST.  It'd make more sense to schedule our walk at `1 hour before dusk`, or \"just\" settle for UTC, IMO.\n \nreply",
      "> sun is most likely not halfway at noon for most of the zoneBeing able to express where you are in the 24-hour cycle is useful. That's what local time is: an approximation of the time since the last solar midnight.To the extent that the approximation is poor, it's an argument for improving it (Spain for example should really set their clocks back an hour), not for getting rid of it entirely.\n \nreply"
