      "I only read the first part of the article, but having dealt with Drive API scopes and their issues previously, I feel there is just a major misunderstanding here.The \"fully open\" Drive API read/write scopes should be highly restricted by default (because they essentially give you access to a user's entire drive), and these are the ones that Google added much more stringent security requirements a couple years ago, e.g. requiring a security audit.However, there is also a much less sensitive Drive API scope, 'drive.file', which is non-sensitive. It lets an app read and write only files the app owns (or read files a user picks through the file picker control).Thus, I don't understand why the ia.net app would require more than the drive.file scope. I have no doubt that Google's messaging wasn't clear on the transition process when they first created drive.file scope (and I personally wasted a ton of time with bugs in Google's own file picker when using that scope), but it is a much better solution.\n \nreply",
      "This is exactly right.I just finished the process to get drive.readonly for my app. It was a huge pain in the ass, and Google was not very helpful. Google recommends you pay $720 for a CASA lab assessment, which consists of some random dude in an apartment in SF running an open source script against a .zip of your codebase, then that guy emails Google saying you \"passed\".However, the goal is noble, to prevent malware and scam apps from accessing people's drives. It doesn't sound like the app from the article needs these more restricted scopes.\n \nreply",

      "Doesn't that mean that the app wouldn't be able to edit a document created elsewhere.Including documents created by their own web or desktop client.And it's odd that Google thinks that writing to files is significantly worse than reading.

      "Dang, hits home. When I was a senior in high school, I was lucky to able to volunteer under Dr. Eric Brown De Colstoun at NASA Goddard, checking error rates for tree cover estimates using Landsat data^. Many hours that fall spent trudging around parks and forests, looking at the sky through a PVC pipe. It still kind of blows my mind at how much is able to be gained from images where each pixel is 15mx15m of ground-level area (and, I believe, with an important component of Landsat 7's imaging system broken for most of its lifespan).I also wasn't aware that Landsat program imagery had been made free to access a few years later. Nice.^(A massive thank you to him, since I wouldn't have graduated without being able to participate in that project. And a massive apology for going on to get a fine arts degree.)\n \nreply",
      "It seems like a lot of these government-owned space things last a lot longer than they're made for.  There's Landsat, Spirit, Opportunity, Hubble, the Voyagers, et cetera. It seems to be a pretty steep curve - either they fail on launch or landing or very early, or they far outlast expectations. There seems to be little that meets expectations. I can see lots of failures - space stuff is hard - but why so many things exceeding it?\n \nreply",
      "> I can see lots of failures - space stuff is hard - but why so many things exceeding it?The design lifetime is treated as a minimum acceptable value; a vehicle which was designed to last 10 years but has a critical component fail at 9.5 would be considered a failure, for instance. This means that the average lifespan of the vehicle gets pushed out a lot further to ensure it meets its goals.With that being said, it's not uncommon for space vehicles to reach end-of-life for reasons other than a system failure - one common one being that a satellite or space probe runs out of propellant. Since the underlying mechanism there is predictable, rather than a random failure, there's much less margin needed.\n \nreply",
      "They build and design everything in a way that ensures a 99% chance that after successful launch and deployment it will last for the mission duration in a harsh and still somewhat unfamiliar environment. That happens to translate into a very high chance that it will still work after twice the mission duration, or ten times the mission duration.Part of this is cultural, part of it is political: nobody wants a failed mission, it's better for the image of the agency and the involved politician to spend a bit more money and underestimate the lifetime. Higher chance of success, and nobody complains if the mission can be extended afterwards.\n \nreply",
      "Because you set a min life, but statistics \naside, the design for that minimum life isn't usually something that can be tweaked on a continuous scale, but ends up being binned by design constraints.Eg, you need an industrial road with a 5-year lifespan over a swamp. To meet this minimum you actually have to build a bridge, which when built to industry standards, might start at lifespans of 20-30 yrs.Space is a bit different because of budgeting for ongoing operations, so you frontload the cap-x, knowing that asking for addl op-x funds later to extend the program will seem like a no-brainer deal.Plus sometimes it's as simple as: if you design something to statistically survive space launch, it results in something that is overdesigned to just sit in orbit for years (given that it survives that initial launch).It's similar to human lifespan statistics- if you get over the historical infant mortality hump, every adult seems 'overdesigned' compared to the historical expected lifespan.\n \nreply",

      "Interesting project for anyone who want to start learning lean and contribute to a project.The project as described in the article is to produce a graph (Poset) where each node is a law (say the commutativity equation for example) and each edge is either a proof of implication or a proof of a non-implication, since this graph is infinite the project limits the laws considered to up to 4 applications of the binary operator.The main goal is not the proofs themselves but experimenting in doing math in a matter that's more similar to software engineering in the open source community.The collaborative aspect of the project is to write a proof for each kind of edge (implication and not_implications) between the 4694 considered nodes.There's also the advantage that a GitHub CI running lean will be setup to automatically check if the pull requests adding theses edges are right or wrong without the need for a human to do the checking of the proofs in their head.partial visualization of the (WIP) graph: https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/0e67dad3b...outline of the project: https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/github repo: https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories\n \nreply",

      "Usually when we have something like numbers (objects) and something like addition (an operation) we're accustomed to getting various rules that apply.For example,a + b = b + aAlso,a + (b + c) = (a + b) + cThese work for addition and in fact for many other things we can do with numbers that we care about. But mathematicians also study objects and operations where some of these rules don't apply.A somewhat famous example is about rotating physical objects in space. In that case, it matters what order you do the rotations in (\"turn and flip\" doesn't end up the same as \"flip and turn\"!). So if \"a\" and \"b\" referred to rotations in space and \"+\" referred to doing them one after another, thena + b \u2260 b + ain some cases.Universal algebra is about thinking about all of these kinds of rules and how they relate to each other, for any kind of objects and any kinds of operations. So numbers are one kind of object and addition is one kind of operation, but there can be infinitely many kinds of objects and infinitely many kinds of operations, and some will follow certain patterns and others won't.But in some cases, objects and operations that follow certain patterns (sometimes called \"laws\") automatically have to follow other patterns.To take one example, ifa + b = b + aanda + (b + c) = (a + b) + cthen it is necessarily also true thata + b + c = c + b + aSome of these patterns have been very extensively studied because they recur over and over again, or because they apply to things like numbers (and rotations) that we care about a lot in relation to things we frequently encounter in life (and mathematics and computer science). But other patterns may be obscure and not that well-studied.If you hypothesize some laws about ways of combining objects, you might ask which other laws are necessarily implied (or necessarily impossible) as a result of those laws. Tao noted that there are actually thousands of simple-to-state laws and so a research project is to figure out the logical status of how all of them relate to all of the others. Which ones require others to be true? Which ones prevent others from being true? Which ones are independent of others, so they might be true or not?There are some charts about familiar classifications of these structures according to certain lawshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)#Types_of_magmabut Tao is sort of suggesting that this classification is just getting started, and we can learn a lot more about how structures relate to each other.I should note that he is limiting this to \"equational axioms\" which means that he's not considering some of the kinds of rules that are often considered in such studies (those containing constants, not just variables). For example, when dealing with numbers and addition there is a number 0, which doesn't change other numbers when added to it. This fact causes lots and lots of nice theorems about arithmetic to work out. There is similarly a \"non-rotation\" in rotations which doesn't change the position of objects when you \"rotate\" them by not moving them. That also causes some of the same theorems that would apply to arithmetic with numbers to apply in that case!Tao's project is, at least for the time being, not considering rules like \"there is an object that doesn't cause a change when applied to other objects\" (the \"law of identity\", which is represented by a downwards blue arrow in that Wikipedia article). These rules are important in mathematics, but I guess it's more complicated to consider how they do or don't relate to one another, so this project will simply ignore them, and only consider laws that can be stated only with variables.Does that help a bit?I guess another point is just that it's been very common in mathematics to try to consider things at higher and higher levels of abstraction, in order to find theorems that work for many different situations. For instance, Boolean algebra like in computer logic has objects 0 and 1, and operations OR and AND (and perhaps XOR). It turns out that we can interpret Boolean algebra with XOR and AND as a previously-discovered mathematical structure called a finite fieldhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Values... whereupon tons of theorems about fields immediately automatically apply to Boolean algebra, even though perhaps those theorems weren't originally conceived of as relating to Boolean logic at all. So part of universal algebra is like \"if we prove as much as we can with as few assumptions as possible, we can discover results that will readily apply to lots of new situations in the future\". What Tao is proposing to do is a part of that undertaking, again at a super-high level of generality.\n \nreply"

      "I was hoping it would talk about the most important tipping points, the climate ones, but unfortunately it does not.\n \nreply",
      "Interesting read. It puts into context the importance of luck in life. There is a group of people who become oppressed to the point that it becomes unbearable and they have a choice either to die by revolting too early without critical mass, or by letting themselves starve from the increasing weight of the oppression. In the case of the opioid epidemic, people have been/are driven to insanity and commit suicide by drug overdose.You really don't want to be in that early oppressed group.IMO, it's because human systems are over-systematized and over-regulated. It always causes oppression. Some group of people has to pay dearly for all the structures that are imposed on them. Laws and social structures essentially never work for everyone equally; at scale, many laws systematically steal wealth, power and opportunities from one group and give it to another.Even the most well-meaning laws basically end up stealing from certain groups of people for the benefit of others. Especially on a complex global playing field. Just look at Africa. It's not their fault that they're stuck in poverty... Western powers keep installing corrupt dictators by sponsoring coups. The dictators then saddle their citizens with debt. The people have little say. Then basically they become so poor that they are forced to immigrate to the rich countries which are causing the problems... And for the most part, join the lower class of that society where the oppression continues under a different form.They get to be oppressed in this slightly different way while also contributing to the continued oppression of their people back in their home countries through the gift their cheap labor to their oppressors in their new country, which enriches them. This is made possible by a combination of ignorance and intergenerational low self-esteem inflicted upon them by their oppressors as a result of manipulation of the political systems of their previous countries.IMO, US leftwing politics are extremely short sighted with their approach to immigration because they are building a critical mass of oppressed people in the US. Some people will be grateful initially but the gratefulness will soon turn to disdain once the new reality sinks in.\n \nreply",
      "That makes a lot of sense, well thought! The only thing I would like to add is regarding the critical mass of oppressed people in the US, at least when it comes to immigrants. I think the first generation struggles the most, but their children, who are raised - if not born - in the country face less issues, and things then improve from one generation to the other.Granted, for generations there will be a difference between their standard of living and the one from their non-immigrant counterparts on average, but that gradual reduction might be enough to avoid reaching the tipping point.\n \nreply",

      "I\u2019m confused by this news story and the response here. No one seems to understand OpenAI\u2019s corporate structure or non profits at all.My understanding: OpenAI follows the same model Mozilla does. The nonprofit has owned a for-profit corporation called OpenAI Global, LLC that pays taxes on any revenue that isn\u2019t directly in service of their mission (in a very narrow sense based on judicial precedent) since 2019 [1]. In Mozilla\u2019s case that\u2019s the revenue they make from making Google the default search engine and in OpenAI\u2019s case that\u2019s all their ChatGPT and API revenue. The vast majority (all?) engineers work for the for-profit and always have. The vast majority (all?) revenue goes through the for-profit which pays taxes on that revenue minus the usual business deductions. The only money that goes to the nonprofit tax-free are donations. Everything else is taxed at least once at the for-profit corporation. Almost every nonprofit that raises revenue outside of donations has to be structured more or less this way to pay taxes. They don\u2019t get to just take any taxable revenue stream and declare it tax free.All OpenAI is doing here is decoupling ownership of the for-profit entity from the nonprofit. They\u2019re allowing the for profit to create more shares and distribute them to entities other than the non-profit. Or am I completely misinformed?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#2019:_Transition_from_n...\n \nreply",

One could rationally call this power-hungry but one could also rationally call this just helicopter parenting of a tech you've helped built.

      "It can become a compulsion to record and collect media. Seems like a male thing, normally it's blokes who create these archives.I met a bloke once in the 90's who made recordings on to C-90 tapes of anything interesting that was on BBC Radio 4 and 3, and he found most things interesting. He was surrounded by piles, thousands of tapes everywhere and he was desperately trying to catalog everything. As I spoke to him he was listening to the radio via an ear bud, whilst also recording the radio. He was supposed to be moving out of his house that day, having just exchanged contacts, but he was drowning in his precious tapes. His wife seemed pretty p**d off with him.I was a bit compulsive myself. I used to buy records, then CDs, and I also made tapes of albums, and recordings of the John Peel show. It was a problem to shift 100s of records and CDs and boxes of tapes whenever I moved house. I lightened my load by giving everything away apart from the Peel tapes which were the most entertaining items in the whole collection, it actually felt good. I kept hold of the Peel tapes for some years, even though my tape deck had died. There were some great shows from the 90s!

      "So, Florida mortgage-related financial gambling is about to explode again? That only took 16 years...>> Using Florida as a case study,\nwe show that traditional insurers are exiting high risk areas, and new lower quality insurers are entering and filling the gap. These new insurers service the riskiest areas, are less diversified, hold less capital, and 20 percent of them become insolvent. We trace their growth to a lax insurance regulatory environment.>> We find that these new insurers would not meet [government-sponsored enterprise] eligibility thresholds if subjected to traditional rating agencies\u2019 methodologies. We then examine the implications of these dynamics for mortgage markets. We show that lenders respond to the decline in insurance quality by selling a large portion of exposed loans to the GSEs.As a former resident, this is comically on-brand for Florida (and granted, some other regulatory-captured states): allow business to do as it will, ignoring systemic problems, and then when the risk dice finally come up snake eyes exclaim \"No one could have possibly seen this coming!\"\n \nreply",

One of the most interesting feats is that Microsoft shifted the game\u2019s computing from your local PC to the cloud, said Jorg Neumann, head of Microsoft Flight Simulator, in an interview. The massive amounts of data are computed in the internet-connected data centers and then streaming in real-time to the user\u2019s machine, where the simulation is visualized onscreen. In the 2020 version, Microsoft had a hybrid structure that streamed data from the cloud and also used the local compute resources on the user\u2019s own machine. That resulted in download"

      "libgen and z-library must be Russia's greatest philanthropic contribution to the rest of mankind (despite all the other dodgy stuff it is involved in, which I am not belittling).It was a no brainer for them from a strategic point of view: knock out a hugely profitable business (textbook publishing) of you adversary while increasing your soft power by 100x due to the unpopularity of said industry.There are surely loads of artists and independent technical authors who got screwed by it which I am not diminishing, but this is more than dwarfed by the benefit to the hundred of millions around the world especially from developing countries who can't afford to pay $100+ for a textbook on essential topic like organic chemistry or electrical engineering. In fact even if you want to pay this much sometimes it is the only place to find an out of date scientific book (which I needed to do often in mathematics) that is not being published due to lack of demand while at the same time the publisher refuses to submit the book to the open domain.\n \nreply",
      "I think you\u2019re overstating how much anyone knows or cares that Libgen is Russian (if that is a correct categorization). Also, as you imply, the hurt to publishers may be overstated - a download is not a lost sale.\n \nreply",
      "While the founders may have their origins in the Soviet Union (and not Russian), I don\u2019t think the site has anything todo with the Russian government. Rather, it\u2019s the reaction of some individuals to the difficult and expensive access to literature in the west.\n \nreply",
      "As a Russian, I agree in the part that it seems extremely unlikely our government would even think about doing something like this. (Wikipedia says it started explicitly in 1990\u2019s RuNet though, which I am inclined to believe.)\n \nreply",
      "Yes this has been a misdirection from the publishers for a while that even some librarians are repeating (other things are supposedly stolen credentials used to do more than just getting access to publications).\n \nreply",
      "A further issue that\u2019s often overlooked in English-language discussion is Russian-language books.A lot of specialist scientific literature such as monographs only saw a single run of 300, 1000, or at best 3000 copies in the Soviet Union, and that\u2019s it. If you\u2019d missed it and didn\u2019t have access to one of a handful of libraries that had it, tough luck. (To give an idea of what counts as specialist, the foremost textbook on general relativity, Gravitation by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, was translated into Russian in 1977 and had a single 3000-copy print run. The 1973 English original is still in print.)Furthermore, when the Soviet Union fell, so for the most part did the publishing houses, and nobody knows where the offset printing films for the books went. So nobody can print Soviet books again without typesetting them from scratch, even those that weren\u2019t rare. (Did you know that the new Russian edition of Gradshtein and Ryzhik\u2019s special functions manual is technically a translation from Russian to English to Russian? Or so it says on the copyright page, anyway.)In that environment, having widely available scans of books was absolutely vital; for those who teach students fresh out of high school who don\u2019t necessarily know enough English, it still is. Today\u2019s LibGen arose as an amalgamation of a number of those efforts from the early days of the Russian-speaking Internet.One was maintained (unofficially) by people from the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics of the Moscow State University. Another was mirrored (unofficially) by a Moscow-based particle physics institute that until recently originated a large part of the Russian presence at CERN. I\u2019m sure other Russian-speaking research centers contributed just as much or more, I\u2019m just not familliar with that part of the history.As Russian-language scientific publishing stagnated, and subscriptions to English-language literature by and large did not materialize (what with them costing most of a typical money-starved institute\u2019s budget), obtaining scanned and ebook versions of English-language literature from Western acquaintances became more important. People gradually unified under LibGen\u2019s banner, and here we are.And yes, none of this ever got government support, as far as I know.\n \nreply",
