      "> Using UUIDv7 is generally discouraged for security when the primary key is exposed to end users in external-facing applications or APIs. The main issue is that UUIDv7 incorporates a 48-bit Unix timestamp as its most significant part, meaning the identifier itself leaks the record's creation time... Experts recommend using UUIDv7 only for internal keys and exposing a separate, truly random UUIDv4 as an external identifier.So this basically defeats the entire performance improvement of UUIDv7. Because anything coming from the user will need to look up a UUIDv4, which means every new row needs to create an extra random UUIDv4 which gets inserted into a second B-tree index, which recreates the very performance problem UUIDv7 is supposedly solving.In other words, you can only use UUIDv7 for rows that never need to be looked up by any data coming from the user. And maybe that exists sometimes for certain data in JOINs... but it seems like it might be more the exception than the rule, and you never know when an internal ID might need to become an external one in the future.reply",
      "This is only really true if leaking the creation time of the record is itself a security concern.reply",
      "It's relatively common for it to be a privacy concern. Imagine if I'm making an online payment or something, and one of the IDs involved tells you exactly when I created my bank account. That's a decent proxy for my age.reply",
      "Which I have to assume is rare, right?reply",
      "We used to leak approximate creation time all the time back when everyone used sequential keys. If anything sequential keys are far worse: they leak the approximate number of records, make it easy to observe the rate at which new keys are created, and once you know that you can deduce the approximate creation date of any key.UUIDv4 removes all three of those vectors. UUIDv7 still removes two of three. It doesn't leak record count or the rate at which you create them, only creation time. And you still can't guess adjacent keys. It's a pretty narrow information leakage for something you routinely reveal on purpose.reply",
      "UUIDv7s are much worse for creation time though imo. For sequential IDs an attacker needs to be have a lot of data to narrow the creation time. That raises the barrier of entry considerably to the point that only a committed attacker could infer the time.With UUIDv7 the creation time is always leaked without any sampling. A casual attacker could quite easily lookup the time and become motivated in probing and linking the account furtherreply",
      "It seems wildly paranoid, even for securitt researchers.reply",
      "There are some practical applications that are not necessarily related to security. If you are storing something like a medical record, you don't want use it as a public ID for a patient visit, because the date is subject to HIPAA.reply",
      "But they would have to relate that ID to patient data like their identity right?  The date alone cannot be a HIPAA issue.  That means every date is a HIPAA violation because people go to the doctor every day.reply",
      "it's not about the individual record, it's about correlating records. if you can sequence everything in time it gets a lot easier to deanonymize datareply"

      "I read political books from the 70s and everything is the same.  It's been the same since the mid-60s.  That's when the western narrative shifted from technological progress to environmentalism and the lawyer took over from the engineer as the prime mover in society.  That was 60 years ago.  60 years before that was 1900 and the world was vastly vastly different compared to our world of the 1960s.  60 years before that was 1840 and the world was vastly vastly different.I'm thinking that AI,robots and the rise of China is going to change things radically.  Human labor will not be an economic constraint, but that won't lead to unlimited abundance because the constraint will be externalities.Most of the technologically unemployed will wake up and do whatever AI tells them to do on a daily basis.  Their lives will improve because AI is better than they are naturally at everything.  This will lead to some weird outcomes. Especially if AI is not acting in the interest of each individual, but in the interests of the collective.  This will cause AI to have to solve trolley problems.reply",
      "For anyone new to Charlie Stross' fiction, here are a few links for your perusal:Stross' 2005 novel Accelerando [1] set around the technological singularity, is made freely available by the authorIn addition to various standalone science fiction novels, Stross also has a couple of long series, the Laundry Files and Merchant Princes / Empire Games.The setting of the Laundry Files is a mix of magic as a branch of applied math, UK secret service bureaucracy and lovecraftian horror. Stross' laundry files novella \"Down on the Farm\" is available to read here [2].Stross' early novelette A Colder War, published in 2000, can be read here [3].The Merchant Princes series is also a great yarn. The setup is that parallel universes with alternate history Earths exist, and tech journalist Miriam discovers she belongs to a bloodline who can \"jaunt\" into a parallel medieval Earth. One thing Stross does well is applying the science fictional / economic lens of \"OK, so if that were true, then what happens?\", so instead of simple fantasy tale we get an exploration of stuff like the transdimensional narco-courier-for-guns trade, or what would Rumsfeld do if transdimensional narcoterrorists made a severe error of judgement and picked a fight with the US?

      "We're doing something like this internally.  Our monorepo context files were much too big, so we built a progressive tree of fragments to load up for different tasks.I am struck by how much these kinds of context documents resemble normal developer documentation, but actually useful and task-oriented.  What was the barrier to creating these documents before?Three theories on why this is so different:1) The feedback loop was too long.  If you wrote some docs, you might never learn if they were any good.  If you did, it might be years later.  And if you changed them, doing an A/B test was impractical.  Now, you can write up a context markdown, ask Claude to do something, and iterate in minutes.2) The tools can help build them.  Building good docs was always hard.  Especially if you take the time to include examples, urls, etc. that make the documentation truly useful.  These tools reduce this cost.3) Many programmers are egotists.  Documentation that helps other people doesn't generate internal motivation.  But documentation that allows you to better harness a computer minion to your will is attractive.Any other theories?reply",
      "It is primarily a principal agent problem, with a hint of marshmallow test.If you are a developer who is not writing the documents for consumption by AI, you are primarily writing documents for someone who is not you; you do not know what this person will need or if they will ever even look at them.They may, of course, help you, but you may not understand that, have the time, or discipline.If you are writing them because the AI using them will help you, you have a very strong and immediate incentive to document the necessary information. You also have the benefit of a short feedback loop.Side note, thanks to the LLMs penchant of wiping out comments, I have a lot more docs these days and far fewer comments.reply",

      "In life, it helps to be skeptical, so the real question is where do I find real life humans to ask about their experiences? And even then, they could still be paid actors. Though, I've often wondered how would that work. Like, the marketing department staffed by hot people finds developers and then offers to Venmo them $500 to write something nice online about the product? It's a big Internet, and there's a lot of people on Upwork, so I'm not saying it isn't happening, but I've never gotten an email asking me to write something nice about Claude Code in exchange for a couple of bucks.reply",
      "In my experience gpt5-codex (medium) and codex-cli is notably better than Sonnet 4.5 and claude-code.\n(note: never tried Opus)It is slower, but the results are much more often correct and it doesn't rush into half-baked solutions/dumb approaches as eagerly.I'd much rather wait 5 minutes than have to clean up manually or try to coax a model into doing things differently.I also wouldn't be surprised if the slowness was partially due to OpenAI being quite resource constrained. They are repeatedly complaining about not having sufficient compute.Bigger picture: I think all the AI coding environments are incredibly immature. There are many improvements to be unlocked.reply",
      "That\u2019s falsifiable quite easily by measuring tokens per second.Rather, the real reason codex takes longer is that it does more work to read more context.IMO the results are much better with codex, not even closereply",
      "Where codex falls short is in background processing, both running a daemon in the background and using its output as context while simultaneously being interactive for the user, and with subagents, ie, do multiple things in parallel. Presumably codex will catch up, but for now, that puts Claude Code ahead of things for me.As far as which one is better, it's highly dependent on what we're each doing, but I will say that I have this one project where bare \"make\" won't work, and I have a script that needs to be run instead. I have instructions to call that script in multiple .md files, and codex is able to call the script instead of make, but it keeps forgetting that and tries to run make which fails and it gets confused. (Claude code running on macOS host but build on Linux vm.) I could work around it, but that really takes the \"shiny\" factor off of codex+GPT-5 for me.reply",
      "If you want to compare Codex and Claude Code side by side you can do it in Crystal in worktrees from one prompt https://github.com/stravu/crystalreply",
      "Notice how pricing is the top discussion theme. People love free shit and it's hard to deny codex usage limits are more generous. My 2c for someone who uses both tools pretty consistently in an enterprise context:- Codex-medium is better if you have a well articulated plan you \"merely\" need to execute on, need help finding a bug, have some specific complex piece of logic you need to tweak, truly need a ton of long range context to reason about an issue. It's great and usage limits are very generous!- Sonnet 4.5 is better for everything else. That means for me: non-coding CLI ops, git ops, writing code with it as a pair programmer, OOD tasks, big new chunks of functionality that are highly conceptual, architectural discussion, etc. I generally approve every edit and often interrupt it. The fast iteration and feedback is key.I probably use CC 80% of the time with Codex the other 20%. My company pays for CC and I don't even look at the cost. Most of my coworkers use CC over Codex. We do find the Codex PR reviewer to be the best of any tool out there.Codex gets a lot of play on twitter also because a lot of the most prolific voices there are solo devs who are \"building in public\". A greenfield, solo project is the ideal (only?) use case for running 5 agents in parallel or whatever. Codex is probably amazing at that. But it's not practical for building in enterprise contexts IMO.reply"

      "Measuring oneself as an engineer by the title of the salary band you're in is a disservice.I remember at Bell Labs they had one title: MTS (Member of Technical Staff). You were an engineer, and that was that. (disclaimer: there were a handful of DMTSes (Distinguished Member of Technical Staff)).No one said, \"I'm an E7\" or \"I'm a Staff Engineer II\". Those statements strike me as distasteful. And begs the question if we're being suckered by Human Resource's gamification of work.I worked at a company, Pivotal Labs, where everyone's title was \"Pivot\". It made for an egalitarian workplace. That changed after the acquisition, and we got titles. My proudest moment? Not when I was promoted from Senior Engineer to Staff Engineer, but rather the after-hours work I did with Dimtriy to expand our offering to include IPv6.At my current startup, there are no titles, and I'm grateful for that.reply",

Ok that's like saying my most gratifying experience at school was not when I graduated but when I had to sit in detention.

Comparing yourself to those around you is human nature, but here you're asking us to compare ourselves to what we imagine is the peak of ourselves in order to stay realistic.

But if you know what it takes to go from E5 to E6, I think going from E6 to E9 is smooth sailing (provided you find wind in your sails).But by then the marginal utility of a promotion starts dropping sharply.

This line is taught to every first-year English law student.Initially this seems like disrespect for another country's sovereignty. But really the crucial thing is:> We explained to the UK that the Online Safety Act had a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of being enforced in the United StatesOfcom has to go through the motions of telling 4chan they can't smoke in Paris because of the (very on-brand) nanny law.reply",
      "Not quite.Ofcom in their reply make their point clear: \"The [Online Safety] Act explicitly grants Ofcom the legal authority to regulate online safety for individuals in the United Kingdom [...]\"They are stating that companies operating in the UK and providing services to UK individuals, are required to conform with UK regulations in relation to those services, under UK law.As an American business, you can choose to ignore that, but that has consequences if any of your board of directors ever sets foot in the UK.The US does this, and US lawyers understand this. If I open an online poker and sports bookmaking site in the UK (where such sites are completely legal), and take business from all over the United States thereby breaking federal law, I can expect to be met at the plane door the next time I take a shopping trip to NYC. Arguing that my servers and my business are located in the UK is not going to impress the federal judge I'd appear in front of in the morning. Stating the US laws against my activities have a snowball's chance in hell of being enforced in the UK is surely going to risk me being charged with contempt.The Online Safety Act is ridiculous on many levels, but in the same way that Google does certain things in relation to Tiananmen Square searches in China, and every tech company engages in regulatory alignment for the entire Middle East, the UK has asked that US companies do certain things in the jurisdiction of the UK. I'd argue, less harmful and egregious things in some respects.Should the UK do this? No, probably not. I think it will just make VPN software vendors richer, and UK citizens - particularly children - barely any safer.Are Ofcom claiming jurisdiction in the US? No, they're claiming jurisdiction in the UK. Which, I hasten to add they are legally required to do by the Online Safety Act, by the government they are an agency of. If they didn't, the government would literally be breaking its own law.TIL that 4chan's lawyer is about as grown up, mature and able to engage in critical thinking about the law as the people who post on his client's site.reply",

      "I think the premise of this is simple, and a lot of people seem to not be understanding this...The UK can make a law and apply it however they see fit. 4Chan is providing a service to UK people (a website you can access) and is not implementing the law. Ultimately the UK cannot enforce this law until money destined to/from 4Chan passes through the UK or people associated with the site visit UK territories.In practicality this law for the most part will just mean either websites block the UK or UK ISPs are forced to block websites.But this law was designed for the websites and platforms that will not be willing to do that as they make money off of UK citizens, such as Amazon/Facebook/Youtube/etc.If a website blocks UK users then the law doesn't apply as it is only concerned with protecting UK citizens. If a foreign company was shipping drugs or guns to UK children, or your choice of obvious contraband, then why wouldn't it have the power to hold that entity accountable? This is how it has always worked and I am not seeing why this is a problem just because it's in the digital space.reply",
      "Putting the burden on site operators to geoblock UK users is not only placing an incredible burden on individual operators, it doesn't even work.It is not the responsibility of foreign companies to enforce or even acknowledged the UK's laws. If the UK has a problem, they have tools to solve it on their own soil. If they want to enforce their laws they need to pay for it.The UK is trying to bully and scare foreign website operators regardless of scale or type of business into paying to enforce UK laws outside of the UK.If they want a website blocked, the only way to make that work is to block it and pay for it themselves.reply",
      "> why wouldn't it have the power to hold that entity accountable?Literally because the entity is not under the jurisdiction of the UK. The UK can force domestic companies to block the website but they cant force the website itself to do anything. The claims of fines against 4chan are therefore nonsensical.

      "Are LLM\u2019s capable of time travel because it looks it also created all these cookie cutter websites in 2013reply",
      "Your comment makes me wonder.  Probably lots of 2013 websites in the training data.Also makes me wonder... will self-driving car training data be less and less based on human driving, and more based on how all the other self-driving cars behave?reply",

      "I vibe coded the site for pxehost - https://pxehost.comThe text content is largely hand written but the style/structures/etc are vibes.Codex CLI on the $20 plus planThe first shot was remarkably similar to the end result, but there was lots of tweaking and testing.reply",
      "You really bury the lede that this software runs a DHCP server.  Folks could really mess up their network running it on their local machine, you should add a warning somewhere.  How does it determine the default gateway or DNS to advertise?reply",
      "It\u2019s not a DHCP server the way you\u2019re thinking. Pxehost only replies with a couple fields for PXE boot, and only to clients that are declaring themselves as PXE boot client. It doesn\u2019t interfere with the normal dhcp server - the PXE client will get 2 broadcast replies, one from pxehost and one from the dhcp server, and will combine the inforeply",
      "That looks great for presumably a couple of hours of work, and it showcases pxehost pretty well.reply",
      "Honestly that's a great case for vibe coding, getting a splash page for a project that's not a website.reply",
      "You forgot to include some vulnerabilities. It just doesn't feel complete to me.Jokes aside, I'm not mentioning who, but right on the front page of a popular vibe coding platform you can see a bunch of promoted real-world projects and almost all of them have some gaping security hole - and I'm not referring to the click-jacking kind.reply"

Built entirely by copy-pasting Claude responses without reading them!\n                    Lovingly crafted by Claude while Jimmy K  stood by and took all the credit to farm X followers.\n                Forget that! Who would ever want to put in all of that effort to understand what they're building? Just open up your browser and type \"make me a website\" into Claude or ChatGPT, and you're on your way! There are hundreds of identical prompts to choose from, but go ahead and use the same exact one everyone else uses, paste the output without reading it, and you're done! No one will notice that every AI-coded site looks identical! Plus you get to argue on Twitter about whether \"prompt engineering\" counts as real programming!Why understand your own code when Claude can hallucinate it for you? Just keep hitting \"regenerate\" until something works!We use the revolutionary technique of copying code we d"
