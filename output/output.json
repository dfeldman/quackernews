      "Perhaps related, after watching a talk by Gerald Sussman I loaded an image of the Kanizsa triangle into Claude and asked it a pretty vague question to see if it could \u201csee\u201d the inferred triangle. It recognised the image and went straight into giving me a summary about it. So I rotated the image 90 degrees and tried in a new conversation, it didn\u2019t recognise the image and got the number of elements incorrect:This image shows a minimalist, abstract geometric composition with several elements:Four black shapes that appear to be partial circles or \"Pac-Man\" like forms, each with a wedge cut out, positioned in the four corners/quadrants of the image\nTwo thin black triangular or arrow-like shapes - one pointing upward in the upper left area, and one pointing to the right in the center-right area\nAll elements are arranged on a light gray or off-white background\n \nreply",
      "I guess they will now just rotate all the images in the training data 90 degrees too to fill this kind of gap.\n \nreply",
      "Everything old is new again: in the Alexnet paper that kicked off the deep learning wave in 2012, they describe horizontally flipping every image as a cheap form of data augmentation. Though now that we expect models to actually read text that seems potentially counter-productive. Rotations are similar, in that you'd hope it would learn heuristics such as that the sky is almost always at the top.\n \nreply",
      "Interesting. Even the most recent models perform relatively poorly when asked to identify which information in a context has been removed, given access to both the original and edited contexts.The authors posit that poor performance is due to the fact that the attention mechanism of Transformers cannot attend to the removed tokens, because there are no keys for them!Thank you for sharing on HN.\n \nreply",
      "And yet, there are some notable differences between them, so now that there\u2019s a benchmark and attention given to this issue, I wonder how much better they can get. Because obviously something can be done.\n \nreply",
      "for vision models, I wonder if they can train on things like photo negatives, rotated images, etc. Or madlib like sentences where a Q/A is like \"the _____ took first place in the horse show.\"\n \nreply",
      "The madlib like sentences approach is actually how masked token prediction works! It was one of the pretraining tasks for BERT, but nowadays I think all (?) LLMs are trained with next token prediction instead.\n \nreply",
      "To detect a presence, a real brain takes in sensory input and compares it to expectations, and stays calm or registers surprise, and from time to time issues predictions to guide the organism.To detect an absence, the brain cannot rely on sensory input, by definition. To be surprised if sensory evidence is _not_ there requires a model of the world  strong enough to register surprise if the expectation is not there, without a sensory prompt.It seems to me detecting an absence is a strictly higher-order neurological task than processing sensory input.If LLMs can't do this strictly higher-order neurological task, is that not a capability currently unique to living things?\n \nreply",
      "This is very interesting.\n1. Authors mention the attention mechanism being perhaps unable to attend to the location of gaps since the gaps aren't tokens. But I would've expected a good LLM transformer to be at least a bit close to the gap location. I don't understand why mathematically the architecture is less suitable for that, it could attend to a region that may contain gaps. I wonder if fine-tuning on a task like this could help?\n2. Shorter inputs with less omissions were harder to solve. That is not completely surprising, as a human doing this task, if 1 word was missing it would be harder to notice. And similarly 1 line would be harder than 10 lines. But still interesting for an LLM to have this problem.\n3. Reasoning models do better, as they can write out the documents and potentially solve this easily. It still very surprising that this doesn't lead to 100% accuracy. This should be a trivial task. Like the paper says, a trivial program can be written to solve this. Perhaps ChatGPT (or similar agent) could read this paper while training, and know to write and run python when solving an issue like this.The most interesting thing though, is what other aspects of intelligence we may not have identified explicitly, and whether LLMs and current AI is very bad at them. This paper suggests that there likely are many of those, and it seems in general a pretty fun time for people working building benchmarks.\n \nreply",
      "I haven't read the paper yet, but from a structural 'attention' perspective being unable to detect unclassified omissions is completely expected. (Though I think it is can be solved with structured thought.)For needle in a haystack you have to pay attention to the thing that you are trying to find. Attention can do this pretty well.When looking for an omission, that omission can be anything, you can only reason about it by comparing one whole context to another whole context. The attention layers can't really do that.This is similar to the \"rank a long set of things\" problem. Absent some meta cognition process, they just can't do that.\n \nreply"

      "This is very cool. I think the primary innovation here is twofold:1. Remote agent - it's a containerized environment where the agent can run loose and do whatever - it doesn't need approval for user tasks because it's in an isolated environment (though it could still accidentally do destructive actions like edit git history). I think this alone is a separate service that needs to be productionized. When I run claude code in my terminal, automatically spin up the agent in an isolated environment (locally or remotely) and have it go wild. Easy to run things in parallel2. Deep integration with fly. Everyone will be trying to embed AI deep into their product. Instead of having to talk to chatgpt and copy paste output, I should be able to directly interact with whatever product I'm using and interact with my data in the product using tools. In this case, it's deploying my web app\n \nreply",

      "Amazing work.Just a clarifying question since I'm confused by the branding use of \"Phoenix.new\" (since I associate \"Phoenix\" as a web framework for Elixir apps but this seems to be a lot more than that).- Is \"Phoenix.new\" an IDE?- Is \"Phoenix.new\" ... AI to help you create an app using the Phoenix web framework for Elixir?- Does \"Phoenix.new\" require the app to be hosted/deployed on Fly.io? If that's the case, maybe a naming like \"phoenix.flyio.new\" would be better and extensible for any type of service Fly.io helps in deployment - Phoenix/Elixir being one)- Is it all 3 above?And how does this compare to Tidewave.ai (created as presumably you know, by Elixir creator)Apologies if I'm possibility conflating topics here.\n \nreply",
      "Yes all 3. It has been weird trying to position/brand this as we started out just going for full-stack Elixir/Phoenix and it became very clear this is already much bigger than a single stack. That said, we wanted to nail a single stack super well to start and the agent is tailored for vibe'd apps atm. I want to introduce a pair mode next for more leveled assistance without having to nag it.You could absolutely treat phoenix.new as your full dev IDE environment, but I think about it less an IDE, and more a remote runtime where agents get work done that you pop into as needed. Or another way to think about it, the agent doesn't care or need the vscode IDE or xterm. They are purely conveniences for us meaty humans.For me, something like this is the future of programming. Agents fiddling away and we pop in to see what's going on or work on things they aren't well suited for.Tidewave is focused on improving your local dev experience while we sit on the infra/remote agent/codex/devin/jules side of the fence. Tidewave also has a MCP server which Phoenix.new could integrate with that runs inside your app itself.\n \nreply",

      "The Phoenix.new environment includes a headless Chrome browser that our agent knows how to drive. Prompt it to add a front-end feature to your application, and it won\u2019t just sketch the code out and make sure it compiles and lints. It\u2019ll pull the app up itself and poke at the UI, simultaneously looking at the page content, JavaScript state, and server-side logs.Is it possible to get that headless Chrome browser + agent working locally?

      "FP6:  \"Alan: Sure, yep, so one of the things that we felt like on MI350 in this  timeframe, that it's going into the market and the current state of AI... we felt like that FP6 is a format that has potential to not only be used for inferencing, but potentially for training. And so we wanted to make sure that the capabilities for FP6 were class-leading relative to... what others maybe would have been implementing, or have implemented. And so, as you know, it's a long lead time to design hardware, so we were thinking about this years ago and wanted to make sure that MI350 had leadership in FP6 performance. So we made a decision to implement the FP6 data path at the same throughput as the FP4 data path. Of course, we had to take on a little bit more hardware in order to do that. FP6 has a few more bits, obviously, that's why it's called FP6. But we were able to do that within the area of constraints that we had in the matrix engine, and do that in a very power- and area-efficient way.\n \nreply",

These studies address the ethical and environmental consequences of war shown through the dystopian nature of the film\u2019s setting and its religious symbolism.

      "This is quite cool! Very excited for this concept. Kudos to launching on HN!some genuine feedback on a frustrating early experience:- I ran the suggested \"Group all my tabs by topic\" in productivity agent mode. It worked great.- I then asked it to remove all tab groups and reset things, but was told this:    This is a browser automation task. Please use **Agent Mode** for web interactions like clicking, filling forms, navigating sites, or extracting web content.\n\n- Tried \"agent mode\" and was told:    This is a productivity task. Please use **Chat Mode** for tab management, bookmarks, sessions, history, and content analysis.\n\n- Basically was being sent back and forth. Went back to productivity mode and argued with it for a bit. The closest I could come to it removing all tabs groups was creating a new tab group encompassing all tabs, but couldn't get it to remove groups entirely. I'm guessing it might lack that API?Overall, it'd be nice if every browser level action it took had an undo button. Or at least if it was smart enough/able to remove the tab groups it just created.Will keep playing with it more.edit1: one more weird issue: While running the chat interface on chrome internal pages like chrome://extensions, it would randomly browse me to google.com for some reason.edit2: confirmed that productivity mode lacks a tool to ungroup tabs, just a tool to create tab groups.\n \nreply",
      "IMO comments so far seem to be not seeing the forest for the trees -- I can imagine incredible value for myself in a browser that hooks into a local LLM, writes everything it sees to a local timestamped database (oversimplification), parses and summarizes everything you interact with (again, oversimplification -- this would be tunable and scriptable), exposes Puppeteer-like functionality that is both scriptable via code and prompt-to-generate-code, helps you map shit out, remember stuff, find forgotten things that are \"on the tip of your [digital] tongue\", learn what you're interested in (again, local), help proactively filter ads, spam, phishing, bullshit you don't want to see, etc, can be wound up and let go to tackle internet tasks autonomously for (and WITH) you (oversimplification), on and on and on.Bookmarks don't cut it anymore when you've got 25 years of them saved.Falling down deep rabbit holes because you landed on an attention-desperate website to check one single thing and immediately got distracted can be reduced by running a bodyguard bot to filter junk out. Those sites create deafening noise that you can squash by telling the bot to just let you know when somebody replies to your comment with something of substance that you might actually want to read.If it truly works, I can imagine the digital equivalent of a personal assistant + tour manager + doorman + bodyguard + housekeeper + mechanic + etc, that could all be turned off and on with a switch.Given that the browser is our main portal to the chaos that is internet in 2025, this is not a bad idea! Really depends on the execution, but yeah.. I'm very curious to see how this project (and projects like it) go.\n \nreply",
      "Thank you so much for your honest feedback. I 100% agree - this is spot on! This is exactly the vision we had.We spend 90%+ of our time in browsers, yet they're still basically dumb windows. Having an AI assistant that remembers what you visited, clips important articles (remember Evernote web clipper?), saves highlights and makes everything semantically searchable - all running locally - would be game-changing.Everything stays in a local PostgresDB - your history, highlights, sessions. You can ask \"what was that pricing comparison from last month?\" or \"find my highlights about browser automation\" and it just works. Plus built-in self-control features to block distracting sites when you need to focus.Beyond search and memory, the browser can actually help you work. AI that intelligently groups your tabs (\"these 15 are all Chromium research\"), automation for grunt work (\"compare 2TB hard drive prices across these sites\"), or even \"summarize all new posts in my Discord servers\" - all handled locally. The browser should help us manage internet chaos, not add to it.Would love to hear what specific workflows are painful for you!\n \nreply",
      "Okay, maybe this is a stupid question, but: what is an agentic browser? You seem to assume that everyone knows what that means.Is this a common and well-defined term that people use? I've never heard it.It would appear to me from the context that it means something like \"web browser with AI stuff tackled on\".\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for asking - not a stupid question at all! I should have probably explained it at the top of my post.By \"agentic browser\" we basically mean a browser with AI agents that can do web navigation tasks for you.

    "first_paragraph": "he/himProof engineer, logician 17 minute read Published: May 21, 2025If you\u2019ve taken an algorithms class, you have likely seen dynamic programming, specifically a technique called memoization. Memoization works to optimize recursive algorithms by caching the solutions to subproblems in a table, and when a subproblem is encountered, it queries the table instead of recomputing the solution. This gives us an exponential performance boost.This blog post will show how to solve a dynamic programming problem using memoization in Lean, and verify its correctness against a specification.

      "Agreed -- \"is a term of the sum\" is such an inverted way to look at it.Better I think would be to say \"the result in column i and row j is the sum of product of elements in column i of the left cracovian and column j of the right cracovian\".And even by this definition the example given doesn't seem to track (and the strangeness of sometimes saying \"+\" and sometimes not, and having both \"0\" and \"-0\" in the example is bananas!):   {  3  2 } {  1  -4 }  =   {  5   -2 }\n   { -1  0 } { -2   3 }  =   {  0    2 }\n\n\n   3 * 1 + -1 * -2 == 5 -- check\n   3 * -4 + -1 * 3 == -15 -- what?\n   2 * 1 + 0 * -2 == 2 (okay, but shouldn't this be in the lower left, column 1 dotted with column 2?)\n   2 * -4 + 0 * 3 = -8 (now I'm really missing something)\n \nreply",

    "first_paragraph": "Linear algebra is typically explained using matrices. But matrix theory is just one possible perspective. Below, I describe an alternative approach to linear algebra.Tadeusz Banachiewicz (1882\u20131954), a Polish astronomer living in Krakow, was passionate about calculating machines. From the 1920s, Banachiewicz developed a method for computations on tables of numbers, which was particularly easy to perform with arithmometers. In honor of Krakow, Banachiewicz named these computational objects cracovians. In the preface to Banachiewicz\u2019s book, Cracovian Algebra (Rachunek krakowianowy, PWN 1959), it is noted that \u201csome calculations, generally known to be very tedious, became a sheer entertainment for the executor.\u201dSimilar to matrices, cracovians are represented as rectangular tables of numbers. The equality of cracovians, addition of cracovians, and multiplication of cracovians by a scalar are defined identically to their matrix counterparts.

      "I've read the abstract and disagreed with it enough that I don't want to read the article proper.1) The abstract appears to be an opinion piece; I don't know how they do things in philosophical journals but I would hope for a dryer standard.2) Nature is really messy - it'd make sense if parts of our bodys were actually parasites. The immune system, gut flora, skin mites are all obvious places where foreign hostile bodies might colonise then integrate into humanity over time. If an addition has any benefits evolutionary pressure will eventually cause it to become symbiotic.3) Humans are by design easy to manipulate. We're social animals built to group up behind leaders and do what they say. There are brutal social hierarchies where low status humans live relatively unpleasant lives because high-status humans think that is reasonable. We're not built to unthinkingly optimise out own personal outcomes of make all the decisions ourselves. Humans being manipulated is not, in and of itself, a hint that things are going wrong.4) \"It is not plausible for a part of the cognitive system to be designed to thwart the goals and desires of the user in the way a smartphone is\" - it absolutely is, the #1 enemy of most people is their own mind.

      "> Suppose I've got a motor, a motor driver, and an Arduino. How does ROS work with that?It does not, ROS is for much bigger systems, usually Linux-based. Some things it can give you:- IPC for multiple independent processes. So if your navigation process crashes, your drivers and controller still operate. Can save some time if your stack is slow to start up.- Visualizer - not the best out there, but kinda-working. And because of previous item, you can keep it off (to save CPU) and only start if needed.- Device drivers for some devices. Those would be \"research grade\" - any problems would be ignored and may result in invalid data, or they can crash, or be very inefficient... But good enough to get started.- Logging/replay - log data to file, replay later. Again, research grade - there is no schema evolution (at least in ROS 1), so the moment you add new field, throw away your old logs. You can also use it to make whole-system tests, but because there is no explicit sync, those tests would be janky and flaky.- some pre-made modules, like localizationit's a lot of small pieces, good enough to start or for prototype, but not for the more \"production\" robots.As far as alternatives...

Most recently, I've just asked ChatGPT for such code (having done it myself the harder ways in years past, so admittedly I know reasonably well what to ask...).Once you achieve code that moves the motor at various speeds or directions, you might e.g. connect to the Arduino from a computer (e.g. raspberry pi), write a python \"ROS Node\" script that listens to a ROS topic and sends serial commands from the Pi to the Arduino.Then, if you attach a laser range-finder or 2D lidar to the Pi, and look for a corresponding ROS node for that laser hardware (on github via google), you would run that additional ROS Node...And finally you might write the \"main\" script as a third ROS Node that:- Interprets the laser data it gets from the laser node's published ROS topic\n- Has some logic for the robot that interprets that data and chooses to set speed/direction of the motor.This is all very ad hoc description but hopefully somewhat helpful...
