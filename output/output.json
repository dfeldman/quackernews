This is even more important if we consider low latency gaming situations.Mobile applications are also relevant. An LLM in your car could be used for local intelligence. I'm pretty sure self driving cars use some about of local AI already (although obviously not LLM, and I don't really know how much of their processing is local vs done on a server somewhere).If models stop advancing at a fast clip, hardware will eventually become fast and cheap enough that running models locally isn't something we think about as being a non-sensical luxury, in the same way that we don't think that rendering graphics locally is a luxury even though remote rendering is possible.reply",

      "I love my e-ink tablet.Regardless of manufacturer (remarkable, boox, supernote\u2026), all e-paper tablets have one major performance problem: quickly scrolling through multiple pages of notes. No idea if the display is the limiting factor, or the cpu, but I\u2019ve hit this issue on all tablets I\u2019ve used. If you like riffling through pages in you paper notebook, you will hit the limit too. I know at least 2 people who stopped using their tablets over time because of this issue.If this tech helps solve that problem, it\u2019s more important to me than an eink monitor.Edit: this is mainly important for notes, because sketches, scribbled diagrams and quick notes half-taken in meetings are not really searchable. PDFs and ebooks don\u2019t have this problem.reply",
      "Eink always could be driven quickly. The issue is that LCDs are more powerful efficient at high refresh ratesEInk needs a lot of power to move the heavier ink particles around. If you are doing that more and more rapidly, then even more power is drawn.By 75Hz, I'm almost certain that LCD is far more power efficient. The LCD pixel (aka the liquid crystal) is a glorified capacitor, it takes some power to charge but it's exceptionally 'light' compared to eink.That's why LCDs can go faster and faster. It's just physics. A capacitor / twisted crystal uses less power to turn on or off than EInk.---------EInks advantage is that if you turn off power, the ink stays put. So you spend a ton of power moving the ink around and then save lots and lots of power over the next seconds, minutes or more.That's why EInk is ideal for once-a-day updates of prices (or other retailer tasks). The less you update, the less power used.reply",

      "Thanks. That article seems to have the quote I was looking for.> E-ink screens are quite power hungry when it comes to peak current. Modern high-resolution panels can consume >20 W peak.This is where I was wondering and yeah, 20+W is pretty hefty to support a relatively small 8\" EInk screen or something.All those updates cost all that power as long as updates are occurring. Maybe you can optimize many of them away (if some parts of the screen don't move, especially if software was rewritten to optimize for the display).More importantly, it sounds like you've created a full custom FPGA controller over the voltages that go into an EInk display? That's impressive in its own right even if I don't think 75Hz is a good idea lol.--------FPGA or Full Blown Microprocessor are the only choices here. A high power SIMD/NEON arm64 probably could do the job, but I think the Spartan6 is a good choice as well and has more obvious and straightforward parallelism (and probably all the pins required to control the screen. Even a big microprocessor won't have as many low latency pins as an FPGA).reply",

      "E-Ink's other advantage is being a non-emissive display.  Transflective LCD displays have low contrast.  I'm literally holding an e-ink tablet over the transflective monitor I'm typing this on and the difference in contrast at the same ambient illumination is considerable.  If the price were right, I'd definitely consider a 75 Hz e-ink monitor even if the power draw was more than a normal LCD monitor.reply",

      "Out of curiosity, if you have 75Hz but you're refreshing sparingly (e.g. you're in VSCode writing, unless you're scrolling, most pixels remain unchanged), wouldn't e-ink remain power-efficient?reply",
      "Probably.  E-ink drivers (\"waveforms\" is, I believe, the term of art) frequently target refreshes only at the portion of the display that has updated, using rectangles or other more-specific geometries to limit that area.For text updates, where there's literally a cursor which moves at typing speeds, update frequency is quite low.  Where you're updating or paging through documents, paginated navigation (where the whole screen refreshes at once, then remains unchanged for several seconds to minutes or longer) is quite efficient.reply"

Though memory corruption bugs are usually interchangeable, MIE cut off so many exploit steps at a fundamental level that it was not possible to restore the chains by swapping in new bugs. Even with substantial effort, we could not rebuild any of these chains to work around MIE. The few memory corruption effects that remained are unreliable and don\u2019t give attackers sufficient momentum to successfully exploit these bugs.This is great, and a bit of a buried lede.

The advantage of MTE/MIE is you can do it incrementally by just changing the high bits the allocator supplies; CHERI requires a fundamental paradigm shift.

There is more and cheaper education available than ever before.  Nearly every highschooler has more access to learning that kings and emperors would have fought wars for less than 200 years ago.  However,the United States, particularly in the last 50 years, seems to have fostered a culture averse to education.  I believe the years long decline in test scores is a symptom of that cultural shift.reply",

      "Particularly, the biggest incentives are test scores and passing rates, which incentivize attention only to the bottom 50% and 20% of students (respectively). This means:- You do not diversify classrooms by academic ability---the high-performing students can be free tutors to the low-performing students.- You inflate the GPAs and implement no-zero policies.- You teach to the standardized tests, and don't worry about the material.- You make lessons \"fun and engaging\" because you need the attention of the students least likely to give you their attention.- You eliminate gifted or honors programs, because that's wasted money not improving your bottom line (bottom students).reply",

That changed in 2003 (same year as the NBA license) when they released the Cloud City set, and evidently came to the realization that they could not continue to use yellow for all characters. That set includes yellow Han and Leia minifigs, by the way - white skin tone minifigs came later.The point is that if the claim which, yes, Lego has made since 1978, that yellow was neutral and could represent any race \u201a\u00c4\u00ec if that claim has any value, they could have proudly released 10123 Cloud City with a yellow Lando.They didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t.

I can think of a few use cases for this, especially anything where you want to use containers as the delivery mechanism[0]: https://github.com/losfair/bakereply",

      "I don't know about the [1] but I think that [2] actually embed's crun https://github.com/containers/crun in the executable itself.Crun can be/is used by podman/docker too so you could think that its essentially stripping docker down to its core of running oci containers and just taking the most lightweight and (fastest?) approach and embedding it directly into the executable.I am sure that I might get somethings wrong, I usually do, so if I have an error, please do let me know as I don't wish to spread misinformationThis project on the other hand seems to be using bake https://github.com/losfair/bake which seems to take something like a docker container and I think essentially push it into something like .iso using squashfs\nThe idea here is that they seem to embed firecracker itself into a single binary to actually just make it an executable that can run that microvm as it is.And I think that bottlefire just seems to do something similar but they do it on their server side and seem to just provide you a binary to make things easy for you...I am not sure with microvm's architecture but it seems that there are some additional features that you can get since they are VM, maybe you can get the ability of https://criu.org/Main_Page out of the box but this doesn't seem to be done right now but In my opinion is really very doable.Another idea might be more security. I am going to refer to an article [1] which talks about flatpak but it has this line and I quote `containers are not sandboxed`, so I suppose that this can help blur the lines b/w containers by converting containers into microvm's and then leveraging vm's technology for sandboxing or some other mechanism rather easily as compared to docker (I see it use landlock which was new to me!)article [1]: https://hanako.codeberg.page/reply",

      "This is critical infrastructure, and it gets compromised way too often. There are so many horror stories of NPM (and similar) packages getting filled with malware. You can't rely on people not falling for phishing 100% of the time.People who publish software packages tend to be at least somewhat technical people. Can package publishing platforms PLEASE start SIGNING emails. Publish GPG keys (or whatever, I don't care about the technical implementation) and sign every god damned email you send to people who publish stuff on your platform.Educate the publishers on this. Get them to distrust any unsigned email, no matter how convincing it looks.And while we're at it, it's clear that the current 2FA approach isn't good enough. I don't know how to improve on it, but it's clear that the actions in this example were suspicious: user logs in, changes 2FA settings, immediately adds a new API token, which immediately gets used to publish packages. Maybe there should be a 24 hour period where nothing can be published after changing any form of credentials. Accompanied by a bunch of signed notification emails. Of course that's all moot if the attacker also changes the email address.reply",
      "Disclosure: I\u2019m the founder of https://socket.devWe analyzed this DuckDB incident today. The attacker phished a maintainer on npmjs.help, proxied the real npm, reset 2FA, then immediately created a new API token and published four malicious versions. A short publish freeze after 2FA or token changes would have broken that chain. Signed emails help, but passkeys plus a publish freeze on auth changes is what would have stopped this specific attack.There was a similar npm phishing attack back in July (https://socket.dev/blog/npm-phishing-email-targets-developer...). In that case, signed emails would not have helped. The phish used npmjs.org \u2014 a domain npm actually owns \u2014 but they never set DMARC there. DMARC is only set on npmjs.com, the domain they send email from. This is an example of the \u201clack of an affirmative indicator\u201d problem. Humans are bad at noticing something missing. Browsers learned this years ago: instead of showing a lock icon to indicate safety, they flipped it to show warnings only when unsafe. Signed emails have the same issue \u2014 users often won\u2019t notice the absence of the right signal. Passkeys and publish freezes solve this by removing the human from the decision point.reply",

It's at protonapps.com. Just... why? Why would you train your users to download apps from domains other than your primary one?It also annoys me when people see this happening and point out how the person who fell for the attack missed some obvious detail they would have noticed.

      "At $org, we too are undertaking a mandatory RTO order, enforced with door access logs.People are up in arms, particularly those in our smaller locales, where the offices we have are perfunctory at best.The rationale is the usual one: collaboration, watercooler chat, unspecific evidence / \"research\" about productivity (that we are told definitely exists, but is yet to be shared).I remain baffled by executives' obsession with RTO... C suites are committed to spending as much as possible on real estate and geographically limiting their talent pool. Whilst making workers more tired and less productive.I still have no idea where it comes from. My best guess is that nobody at that level wants to break ranks with the \"collective wisdom\" of \"investors\", which creates a kind of groupthink.(An RTO mandate is also an excellent thing for a CEO to show investors they are doing, if they are not making money and lack better ideas.)reply",
      "> I remain baffled by executives' obsession with RTOIt's because although many people do work well in RTO, the vast majority don't. And the various TikTok videos showing \"Day in the life of a remote worker\" didn't help the cause either. I worked at a fully remote company during the pandemic and trying to get people online was almost impossible. They would disappear for hours and I would be blocked by them and it was one of the most frustrating experiences in my career.I love working in the office, mainly for the social aspect and free food, but I need to find remote work for personal reasons.  And I'm about 2 years too late because almost no one in Big Tech is allowing remote work anymore.reply",
      ">> where it comes fromIt's a power play. To show regular folks their place. Big corpo is a modern feodal state, where CEO is an emperor, c-suites are kings, managers are barons, IC are peasants and external contractors are slaves(but leased from other owner).It's not only RTO, it's also about timetable and dress code. Yes, I had a beef with IT manager about dress code in the development office of a bank. Just because he can show his power he tried to enforce dress code.reply",
      "A big difference between feudalism and modern societies is that in feudalism, you expect to earn much less than the value of the land you inherit and pass on (or the custom or right of your family farming the land) whereas in modern societies most people will earn much more in lifetime earnings than they would inherit or pass on. This results in far more social mobility and much more freedom in praxis. I don\u2019t think companies are like feudal societies.reply",

      "Lol you missed the weather... Bay area weather is much more moderate than in the Midwest.reply",
      "For highly-specialized engineers and researchers, there\u2019s often only a tiny handful of companies they could work for that offer jobs in their specialties.  For example, if you\u2019re a compilers expert, there are only so many companies that hire compiler developers, whether it\u2019s working on a commercial compiler like Microsoft Visual Studio or contributing to an open-source project such as LLVM (Apple is a major contributor).  These jobs tend to be concentrated in a few global metro areas.Additionally, Silicon Valley in particular benefits from having multiple companies in overlapping specialties.  Suppose I\u2019m a GPU expert working for NVIDIA, and suddenly I hit a setback and it\u2019s time for a new job.  Well, Apple is just a few miles away, and Apple makes GPUs and NPUs, and so I\u2019d have a shot at working for Apple.Contrast that with people living in areas with little diversity among tech companies.  For example, Intel recently laid off a ton of engineers working near Portland, Oregon.  There are few alternative technical employers in the region, especially in the specialties Intel focused on in Portland.  Those laid-off engineers are facing the prospects of pivoting to a different tech specialty with more employment opportunities, competing for remote jobs at a time when so many companies are requiring their employees to return to the office, or relocating from Portland, which is massively disruptive and can potentially be very expensive.  Some may be forced to retire early.Silicon Valley may be insanely expensive and ultra-competitive, but it also has critical mass, which is vital for highly-specialized engineers and researchers.reply",

      "I don't work in cybersecurity and, after looking at the site's homepage, couldn't exactly figure out from all the buzzwords what exactly is this product. The most concerning takeaway from this article for me is that the maintainers of Huntress (whatever it is) can keep a log of, as well as personally access, the users' browser history, history of launched executables, device's hostname, and presumably a lot of other information. How is this product not a total security nightmare?reply",
      "It's definitely not a product for an individual user. Controls like this are useful in certain arenas where you need total visibility of corporate devices. As with any highly privileged tool or service, compromise of it can be a big problem. That said, the goal with tools like this is to usually lock down and keep a close eye on company issued laptops and the like so you know when one gets stolen, hit by some malware, or somebody does things with it they aren't allowed to be doing (e.g. exfiltrating corp data, watching porn at work, running unauthorized executable, connecting to problematic networks, etc.).As an example, if you're at a FedRAMP High certified service provider, the DoD wants to know that the devices your engineers are using to maintain the service they pay for aren't running a rootkit and that you can prove that said employee using that device isn't mishandling sensitive information.reply",
      "This makes sense, but in this case, isn't the company behind Huntress having direct access to this data still a problem? For example, if the government purchased Outlook licenses, I'd assume DoD can read clerks' emails, but Microsoft employees can't. I imagine worst case compromising a lot of Huntress' users is just a question of compromising of its developers, like one of the people in the authors section of this article.reply",
      "Many businesses outsource their SOC to third parties like Huntress, Carbon Black, SentinelOne, all of whom offer very fancy Endpoint Detection and Respone (EDR) tools. Just about every EDR solution is a Cloud/SaaS offering provided either directly or indirectly through a third party Managed Service Provider (MSP). We call this Managed Detection and Respone (MDR). From technical and privacy standpoints, it probably sounds like a huge risk, but it's also worth acknowledging that EDR companies operate immense threat intelligence platforms through real-time monitoring of customers. From a C-suite perspective, it makes a lot of sense to offload the specializations of real-time protection and malware analysis to EDR solutions. There are risk managers who have quantified the risk tolerance for these types of products/arrangements. The company legal department, the CFO, and the board of directors are all satisfied with the EDR solutions placement on the Gartner quadrant and SOC Type 3 report saying the EDR provider follows best practices. Sometimes it's even a requirement for \"cyber insurance\" which a business may need depending on the industry. For better or for worse, EDR is how most institutions secure their IT infrastructure today.reply",
      "For worse, I would say. This kind of thing is about accountability shuffling and not at all about improving security.reply",
      "I'm concerned that you're not familiar with EDR and organizations who flat out can't build a full 24/7 SOC. Which is the vast majority of businesses.EDR is a rootkit based on the idea that malware hashes are useless, and security needs to get complete insight into systems after a compromise. You can't root out an attacker with persistence without software that's as invasive as the malware can get.And a managed SOC is shifting accountability to an extent because they are often _far_ cheaper than the staff it takes to have a 24/7 SOC. That's assuming you have the talent to build a SOC instead of paying for a failed SOC build. Also, don't forget that you need backup staff for sick leave and vacation. And you'll have to be constantly hiring due to SOC burnout.If all of this sounds like expensive band-aids instead of dealing with the underlying infection, it is. It's complex solutions to deal with complex attackers going after incredibly complex systems. But I haven't really heard of security solutions that reduce complexity and solve the deep underlying problems.Not even theoretical solutions.Other than \"unplug it all\".reply",
      "Huh? Small and medium sized businesses have how much to spend on security? Let alone IT?reply",
      "Oh, absolutely. There are some ways to avoid this--customer managed encyrption keys, for example--but there will always be some kind of trade-off. The less an EDR (endpoint detection & response) tool can see, the less useful it is. Going with a customer managed encryption approach means the customer is then on the hook for watching and alerting on suspicious activity. Some orgs have the capacity and expertise to do this. Many do not. It often comes down to deciding if you have a budget to do this yourself to a level you and an auditor/customer is comfortable with (and proving it) or outsourcing to a known and trusted expert.EDIT: For additional context, I'd add that security/risk tradeoffs happen all the time. In practice trusting Huntress isn't too different than trusting NPM with an engineer that has root access to their machine or any kind of centralized IT provisioning/patching setup.reply",
      "You would think so, but in general the kind of attitude to security that results in these kinds of products actively encourages increasing the number of entities that have very highly privileged access to your system. 'Supply chain attacks' and 'attack surface' don't really register in this area, but 'buy this and you will be more secure' sales pitches very much do, especially with a dose of FOMO from 'industry standard' rhetoric.reply",
