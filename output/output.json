      "Yeah, Software protection was very naive in the beginning. Fun fact: I owned a windows 3.11 for workgroup UPGRADE disc collection, it was clearly explained and also enforced from the setup installer. So, no previous installed win 3.0 == upgrade installer will fail. The fix: just create an empty Textfile named win.com at any place - the installer simple scans the WHOLE disk just for this existing filename. Next fun fact: in reality, the Upgrade contained the full installation, no only a delta. Men, software was so simple these days....reply",
      "I have a childhood memory of my dad buying a shrink-wrapped copy of the Windows 3.1 Upgrade that was supposed to allow any installation of \"3.0 or earlier\" to become Win 3.1. it turned out when we actually tried it it only accepted 3.x though. [1]I think he ended up pirating a 3.x install from a friend and running the upgrade on to of that; felt pretty morally clear given what the box had advertised.[1]: eg https://www.ebay.com/itm/376080245422reply",
      "Many a crack back in the day was even more simple still, we'd just find and alter the right JE or JNE into a JMP and we're off to the races.   As the author found, the tough part is just finding and interpreting where and how the protection was implemented.   If throwing the exe in a hex editor gave you access to String Data References (not always the case, but more common than not) then you'd just fail the check you were trying to skip, find that string, hop over into assembly to see what triggered loading that, and then just alter the logic to jump over it when the time comes.reply",
      "There's a lot of things going on that lead to this.One, the developers spend more time running this code than we do, and they have to get the program working before we can even use it. So any parts of the program that are hostile to the developers risks killing the entire project. Obfuscating the copy protection can hit a point where it makes bug fixing difficult.Two, lack of training. If you, me, and Steve each have a bag of tricks we all use to crack games, whichever one of us figures it out gets bragging rights but the game remains cracked. Meanwhile Developer Dan has to be aware of all the tricks in all of our bags together if he wants to keep the three of us out. Only there's not three of us, there's 300. Or today, probably more like 30,000.Three, lack of motivation, which is itself several different situations. There's a certain amount of passive aggression you can put into a feature you don't even really want to work on. You can lean into any of the other explanations to defend why your code didn't protect from cracking all that much, but it's a checkbox that's trying to prove a negative, and nobody is going to give you any credit for getting it to work right in the same way they give you credit for fixing that corner glitch that the QA people keep bitching about. Or getting that particle animation to work that makes the AOE spells look badass.reply",
      "I remember I had some demo software that could be enabled with a code.  I was just curious and at the code prompt, I entered the debugger.  I dumped the process space and there was a nul-terminated string of letters and numbers.  I restarted the process and entered them at the prompt and voila, it was enabled.(I did go on to pay for the software)reply",
      "> Many a crack back in the day was even more simple still, we'd just find and alter the right JE or JNE into a JMP and we're off to the races.I did that with dBASE III, which used ProLok \"laser protection\" from Vault Corporation - a signature burned onto the diskette with a laser. Back then, I found it amazing that Ashton-Tate actually spent money to contract with a copy protection company for something that could be so easily defeated by a teenager reading assembler.They could have easily just written the same kind of code themselves. An example of the power of marketing over substance.I was able to replicate that protection mechanism just by scratching a diskette with a pin. The \"laser\" was a meaninglessly advanced-sounding solution that added no value compared to any other means of damaging a diskette.reply",
      "> I was able to replicate that protection mechanism just by scratching a diskette with a pin.How did you figure out where to scratch it? Was the laser mark visible on the original disk, or did you have to read the code and orient based on the diskette's index hole?reply",
      "Yes, it was apparently very visible: https://martypc.blogspot.com/2024/09/pc-floppy-copy-protecti...But as I mentioned in a sibling comment, I\u2019m not sure it was ever confirmed that it was really a laser that made that mark.reply",
      "I described two different scenarios: defeating the protection, and replicating it, e.g. to protect your own software without paying Vault for their \"laser\" protection.Defeating the protection didn't involve knowing anything about the laser mark - as the comment I replied to described, it just involved changing a conditional jump to an unconditional one.Replicating the protection involved causing minor damage on the diskette - the details don't really matter, laser, pin scratch, whatever - then formatting the disk, and registering the pattern of bad sectors created by the damage. A normal copy of the disk didn't replicate those bad sectors exactly, which made it possible to detect that the original disk was not present.reply",
      "I remember doing something similar with Lemmings 3D. You could simply NOP over  the JMP into the copy-protection subroutine. It was surprisingly easy.Made me feel like such a badass hacker at 15 years old.reply"

Apparently, RPG was subsequently ported to MS-DOS, so that the same software tools built with RPG could run on personal computers, which is how we ended up here.This accounting firm was actually using a Windows 98 computer (yep, in 2026), and running the RPG software inside a DOS console window. And it turned out that,"

      "I'm genuinely surprised that there isn't column-level shared-dictionary string compression built into SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB or Postgres, like this post is describing.SQLite has no compression support, MySQL/MariaDB have page-level compression which doesn't work great and I've never seen anyone enable in production, and Postgres has per-value compression which is good for extremely long strings, but useless for short ones.There are just so many string columns where values and substrings get repeated so much, whether you're storing names, URL's, or just regular text. And I have databases I know would be reduced in size by at least half.Is it just really really hard to maintain a shared dictionary when constantly adding and deleting values? Is there just no established reference algorithm for it?It still seems like it would be worth it even if it were something you had to manually set. E.g. wait until your table has 100,000 values, build a dictionary from those, and the dictionary is set in stone and used for the next 10,000,000 rows too unless you rebuild it in the future (which would be an expensive operation).reply",
      "Strings in textual index are already compressed, with common prefix compression or other schemes. They are perfectly queryable. Not sure if their compression scheme is for index or data columns.Global column dictionary has more complexity than normal. Now you are touching more pages than just the index pages and data page. The dictionary entries are sorted, so you need to worry about page expansion and contraction. They side step the problems by making it immutable, presumably building it up front by scanning all the data.Not sure why using FSST is better than using a standard compression algorithm to compress the dictionary entries.Storing the strings themselves as dictionary IDs is a good idea, as they can be processed quickly with SIMD.reply",

In other words, suppose that the collection of sets that don't contain themselves is a set and call it X.Here's another assumption: Suppose X contains itself. Then by the premise, X doesn't contain itself, which is contradictory. Since the innermost assumption is that X contains itself, this proves that X doesn't contain itself (under the other assumption).But if X doesn't contain itself, then by the premise again, X is in X, which is again contradictory. Now the only remaining assumption is that X exists, and so this proves that there cannot be a set with the stated property.

      "This is an outstanding blog post.  Initially, the title did little to captivate me, but the blog post was so well written that I got nerd-sniped.  Who knew this little adapter was so fascinating!  I wonder if the manufacturer is buying the Mellanox cards used from data center tear-downs.  The author claims they can be had for only 20 USD online.  That seems too good to be true!Small thing: I just checked Amazon.com: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thunderbolt+25G&crid=2RHL4ZJL96Z9...I cannot find anything for less than 285 USD.  The blog post gave a price of 174 USD.  I have no reason to disbelieve the author, but a bummer to see the current price is 110 USD more!reply",
      "Thank you!I think, tragically, the blog post has caused this price increase.The offers on Amazon are most likely all drop shippers trying to gauge a price that works for them.You might have better luck ordering directly from China for a fraction of the price: https://detail.1688.com/offer/836680468489.htmlreply",
      "> The author claims they can be had for only 20 USD online. That seems too good to be true!In my experience, the cheap eBay MLX cards are DellEMC/HPE/etc OEM cards. However I also encountered zero problems cross-flashing those cards back to generic Mellanox firmware. I'm running several of those cross-flashed CX-4 Lx cards going on six or seven years now and they've been totally bulletproof.reply",
      "I saw the blog post last week and immediately bought the last one on that Amazon listing for the original price... hopefully they restock soon!I'm going to try a couple other fan assisted cooling options, as I'd like to keep the setup reasonably compact.I just ran fiber to my desk and I have a more expensive QNAP unit that does 10G SFP+, but this will let me max out the connection to my NAS.reply",

      "I believe the author is talking about the OCP (2.0) network card itself, that these adapters internally. The OCP nics are quite cheap compared to pcie - here\u2019s 100GBE for 100!\nhttps://ebay.us/m/HMQAphreply",
      "This 100GbE card is an OCP 2.0 type 2 adapter, which will _probably_ not work with the PX PCB since that NIC has two of these mezzanine connectors, and PX only one.What also may not work are Dell rNDC cards. They look like they have OCP 2.0 type 1 connectors, but may not quite fit (please correct me if I'm wrong). They do however have a nice cooling solution, which could be retrofitted to one of the OCP 2.0 cards.I've also ordered a Chelsio T6225-OCP cards out of curiosity. These should fit in the PX adapter but require a 3rd-party driver on macOS (which then supports jumbo frames, etc.)What also fits physically is a Broadcom BCM957304M3040C, but there are no drivers on macOS, and I couldn't get the firmware updated on Linux either.reply",
      "That\u2019s a good point to note! I think the stacking height would matter, but in theory the single connector is still 8x pcie and should link without the upper 8x lanes connected.Spec for reference, I\u2019m not 100% sure. \nhttps://docs.nvidia.com/nvidia-connectx-5-ethernet-adapter-c...reply",

    "first_paragraph": "I stumbled upon this tiny Thunderbolt to 25 Gigabit Ethernet adapter on Amazon. It\u2019s powered from the host, meaning there is only one cable, no additional power supply required. This is great for mobile setups and desktop work alike.The device comes in a nice travel pouch along with a rather short Thunderbolt cable. It is plug-and-play on macOS.You can find the device under many names on Amazon (search for \u201cthunderbolt 25G\u201d). It comes in two flavors, single port and dual port SFP28, currently starting from $157. Most of its Amazon product pages don\u2019t have reviews, and if they do, they\u2019re mostly negative. I initially bought the dual port version at a good price, and later also obtained the single port version used in an even better deal.There\u2019s no manual or manufacturer information; I assume it was put together by a small company in China (I found a corresponding offering on a Chinese b2b platform). On my MacBook Pro, the device identifies as \u201cPX Thunderbolt to Ethernet\u201d.All other 25 Gb"

      "I recommend it the NetBird team is transparent and easy to reach. I switched from Tailscale a while ago (2y), went fully self-hosted, and upgrades across versions have been smooth, which tells me they care about the self-hosted, not just their cloud offering.reply",
      "We tried netbird but could not get the client to register to a self hosted server. It ignored the setting or failed.Good chance it was user error on our part.Most of their documentation is very unclear about what is a cloud offering feature and what is possible using self-hosting. There are features not available on the community edition and you have to be very careful reading their doc.Just putting it out there so people do not think it's an easy solution. It will require appropriate planning.I do think its a more promising solution than headscale if you want to self host as it is a complete package, unlike tailscale where you need to modify registry keys to change the cloud URL and headscale is a simplified, non-multi-tenant signaler.reply",
      "There is a dedicated page explaining the difference between selfhosted and cloud versions: https://docs.netbird.io/selfhosted/self-hosted-vs-cloud-netb...You can also use profiles and set management URL in the settings through the UI. You can even switch between self hosted and cloud versions: https://docs.netbird.io/client/profilesreply",
      "We also had a bunch of problems. The DNS resolution didn't work, and support was unable to figure out the reason.A coworker reported domain access breaking when he went to office 1, but fixed itself when he went to office 2.For a while, when you logged in with the wrong account, it was near impossible to replace it. This on is fixed now, but the entire thing still feels very much like paying for beta software.reply",
      "I have endless DNS problems with Tailscale. So I am guessing it\u2019s a hard problem.reply",
      "I've been working for a while on https://github.com/connet-dev/connet. It gives a different twist at the same problem - instead of an overlay network at L4 (wireguard, etc) or publicly accessible endpoint at L7 (like ngrok) it \"projects\" a remote endpoint locally (e.g. as if you are running the service on your computer). Of course \"locally\" can always be a VPS that has caddy in front to give you ngrok-like experience.The reason connet exists is that nothing (at the time I started, including netbird, tailscale/headscale, frp, rathole, etc) gave the same easy to understand, FOSS, self-hosted, direct peer-to-peer way of remote access to your resources. I believe it does accomplish this and it is self-hosted. And while a cloud deployment at https://connet.dev exists, it is nothing more then repackaging the FOSS project with user/token management.reply",
      "This is meant just for computers, right? A quick check of the readme showed that devices must run this or that commands, which seems difficult to do on an smartphone. I guess the ngrok-like setup would be the way to go for that case, given the increasing prevalence of phones and tablets as the single form of computing for lots of peoplereply",
      "I've been thinking a lot about this case specifically. And you are right, phones are largely not supported right now - I've been researching how to make that happen. One case I've found that works for me currently is running connet via Termux - and I've made the necessary changes to support that.Native iOS/Android clients, if possible, will probably be the next things I'll work on. At minimum they should enable you to run a \"source\" (e.g. a consumer of an exposed service), but ideally it will be the whole deal.reply",
      "A neat idea, but projecting all of these services onto localhost is a bit of a security nightmare. Have you considered looking at what something like Twingate does? Using the CGNAT IP space for the projection allows you to give every individual service its own IP address, which helps quite a bit in terms of allowing you to isolate the services from e.g. malicious web pages.reply",
