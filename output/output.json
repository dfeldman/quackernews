      "This is a breath of fresh air. Modern pick up trucks post-2017 are giant vehicles with high danger to pedestrians. They are often touted as off road capable with high utility, and I see them in pristine condition on city streets hauling a totality of one human.Good overviews of the truck https://youtu.be/aEq-vTLimrQ?si=fS-UhjndoWuxwBiphttps://youtu.be/1OgN_qctcGs?si=nEysWQHzafRpxfRpreply",
      "> They are often touted as off road capable with high utility, and I see them in pristine condition on city streetsWhen I was off-roading and traveling a lot of dirt trails with my truck I would also wash it, wax it, and keep it in pristine condition when I got back home.What did you expect? That we\u2019d leave the mud on it forever, never wash it, and all of the side panels would be bashed in? If you\u2019d climb under the truck (as I do for oil changes) you could see a lot of scrapes and dings from rocks, but I avoid damaging the side and front because that\u2019s very expensive to repair.Anyway, most of the trucks sold today aren\u2019t sold in the off-road trim. They\u2019re sold with features like lower clearance air dams up front for better fuel economy, on-road tires for better road noise and fuel economy, and commonly in 2WD trims. A new F150 can get 25mpg on the freeway even without the hybrid option.I work remote so my truck isn\u2019t used for commutes. I frequently haul things in the bed. I off road with friends.Yet that doesn\u2019t stop some people from making snide remarks about driving a truck. Some people love being angry at truck drivers and imagining they\u2019re all just making irrational choices. They won\u2019t be happy until we\u2019re driving to Home Depot or UHaul every other weekend to rent a truck or trailer instead of parking one in our driveways.It doesn\u2019t stop them from calling me up and asking for help moving furniture when they need it, though. :)reply",
      "You seem very intent (here, and in the loneliness thread) on projecting your own experiences as the baseline on which things should be evaluated.It is a known fact that the vast majority of truck owners rarely ever use the truck bed. Millions of school pickups happening on massive trucks - and SUVs - are not ceasing to happen because you loaded your own with a pile of grass. People buy them because they\u2019re \u201csafer\u201d, comfortable and look good. This is coming from research data for years now,\nand not only in the USA.It can be hard to relate to changes happening at societal scale that don\u2019t affect your own microcosm, but how else can we be aware of it, and act on, if not through data, averages and trends?reply",
      "> It is a known fact that the vast majority of truck owners rarely ever use the truck bed.Just want to point out that big pickups are really about the hauling capacity, it's not like their beds are much bigger than a modern Ford Ranger. An F250 can safely pull 10 tons, and a dually F450 can pull 20t. Usually you aren't towing...but when you need to haul nontrivial loads you need a big truck.reply",
      "> It is a known fact that the vast majority of truck owners rarely ever use the truck bed.I'm not here to defend brodozers, but you cannot possibly prove this statement. That a _pickup truck_ isn't hauling the majority of the time it is on the road is not some new thing. But of course there are more pickup trucks on the road than ever, so if you argument is aggregate time of all pickup trucks not doing truck things is the highest its ever been is certainly true, but you'd probably have to go back to before the 80s for that number to actually be meaningfully different per truck.reply",
      "Not sure what you mean by \"prove this statement\" but answering questions like this is exactly why organizations do consumer research.

I was very much \"yeah, they're probably only here for a quick job, probably didn't have time for that\", because I'm a Londoner and, well, that's what we do in London.My colleague is like \"No, that's not acceptable\", and he literally pulls out his phone and calls the police.

      "I have about two weeks of using Claude Code and to be honest, as a vibe coding skeptic, I was amazed. It has a learning curve. You need to learn how to give it proper context, how to chunk up the work, etc. And you need to know how to program, obviously. Asking it to do something you don't know how to do, that's just asking for a disaster. I have more than 25 years of experience, so I'm confident with anything Claude Code will try to do and can review it, or stop and redirect it. About 10-15 years ago, I was dreaming about some kind of neural interface, where I could program without writing any code. And I realized that with Claude Code, it's kind of here.A couple of times I hit the daily limits and decided to try Gemini CLI with the 2.5 pro model as a replacement. That's not even comparable to Claude Code. The frustration with Gemini is just not worth it.I couldn't imagine paying >100$/month for a dev tool in the past, but I'm seriously considering upgrading to the Max plans.reply",

I'm hearing from Senior devs all over thought, that Junior developers are just garbage at it. They product slow, insecure, or just outright awful code with it, and then they PR the code they don't even understand.For me the sweet spot is for boilerplate (give me a blueprint of a class based on a description), translate a JSON for me into a class, or into some other format. Also \"what's wrong with this code? How would a Staff Level Engineer white it?\" those questions are also useful. I've found bugs before hitting debug by asking what's wrong with the code I just pounded on my keyboard by hand.reply",

      "Human readable (informal) proofs are full of gaps that all have to be traced back to axioms e.g. gaps that rely on shared intuition, background knowledge and other informal proofs.It's somewhat like taking rough pseudo code (the informal proof, a mixture of maths and English) and translating that into a bullet-proof production app (the formal proof, in Lean), where you're going to have to specify every step precisely traced back to axioms, handle all the edge causes, fix incorrect assumptions, and fill in the missing parts that were assumed to be straightforward but might not be.A major part is you also have to formalise all the proofs your informal proof relied on so everything is traced back to the initial axioms e.g. you can't just cite Pythagorus theorem, you have to formalise that too.So it's an order of magnitude more difficult to write a formal proof compared to an informal one, and even when you have the informal proof it can teams many years of effort.reply",

Ever increasing house prices, caused by the underlying power imbalance between capital and labour, is the root of all evil in the Anglosphere. It will not stop until wages are restored to pre financial crisis levels and assets and wealth are taxed at a level equal to or higher than work. Until that happens, the wealthy will continue to squeeze everybody else out of a life.[1]: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_resu...reply",

This really isn\u2019t comparable to land, in that the scarcity isn\u2019t imposed by the laws of nature or laws written by government, it is scarcity entailed by a (predominantly) private social arrangement where competing arrangements are permitted, but have thus far failed in the market.> the orbitals in the skyOrbit is huge and while it is getting more congested, I don\u2019t think that congestion is (as yet) a significant barrier to new entrants. The primary barrier remains the launch costs. The governments of major spacefaring powers don\u2019t see orbital slots as a revenue source, their regulation of them is purely about avoiding conflict, and the fees they charge are about recovering the cost of that regulation, not contributing to general revenue. Some equatorial states tried to claim geostationary orbit slots over their territory as part of their territory, in order to charge for access to them - but the claim failed because the major spacefaring states refused to accept it, and these states lacked the geopolitical power to compel anyone else to take this claim seriously-and, anyway, with the growth of LEO constellations, geostationary orbit arguably isn\u2019t as economically important as it was when those claims were first assertedreply",
      "At some point, I would imagine the distinction between capital and land becomes blurry, though. Economic rent can be had from either if the barrier to competition is high enough.Domain names are a good example, because as skissane said, you could just make another DNS root. The trouble is convincing people (browsers) to use it. The problem in attempting to overturn Facebook isn't mainly the coding, either, but having a critical mass care. Those barriers don't seem like absolutes the way land is; they're just very high, high enough for those who control them to extract economic rent.reply",

      "I remember my first music (note reading) lesson.  We got a paper with sentences, and the teacher replaced each word with either 'titi' or 'ta' and we had to repeat it.  Our homework for that week was an A4 paper full of words and sentences, and we had to replace them with 'titi' or 'ta' as made sense from context.  I somehow managed to get a good grade, but it confused the hell out of me, and made me think of giving up music as too hard.  I remember it bothering me the whole week.The second lesson, the teacher says: 'Now we have to learn some hard words.  The 'ti' is called a quarter note, and the ta is a half note'.  Finally, the whole thing started to make sense to me.  Then the teacher says: 'But don't try to understand that, these are very hard words for adults, just memorize them and do what makes sense from context.'  Trough that lesson, the teacher kept stressing that same message:  Too hard, adult words, do what makes sense instead and use the hard words only to impress the outsiders.I've kept a deep distrust for teachers telling me to do what makes sense in context. I've always kept asking for the actual rules and correct words instead, however complicated they were.  It happened a few times later in life too, like my economy teacher giving 'debit' and 'credit' guidelines based on vibes without telling they should be balanced, with subtraction being complicated math according to her.reply",
      "My first piano teacher was very artsy and whimsical, she and I simply were never able to establish any connection as I have always been a very logical learner. I suffered under her for almost 10 years as a child while she tried to teach music to me in the way that made sense to her.My latest piano teacher was a professor and specialised in the pedagogy of music so he was more than equipped to deal with an overthinking logical type music student like myself.Learning music and an instrument can and should be quite intuitive. And as performing is quite expressive, music can attract people that stereotypical creative type who just wants to play and feel music. But the study of music theory and classical music are quite rigorous subjects and they can be attractive to logical thinkers who thrive learning all the nomenclature. But knowing the nomenclature is not strictly necessary to play music and so you have this disconnect between the very diverse spectrum of people drawn to music.In fact, there is a certain inescapable intuitiveness to music and the professor taught me to really learn to via feeling and establish feedback loops that always come back to the sound and my own motor sensations (did you achieve the sound you want while playing freely?). You can't really logic things like that and if anything it's more like a sport than something you can science when every person's body and dimensions are different.I am now having singing classes and singing is even more mindbending than piano has ever beenreply",
      "That resonates for me. I spend lot of time teaching volunteers. Early on, I encourage them to learn the skill from me, but also take any opportunity to have others explain and demonstrate the same thing to them. I tend to work from first principles, explaining how the pump functions and why that means water goes in here and out there, and what different configurations of valves are therefore valid and which ones will never do anything useful. Others often explain it in terms of which valves to turn in which order to achieve a given outcome.Neither is right or wrong. Most people will be left pretty cold by one explanation while the other will land neatly into a hole in their brain shaped perfectly for it. Which one is which will be different for each person.I think that there\u2019s value in gearing educational settings towards having a plurality of instructors available on each subject and letting students gravitate towards the ones that work for them.reply",
      "My elementary school music teacher was very schoolmarmish and prim -- almost like Ana Gasteyer's Bobbi Mohan-Culp character -- and had training in opera performance. She also did the \"ta\"/\"titi\" thing, but backwards. She would, for example, teach us a ta/titi sequence -- writing the notes on the board, having us sing/perform it several times -- and only then reveal the lyrics to be \"Baa Baa Black Sheep, have you any wool?\" Her years of musical training taught her that getting the details right early on was super important. I'm incredibly thankful for having had teachers like this.It sounds like the teachers you've had who said \"just do what makes sense\" have punted on the act of teaching itself. They either don't know how to, or are unwilling to, do the hard work of providing detailed instruction and holding kids to a high standard of learning. That's just sad to see man.reply",

      "For any parents of small kids here, I have to mention the book Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons. We went through it while my kid was in kindergarten, and after that, I absolutely believe what I've heard from parents who did it successfully a bit earlier. And it didn't prevent my kid from figuring out how to use context or recognize full words. Reading English is a lot, and kids are resourceful; if we teach the 'slow' but reliable way to read, they'll be happy to feel out shortcuts.The toughest thing was getting a reliable bit of time each day to sit down and do it. Routine, cajoling, and rewards were all involved. So was keeping it lighthearted; the kid has to be on board! Each lesson has straightforward exercises then a brief story, very short at first, longer later in the book. We'd do the exercises and one read of the story, then kid would read the story to my partner. We started in September, and I remember by Halloween the kid was reading candy wrappers. After finishing it, the next big thing was finding stories the kid genuinely liked to keep it going. Continuing to read together after the lessons ended helped: for a while, kids will keep running into lots of new exceptions to the usual rules, etc.English spelling and pronunciation are a lot, and the book is also, implicitly, a catalog of the tricks English plays on kids and other learners. Part of the book uses a semi-phonetic alphabet where e.g. ee and sh/ch/th have distinct glyphs, but it all still looks enough like English that the jump to regular writing later in the book is doable for the kid. Even with that alphabet, the book has to teach common words like \"is\" and \"was\" as exceptions (with s sounding like z). Decades later one can forget little kids deal with all this and eventually handle it like second nature.The book's originator thought that you could teach math with a broadly similar approach--breaking things down into very small steps and practicing them in isolation then in larger tasks--and doing that was part of his career, but I haven't found similar teach-your-kid book for arithmetic/basic math. If such a book did exist I'd've given it a try!reply",

      "Cool but ... this also sounds like hording behavior. The number of things I've saved over the years only to throw them away years later and realize that saving them in the first place was a waste of time.In the 90s my friend's mom would video tape AMC movies. She had 300+ tapes. Maybe she had a few rare ones but now all those movies are available on demand either legally or illegally and in much better quality. Another friend kept all of his 1980s computer magazines (Byte, etc...) and moved these extremely heavy boxes through 30+ years of moves. I doubt he ever opened a single magazine since the moment he saved them. Then they all appeared on The Archive and he finally got rid of them.To be clear, I have a few youtube videos saved on my local storage. I'm just thinking that saving every video I watch reminds me of the things I've personally over-saved.Actually that reminds me. I met up with the magazine saving friend recently which is when I verified that he finally got rid of his stash. It made me think about things I'm still saving that if I reflect on I know I will never actually look at. For example I have box of about eight 3.5 inch floppy disks from my Amiga days. The odds that I'm going to get an Amiga or download an Amiga emu and get a drive to read those are close enough to zero that I should throw them away.

      "> The trap is that both OOP hierarchies and FP \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" create premature crystallization of domain understanding into rigid technical models. When domains evolve (and they always do), this coupling demands expensive refactoring.At least when you refactor your types, the compiler is going to pinpoint to the line all the places where you now have missing pattern checks, unhandled nulls, not enough parameters, type mismatches etc.I find refactoring in languages like Python/JavaScript/PHP terrifying because of the lack of this and it makes me much less likely to refactor.Even with a test suite (which you should have even when using types), it's not going to exhaustively catch problems the type system could catch (maybe you can trudge through several null errors your tests triggered but there could be many more lurking), working backwards to figure out what caused each runtime test error is ad-hoc and draining (like tracing back where a variable value came and why it was unexpectedly null), and having to write + refactor extra tests to make up for the lack of types is a maintenance burden.Also, most test suites I see do not contain type related tests like sending the wrong types to function parameters because it's so tedious and verbose to do this for every function and parameter, which is a massive test coverage hole. This is especially true for nested data structures that contain a mixture of types, arrays, and optional fields.I feel like I'm never going to understand how some people are happy with a test suite and figuring out runtime errors over a magic tool that says \"without even running any parameters through this function, this line can have an unhandled null error you should fix\".

Migrating to new business rules while simultaneously running the old and new system is the hard part. I don't find static typing helps or hurts me in particular.
