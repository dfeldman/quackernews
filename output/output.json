      "As a Hetzner bandwidth enjoyer affected by this, this is why (HN cough) multi-cloud/dedi k3s is great, because if you get rug pulled you just migrate to another provider with better prices.That said, $1/TB for bandwidth overage seems pretty fair. I empathize with the complaining but if the new price is such a ripoff everyone should be recommending what cloud VM provider they're migrating to for a better deal.\n \nreply",
      "I use OVH (VPS\u2019s specifically), which offers unlimited bandwidth. In my experience they\u2019ve been both reliable and affordable which is a rarity. I run a few applications that require high amounts of bandwidth, so silly caps like the ones that Hetzner are imposing are a non-starter for me\n \nreply",
      "That's what a friend said also. If you look beyond the marketing material, hoever, the ToS says:> OVHcloud reserves the right to restrict the VPS Service bandwidth to 1 Mbps (1 Megabit per second) until the end of the current billing period in cases of excessive use by the Clientbut it advertises with \"unmetered\"... so is a meter attached by which they can tell whether your bandwidth use is excessive or not? Would they eat those costs for you?I checked out some numbers. Quoting myself from chat history:> it begs the question: what's \"excessive\"? I dunno but if they charge $5/month for the VPS and, while AWS may be ~1/3rd cheaper [than some other thing], that's still on the order of 70$/month. And AWS has insane economies of scale working for them, maybe their cost price is $7/month if they don't need to have a competitive price but that's still a loss then> I bet you'd win the lawsuit where [OVH] falsely advertised with unmetered 500mbps and a terms of service saying \"excessive\", so when you transfer 2 TB/day on a connection advertised to be capable of 500mbps\u00d724h = 5.4TB/day... that's reasonable right? But then you're having a lawsuit over a 5$/month VPS\n \nreply",
      "OVH is the most set and forget experience I've ever had.  They email me maintenance notices 3 or 4x a year, but I don't think I've ever had any downtime.  It just stays happily humming along for years.  I think I pay something like 60 a year for it.\n \nreply",
      "OVH and reliable, in the same sentence? They're cheap, so suitable for projects you don't mind going poof.Personal anecdote. A few years ago, I lost a lot of sleep on a domain renewal at OVH. Their incompetence was mind-boggling. A less common tld was the only slightly challenging bit. After a week of calling and emailing, and on the verge of the domain lapsing, I gave up and sent someone to the tld registry with cash.Also, do search for OVH SBG2 should you have missed that.\n \nreply",
      "OVH's infrastructure is absolutely very reliable.The pain begins when you need support. Just like you, I have lost a lot of sleep over domains held hostage by their incompetence (for almost a year in one instance). Lesson learned, never use OVH for domains.The support for their dedicated servers is just as bad, mind you, but short of a hardware failure you really don't need them. I have several years of uptime on all my current services.So for personal projects their vps/dedicated is still a fantastic value.\n \nreply",
      "> OVH's infrastructure is absolutely very reliable.Well except that time one of their datacenters burned down, likely due to insufficient fire suppression, and they kept the data backups in the same building as the originals so they were also lost.https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ovhcloud-ordered-...These reports criticize OVHcloud for having no fire prevention system and no power cut-off on the site, for using wooden floors, and for a free-cooling design that created airflows that spread the fire. The reports also say that water was detected near electrical systems before the fire broke out.It takes quite a while to regain trust after shitting the bed that badly.\n \nreply",
      "They can be terrible.  But it is dirt cheap. So if you use their stuff in a way that you can recover somewhere else if they have issues, you save a lot.As you mentioned I would stay away from them for things like domain hosting.  Just use them for cheap compute, etc.\n \nreply",

Unfortunately they\u2019ve made a feeble attempt to dress this change up in the name of \u201cfairness\u201d.With the new tariff structure, we want to make conditions for our customers around the world as fair as possible \u2026 Until this change, customers who have used fewer resources have covered the costs, in a way, for other customers who have used much more resources. We want to make things more balanced. The new prices will give our customers the best possible price for the resources they use.I\u2019d love to see a better explanation for why prices are increasing so much in exchange for such a significant drop in bandwidth allotments.

(And, boy, can they move!)Bring earplugs.There's more to the sports than the pinnacle of achievement. There are innumerable classes within drag racing, something for everyone. It's not a \"solved\" problem by any means. Folks will continue to try and master the start, getting traction, keeping that beastly powered thing straight in the lane, trying to not choke on their beating heart that has surged into their throat.Bracket racing is a hoot where folks bring whatever they like, and they're rated by time (i.e. a \"time bracket\"). Whether you're running a old 60's hot rod, a Jet Powered car, or anything else, if you can run within the time, it's pretty much fair game. And it can be fun to watch, and real fun to participate in.Racing of all kinds can be a fun culture to be around.\n \nreply",

In the U.S., baseball tickets can be had for reasonable prices in small markets late in the season, and the seats don\u2019t matter. You want to experience the emotion and energy firsthand. Unlikely to turn you into a fan, but the experience will be one you think on for years to come.2/ A live sporting event where the outcome makes no difference, like your local minor league team. Again, seats don\u2019t matter\u2014you want to feel the buzz and sense of community.3/ Amateur musical theatre. The on-stage talent is often top-tier, while the rest of the production is endearingly amateurish. But the enthusiasm, honesty, and agenda-free earnestness of the production will make you love people a little more.4/ Opera\u2026You get the point. Any endeavor where a group of people dedicate huge energy\u2014often their lives\u2014into making a show, along with their incredibly enthusiastic fans, is worth your time. Also, sometimes you can get corn dogs or drink wine out of a plastic cup.\n \nreply",

The Escape PHEV, however, has all the other advantages except the instant torque; I've never had a vehicle so able to finely control power and the eCVT smooths out the kind of lagging a conventional transmission has on hills and the like.

The power is in it's growl, not necessarily it's bite. I don't know how you replicate that in an electric vehicle and I think that feeling transfers to the racetrack as well.

      "Context is a challenge for LLMs, but the challenge feels of a different quality to me, than the challenge of incorporating local context into automated decision-making AI like algorithmic hiring, banking decisions, and real estate valuation like Zillow. These examples are more like \"pre-LLM\" machine learning, and it's not clear to me that LLMs are inherently limited in the same way. If anything, I think there's potential for LLMs to more flexibly handle a much broader variety of local contextual information by ingesting natural language rather than non-LLM machine learning systems where how to featurize or represent this information is typically quite bespoke. Take the neighbors' practicing death metal in their garage every Sunday and its impact on house valuation - it feels harder to get a non-LLM ML system to \"understand\" this, as a very sparse \"feature\", than an LLM.\n \nreply",

The problem is that many SaaS products want to integrate AI into their systems in ways that strike this balance, but in my experience, giving individuals an OpenAI account and letting them figure out how to automate the boring parts of their job is more effective.

      "This one is crazy. I made up a silly topology problem which I guessed wouldn't be in a textbook (given X create a shape with Euler characteristic X) and set it to work. Its first effort was a program that randomly generated shapes, calculated X and hoped it was right. I went and figured out a solution and gave it a clue.Watching it \"think\" through the answer is surreal and something I haven't felt since watching GPT-2 write punchlines for jokes.Here's the lightbulb moment it \"realizes\" what the clue meant:> For example, if you have a covering space of degree n, then the Euler characteristic of the covering space is n times the Euler characteristic of the base space.> But I'm not sure how that relates here.> Alternatively, perhaps it's about considering the Euler characteristic of a quotient space.> But again, that might be too advanced for this problem.> Maybe I'm overcomplicating things.> Let me go back to the beginning.> The problem says: \"Consider the Euler characteristic of the tetrahemihexahedron and of a genus g torus. Then consider the additive property of the Euler characteristic. Then try again.\"> So, perhaps it's simply about adding their Euler characteristics together.I'm under no illusions about how LLMs are built and operate, but this really feels somehow more \"real\" and person-y than previous generations, even when you coax them into an answer.I'm going to go and try having GPT-4o roleplay a student solving the problem and see if it's genuinely different.

      "My mom is an avid traveler who takes a ton of photos and puts them on albums she then shares with the family, and a while ago she was asking if I had a solution so she could have a website where all her albums are listed. She wanted to not have to share a new link each time, and have people easily look up older ones.I didn't have any easy solution and this looks promising, congrats!A few dealbreaker things I can share:- she has lots of albums already on gphoto. She'd need to easily import them.- she makes heavy use of the map and text blocks you can add in gphoto albums, which makes each album a kind of travel diary. I don't get the sense these are supported in your product yet, these would be required for her.- she doesn't have a ton of videos but sometimes she does have a few.- I'd have some concerns about the longevity of your product - if she invests time into it she wants to be able to look back at the albums in 10-20 years time. Having a convenient way to export the albums would be reassuring to me.- I think she has a few 1000s photos in those albums, so your highest tier would be too low for her, if there was a way to buy storage that might suit her usage better (though she has a hobbyist budget).It might be technically difficult and you rejected that path already, but I'm thinking an ideal way for her would be to keep editing her albums in gphotos and sync them to your site, which would take care of the longevity concerns and allow her to keep using the interface she knows (if you  linked directly to the pics/vids on google server that would eliminate the cost of storing pictures for you, but I assume that's impossible or prohibited by google's tos).Anyway, just sharing my use case in case that's useful but congrats on launching and on the good looking product!\n \nreply",

      "They are hardwired on Macbooks. From Daring Fireball, quoting an email from an Apple engineer.> All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. [\u2026]> So, no, I don\u2019t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED.
