      "Totally agree.And a great example that truth is complicated, expensive and uncomfortable. It's much easier to postulate an evil nation-state entity with a bad plan (without evidence) than to dig through the thicket of this article. It's much cheaper as well, certainly in terms of time and knowhow. And it's also much more comfortable to claim you're the victim and have uncovered a conspiracy, rather than realize this was just the result of the patchwork typical of engineering.Kudos to the author.\n \nreply",
      "I would also add, it's not _unreasonable_ to be wary of something when a tool like a virus scan pops up a warning. The jargon used to explain what the executable is doing is gibberish to any 'normal' user, there's no way for them to know it's listing stuff you'd more or less expect it to be doing.Of course, there's a bit of a jump from that to making bold claims about what it's doing, but the initial concern was understandable.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, the insane takes spread faster but it takes more time and resources to look into it than just come to conclusions early.The worst thing is this creates an environment where most people are either completely credulous and buy into everything or completely incredulous and think everything is unfounded.

      "This was an fun read, as someone who's both a Korean BW player and a speech recognition researcher.It's interesting to note that the original Korean transcription already has many errors, seemingly (and impressively) corrected by LLMs later on. For example, 12 \uc548\ub9c8\ub2f9 \ube4c\ub4dc (12 courtyard build) is actually 12 \uc55e\ub9c8\ub2f9 \ube4c\ub4dc (12 frontyard build), which might have been more understandable to BW players. Similarly \ud22c\uc5d0\ucc98\ub9ac \ube4c\ub4dc (processing-at-two build? makes no sense lol) should have been transcribed \ud22c\ud574\ucc98\ub9ac \ube4c\ub4dc (two-Hatchery build).Therefore it may also be helpful to directly feed the slang dictionary into Whisper's inference process using contextual biasing. There are lots of ways to do this, but the simplest would be to increase the probability of slang words in the dictionary in the final prediction layer of Whisper by a constant factor. This is fairly easy to implement, for example by using HuggingFace's library: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/internal/generat...\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for the added context on the builds! As \"foreign\" BW player and fellow speech processing researcher, I agree shallow contextual biasing should help. While not difficult to implement, most generally available ASR solutions don't make it easy to use. There's a PR in ctranslate2 implementing the same feature so that it could be exposed in faster-whisper: https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2/pull/1789\n \nreply",
      "I am a StarCraft fan and I have no idea what a courtyard or a frontyard is supposed to be! However I do know that the names of buildings, units, technologies, and strategies are usually heavily abbreviated in English. Perhaps the same is true in Korean? A 12 barracks build would usually just be called \"12 rax\", a two hatchery mutalisk build would be called \"2 hatch muta\", and a three hatchery hydralisk timing attack / all-in would be called \"3 hatch hydra bust\".\n \nreply",
      "I believe the equivalent term used in English (exhibited in the new translation) is \"natural\", short for \"natural expansion\", which refers to the obvious location where the player should build their first expansion. It sounds like the term used in Korean for this concept literally means \"front yard\" rather than matching the English term.\n \nreply",
      "Makes sense. And presumably the 12 means that you expand to your natural (\"courtyard\") with your 12th worker unit (probe, in the case of protoss).\n \nreply",
      "Not the parent commenter but not always. 9 pool just means you build a spawning pool at your main, for instance. This worker-prefix building build-order naming system also breaks down once people start referencing builds like 2 rax academy, 3 hatch muta, etc.\n \nreply",
      "Right, \"9 pool\" means build a spawning pool when you have 9 workers. So \"12 courtyard\" means build an expansion when you have 12 workers.\n \nreply",
      "I think strictly \"9 pool\" means you build the pool when you have 9 supply. However, before you build a spawning pool, the only thing you can build that consumes supply is workers.\n \nreply",
      "A lot of Korean slang is a little different. Source: not Korean but have been in the English community a long time and picked some stuff up.\"1rax double\" is equivalent to \"1rax expand\" or \"1rax CC\". They use multi or double to mean expand in the early game. Instead of \"cheese\" or \"all-in\" they use \"pil-sal-gi\" which means ace/joker card or \"han-bang\" which means an army or attack on few resources.I am not sure what short-hand they use for barracks, gateway, etc.\n \nreply",
      "Instead of \"cheese\" or \"all-in\" they use \"pil-sal-gi\" which means ace/joker cardThat\u2019s a really interesting one to me! One thing I\u2019ve noticed is that Koreans do not seem to have the same hangups / negative attitude towards cheese strategies as westerners do!\n \nreply"

The overwhelming majority of professional players, teams, and tournaments (as well as most of the passionate audience and community) are based in Korea, and have been for 20+ years.

Will it survive/thrive? How the content is going to evolve? What does this means in terms of global cultural influence? Will we see internationalized Chinese content dominating it?

This might mean most content you see is English, if you're interested in English content. However it matters where the video was geographically uploaded from. If you upload a tiktok video and check the stats you'll see most views are from your region or country.Tiktok shows videos locally, then regionally and then finally worldwide if yoo have a big hit.It would be interesting to know what fraction of the English content people see is posted geographically from within America.\n \nreply",

      "Lived in Switzerland and this is really not true.What I've learned is that since Switzerland has 3 official languages (German, French and Italian) children and teens at school focus on learning one of the other two regions they are not from.In particular this leads to French and Italian cantons to be moderately fluent in each other's language. Strikingly when I lived in Lausanne, more people knew Italian than English. English was really not on their radar (plus, add that francophones are kind of elitist when it comes to languages and don't really like to consume content that is not in french).In German speaking Switzerland proficiency in English was still subpar from most of the rest of Europe when walking in a shop or going to a restaurant.\n \nreply",
      "Not to derail, but when I was in Switzerland, I found the German Swiss to be far more elitarian about NOT learning French, than the other way around.  And French Swiss being a minority, they kinda got treated as other or less-than in the bulk of Switzerland. But all German Swiss are at least willing to try English, while the French Swiss tend to avoid English, so maybe that's where the vibe comes from?\n \nreply",
      "For both you and OP, first of you, thank you for \"elitarian\", but even after reading the definition, I still think you both meant \"elitist\".And even though I probably tend to agree with both of you, it's kinda funny to blame French or German speakers about being elitist against English speakers, of which native speakers are notoriously monolingual :-)\n \nreply",
      "I don't blame anyone, I'm Italian and I'm fluent in French, English and Polish besides Italian.I'm just saying that in the French part of Switzerland English wasn't a given among any generation and it neither was common in the German/Italian parts too if you exclude the expats.And yes, francophone tend to be very elitist about consuming exclusively french content, regardless of them being from France, Switzerland or Belgium.\n \nreply",

      "Incidentally, this automatic branch-if-zero from LLVM is being improved.First of all, a recent LLVM patch apparently changes codegen to use CMOV instead of a branch:https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/102885Beyond that, Intel recently updated their manual to retroactively define the behavior of BSR/BSF on zero inputs: it leaves the destination register unmodified.  This matches the AMD manual, and I suspect it matches the behavior of all existing x86-64 processors (but that will need to be tested, I guess).If so, you don't need either a branch or CMOV.  Just set a register to 32, then run BSR with the same register as destination.  If the BSR input is nonzero, the 32 is overwritten with the trailing-zero count.  If the BSR input is zero, then BSR leaves the register unmodified and you get 32.Since this behavior is now guaranteed for future x86-64 processors, and assuming it's indeed compatible with all existing x86-64 processors (maybe even all x86 processors period?), LLVM will no longer need the old path regardless of what it's targeting.Note that if you're targeting a newer x86-64 version, LLVM will just emit TZCNT, which just does what you'd expect and returns 32 if the input is zero (or 64 for a 64-bit TZCNT).  But as the blog post demonstrates, many people still build for baseline x86_64.(Intel does document one discrepancy between processors: \"On some older processors, use of a 32-bit operand size may clear the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit destination while leaving the lower 32 bits unmodified.\")\n \nreply",

      "> You might even convince yourself that these questions are \u201cprivacy preserving,\u201d since no human police officer would ever rummage through your papers, and law enforcement would only learn the answer if you were (probably) doing something illegal.Something I've started to see happen but never mentioned is the effect automated detection has on systems: As detection becomes more automated (previously authored algorithms, now with large AI models), there's less cash available for individual case workers, and more trust at the managerial level on automatic detection. This leads to false positives turning into major frustrations since it's hard to get in touch with a person to resolve the issue. When dealing with businesses it's frustrating, but as these get more used in law enforcement, this could be life ruining.For instance - I got flagged as illegal reviews on Amazon years ago and spent months trying to make my case to a human. Every year or so I try to raise the issue again to leave reviews, but it gets nowhere. Imagine this happening for a serious criminal issue, with the years long back log on some courts, this could ruin someones life.More automatic detection can work (and honestly, it's inevitable) but it's got to acknowledge that false positives will happen and allocate enough people to resolve those issues. As it stands right now, these detection systems get built and immediately human case workers get laid off, there's this assumption that detection systems REPLACE humans, but it should be that they augment and focus human case workers so you can do more with less - the human aspect needs to be included in the budgeting.But the incentives aren't there, and the people making the decisions aren't the ones working the actual cases so they aren't confronted with the problem. For them, the question is why save $1m when you could save $2m? With large AI models making it easier and more effective to build automated detection I expect this problem to get significantly worse over the next years.\n \nreply",

The key idea is to project intense light patterns onto a rotating vial of photo-sensitive resin, causing polymerization where the cumulative dose of these patterns reaches the polymerization threshold. We formulate the pattern calculation as an inverse light transport problem and solve it via physically based differentiable rendering. In doing so, we address long-standing limitations of prior work by accurately modeling and correcting for scattering in composite resins, printing in non-symmetric vials, and supporting unusual printing geometries. We also introduce an improved discretization scheme that exploits the ray tracing operation to mitigate resolution-related artifacts in prints. We demonstrate the benefits of our method in real-world experiments, where our computed patterns produce prints with an improved fidelity.\n \nreply",

      "Cool idea, pretty good execution, but your UI is confusing.1. There's so much happening on the screen between your app's UI and the fake UI with the dark patterns that it's confusing. IMO you should show the objective first, and then let the user click to reveal the fake UI and challenge. For example, simply show, \"Challenge #1 \u2014 Find the button that actually lets you cancel the subscription.\" Then have a button that says, \"Start Challenge.\" When that button is clicked, then reveal the UI.2. Give me some context. If you just say, \"Find the button that actually lets you cancel the subscription,\" that's not really enough. You should set the scenario. \"Imagine you're subscribed to an app, but you don't want to be subscribed anymore. So you sign into the app and click the cancel button. It loads a new screen. How do proceed from here to finalize your cancelation?\"3. Don't tell me the answer in advance. Naming the first challenge \"Color Confusion\" tells me the answer.4. Don't auto-advance steps. I had no idea that I auto advanced. I changed tabs, then came back, then was scrolling down looking for the next step button. Just let me manually click to the next step as a user.

      "Any idea when Mermaid diagrams will render outside of web browsers?https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/2485<rant>\nAside, I'm the author of KeenWrite (https://keenwrite.com/), a Markdown text editor that allows embedding diagrams using the triple-backtick syntax. Here's a GraphViz example:    ``` diagram-graphviz\n    digraph {\n        rankdir=\"LR\";\n        a -> b -> c;\n    }\n    ```\n\nKeenWrite parses the `diagram-` prefix then passes the word `graphviz` to Kroki (https://kroki.io/), which has an API for rendering a variety of ASCII diagrams, including Mermaid. Meaning, if Kroki adds a new diagram type, KeenWrite gets it for free (without modification).In Markdown, formatting a source code snippet entails using the standard syntax for code blocks:    ``` graphviz\n    digraph {\n        rankdir=\"LR\"\n        a -> b -> c;\n    }\n    ```\n\nGitHub created a de facto standard for Mermaid diagrams that breaks the convention of having triple-backticks followed by a language identifier to show the source code for that language in a monospace font.
