      "Many years ago I was sitting at a red light on a secondary road, where the primary cross road was idle.  It seemed like you could solve this using a computer vision camera system that watched the primary road and when it was idle, would expedite the secondary road's green light.This was long before computer vision was mature enough to do anything like that and I found out that instead, there are magnetic systems that can detect cars passing over - trivial hardware and software - and I concluded that my approach was just far too complicated and expensive.Similarly, when I look at computers, I typically want the ML/AI system to operate on a structured data that is codified for computer use.  But I guess the world is complicated enough and computers got fast enough that having an AI look at a computer screen and move/click a mouse makes sense.reply",

Instead of hoping students will learn ARM it's more reasonable to leverage Arduino's simple nature to act as an on-ramp for more low level developers. I wouldn't be surprised if Arduino IDE saw a revamp to better support jumping the gap between the Arduino to Snapdragon.ST and TI do the same thing with their boards too and it's not a bad strategy.reply",
      "People are making so much of this when it seems so much simpler. Qualcomm likes  buying high-margin businesses, and Arduino is a high-margin business. Gross margin on their boards is over 90% (hence why you can buy a Chinese clone of a $30 board for $3) and this trend shows no signs of slowing down. The TI equivalent of the $30 Arduino Uno is $5, and it's a true gateway product.reply",
      "You seem to equate gateway product = affordable but, IMHO, a gateway product is something that people who are not in the field are likely to stumble upon. I recently saw Arduino kits for kids at a small local bookstore, I can imagine someone thinking \"hey this electronic thingy looks cool I'll buy one for my niece's birthday\". On the flip side, people who don't know anything about microcontrollers are not going to look online for Chinese Arduino clones.reply",

(National/Transnational).reply",
      "The commons were actually fairly well regulated by community norms that were well documented and established. The creation of the notion of the tragedy of the commons was quite possibly propaganda so that large land owners could consolidate and enclosed the commons under the guise that they could manage it better especially after traditions were disrupted.reply",
      ">  The commons were actually fairly well regulated by community norms that were well documented and established.Not really. You are correctly citing the enclosure acts as a historic example, but that was not beginning or the end of history. It was just a recent, location-specific historic moment when big English landlords won in the millenia-old power struggle between peasant and landlord.Control of the commons - land and the resources buried in it - has been a point of contention and bloodshed for as long as recorded human history. It's a pendulum that swung back and forth, but has always had bad actors making personally-profitable, socially-impoverishing decisions.For an alternative example of how things have gone in other places, look at the blood feuds between ranchers and farmers[1] in the American west, concerns over upstream and rainfall water rights in literally any part of the world that relies on irrigation, or, the varied situations where existing landlords politically won the struggle... Or lost it in the 20th century.As for well-established[2]...---[1] The enclosure acts echo this farmer/rancher dichotomy, actually. Feudal lord/serf relationships have the lords derive wealth from having ever more serfs doing ever more labour-intensive agriculture on their land. The enclosure acts, however, were intended to drive the peasants from their land, because in the case of England, the lords figured out that they can derive way more wealth from turning over their land to low-labour grazelands for sheep. And the way they could do that was to use the law as a cudgel to drive out their tenants at sword and gunpoint.[2] They were only well-established for particular points in history. Prior to William the Conqueror arriving in England, and stealing all the land in it for himself and his mercenaries, there were also 'well-established' land use norms - that greatly limited the power and ownership-of-land granted to lords and petty kings. The Norman conquest turned all that over - into a different 'well-established' equilibrium - that was then, again, turned over into a 'well-established' equilibrium after the passage of the enclosure acts.reply"

You can design it lots of different ways from light to heavy, but once you go beyond Dunbar's number you can't just rely on common sense and informal communication.

It's more than a product list, it\u2019s a cultural artifact, offering a window into the aesthetics, values, and lifestyle of its time. I still keep their old catalogs, and I\u2019m not alone.reply",

We got it freely every year with post, and I dreamed as a kid to have such houses and flats which could be seen in them. The brand stuck me so well, that it\u2019s my go to furniture store, since I moved out from my parents. I wanted to read it again last year to have some ideas for my new flat, and I was devastated when I\u2019ve figured out that it\u2019s not printed anymore. Even as I\u2019ve been continuously online for 24-25 years, a digital \u201cversion\u201d of it will never be the same. I won\u2019t ever read it just for fun, which we did back then so many times (my whole family), that it became utterly damaged until the next year\u2019s edition came.

      "> And behind the scenes, work on the next catalogue had already begun \u2013 a process lasting several months and involving planning, construction of interiors, photography and filming, all led by catalogue manager Mia Olsson Tun\u00e9r.It is naive to assume printing costs are the only costs involved.I feel comfortable assuming IKEA had a better understanding of the economic fundamentals of the catalogue than HN commenters.reply",
      "No one is assuming printing costs are the only costs to produce the catalogue. The point of pricing the catalogue at printing costs is to cover the marginal cost of offering the catalogue for sale. The fixed costs of producing the calendar are incurred either way.reply",
      "A company I worked for stopped doing physical catalogs too - after having done so for a very long time. The cost to produce the catalog was insane, and had quite a bit of dedicated staff working on it full-time. Making a catalog is a specialized skillset, and has little overlap with the business' core competencies, such as website administration.Over time, the revenue attributed with the physical catalog declined year over year. People said they wanted the catalog, but it didn't translate into attributable sales. The ones that did order from the catalog were often the smallest, insignificant orders the company took in. The website and online advertising are where customers gravitated towards, and remain today.The amount of people that actually want a physical catalog, even for IKEA, I would wager pales in comparison to the amonut of people that want to browse the catalog on their phone or tablet. Pricing changes, stock comes and goes, products get discontinued, colors/materials are changed, etc. The website is always up-to-date, the physical catalog... is not.When I read comments like yours, I interpret them as people wanting nastolgic items more than marketing materials or ordering guides. The costs for the company are just too high to produce those anymore; well over $2 per catalog someone up-thread mentioned - we're talking more like $10-$20+ these days (not accounting for anything except print costs) for a full-color, glossy/professional catalog with hundreds of pages.I have serious doubts IKEA printing catalogs today would garner any new business. They would give away (or perhaps sell) some copies to existing, long-time customers with a fond memory of the brand and their catalogs - and I'm afraid that's it.reply",

In a standard shop you'd call that a night stand, or a coffee table, or a kids' table or living room's low table etc.If you think of it as shopping for an environment (same as half of the in-shop experience: they'll show you full rooms where you can see products fit together) it makes sense.

The catalogue has always reflected the age and its views on interior design and everyday living, especially in Sweden, but in recent decades also internationally.

It seems more logical to start with a problem (\"how to solve linear equations?\" \"how to find intersections of lines?\"), show its solution graphically, and then present the computational method or algorithm that provides this solution. Doing it backwards is a little like teaching the chain rule in calculus before drawing the geometric pictures of how derivatives are like slopes.reply",
      "Author here \u2013 I think you're probably right. I wrote the Gaussian elimination section more as a recap, because I figured most readers have seen Gaussian elimination before, and I was keen to get to the rest of it. I'd love to hear if other folks had trouble with this section. Maybe I need to slow it down and explain it better.reply",
      "Loved the article, and also the shoutout to Strang's lectures.I agree with the order, the Gaussian should come later I almost closed the article - glad I kept scrolling out of curiosity.Also I felt like I had been primed to think about nickles and pennies as variables rather than coefficients due to the color scheme, so when I got to the food section I naturally expected to see the column picture first.When I encountered the carb/protein matrix instead, I perceived it in the form:[A][x], where the x is [milk bread].Tso I naturally perceived the matrix as a transformation and saw the food items as variables about to be \"passed through\" the matrix.But another part of my brain immediately recognized the matrix as a dataset of feature vectors, [[milk].T [bread].T], yearning for y = f(W @ x).I was never able to resolve this tension in my mind...reply",
      "I really like this, and I think one way to make it even more clear would be to use other variable letters to represent breads and milks, because their x\u2019s and y\u2019s somehow morph into the x\u2019s and y\u2019s that represent carbs and protein in the graph.reply",

However, these things drive me crazy at the same time. You cannot have -4 nickels. In pure math with only x and y, sure those values can be negative. But when using real world examples using physical objects, no, you cannot have a negative nickel. Maybe you owe your mate the value of 4 nickels, but that's outside the scope of this lesson. Your negative nickels are not in another dimension (because again, the math works that way). You want to help people understand math with real world concepts but then go and confuse things with pure math concepts. And these negative nickels are still not even getting into imaginary nickels territory like you have square root of -4 nickels.reply",

      "I think everyone should read the post from ARC-AGI organisers about HRM carefully: https://arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysisWith the same data augmentation / 'test time training' setting, the vanilla Transformers do pretty well, close to the \"breakthrough\" HRM reported. From a brief skim, this paper is using similar settings to compare itself on ARC-AGI.I too, want to believe in smaller models with excellent reasoning performance. But first understand what ARC-AGI tests for, what the general setting is -- the one that commercial LLMs use to compare against each other -- and what the specialised setting HRM and this paper uses as evaluation.The naming of that benchmark lends itself to hype, as we've seen in both HRM and this paper.reply",
      "Not exactly \"vanilla Transformer\", but rather \"a Transformer-like architecture with recurrence\".Which is still a fun idea to play around with - this approach clearly has its strengths. But it doesn't appear to be an actual \"better Transformer\". I don't think it deserves nearly as much hype as it gets.reply",
      "Right. There should really be a vanilla Transformer baseline.With recurrence: The idea has been around: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03819There are reasons why it hasn't really been picked up at scale, and the method tends to do well on synthetic tasks.reply",
      "Wow, so not only are the findings from https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734 (posted on HN a while back) confirmed, they're generalizable? Intriguing. I wonder if this will pan out in practical use cases, it'd be transformative.Also would possibly instantly void the value of trillions of pending AI datacenter capex, which would be funny. (Though possibly not for very long.)reply",
      "Any mention of \"HRM\" is incomplete without this analysis:https://arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysisThis here looks like a stripped down version of HRM - possibly drawing on the ablation studies from this very analysis.Worth noting that HRMs aren't generally applicable in the same way normal transformer LLMs are. Or, at least, no one has found a way to apply them to the typical generative AI tasks yet.I'm still reading the paper, but I expect this version to be similar - it uses the same tasks as HRMs as examples. Possibly quite good at spatial reasoning tasks (ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 are both spatial reasoning benchmarks), but it would have to be integrated into a larger more generally capable architecture to go past that.reply",
      "That's a good read also shared by another poster above, thanks! If I'm reading this right, it contextualizes, but doesn't negate the findings from that paper.I've got a major aesthetic problem with the fact LLMs require this much training data to get where they are, namely, \"not there yet\"; it's brute force by any other name, and just plain kind of vulgar. Although more importantly it won't scale much further. Novel architectures will have to feature in at some point, and I'll gladly take any positive result in that direction.reply",
      "Evolution is brute force by any other name. Nothing elegant about it. Nonetheless, here you are.Poor sample efficiency of the current AIs is a well known issue - but you should keep in mind what kind of grisly process was required to give you the architecture that makes you as sample efficient as you are.We don't know yet what kind of architectural quirks enable this sample efficiency in the human brain. It could be something like a non-random initialization process that confers the right inductive biases, a more efficient optimizer, recurrent background loops... or just more raw juice.It might be that one biological neuron is worth 10000 LLM weights, and a big part of how the brain is so sample efficient is that it's hilariously overparametrized.reply",
      "Yeaaaaaah, I kinda doubt there's much coming from evolutionary biases.If it's a matter of clever initialization bias, it's gotta be pretty simple to survive the replication via DNA and procedural generative process in the meat itself, alongside all of the other stuff which /doesn't/ differentiate us from chimpanzees. Likely simple enough that we would just find something similar ourselves through experimentation. There's also plenty of examples of people learning Interesting Unnatural Stuff using their existing hardware (eg, echolocation, haptic vision, ...) which suggests generality of learning mechanisms in the brain.reply",
      "The brain implements some kind of fairly general learning algorithm, clearly. There's too little data in the DNA to wire up 90 billion neurons the way we can just paste 90 billion weights into a GPU over a fiber optic strand. But there's a lot of innate scaffolding that actually makes the brain learn the way it does. Things like bouba and kiki, instincts, all the innate little quirks and biases - they add up to something very important.For example, we know from neuroscience that humans implement something not unlike curriculum learning - and a more elaborate version of it than what we use for LLMs now. See: sensitive periods. Or don't see sensitive periods - because if you were born blind, but somehow regained vision in adulthood, it'll never work quite right. You had an opportunity to learn to use the eyes well, and you missed it.Also, I do think that \"clever initialization\" is unfortunately quite plausible. Unfortunately - because yes, it has to be simple enough to be implemented by something like a cellular automata, so the reason why we don't have it already is that the search space of all possible initializations a brain could implement is still extremely vast and we're extremely dumb. Plausible - because of papers like this one: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20057If we can get an LLM to converge faster by \"pre-pre-training\" it on huge amounts of purely synthetic, algorithmically generated meaningless data? Then what are the limits of methods like that?reply",
      "That analysis provided a very non-abrasive wording of their evaluation of HRM and its contributions. The comparison with a recursive / universal transformer on the same settings is telling.\"These results suggest that the performance on ARC-AGI is not an effect of the HRM architecture. While it does provide a small benefit, a replacement baseline transformer in the HRM training pipeline achieves comparable performance.\"reply"

      "Hey guys, I learned electronics from a nobel laureate!Throughout my physics career including PhD, analog electronics was the most difficult but probably also the most rewarding class to me. I fondly remember staying until 2am in broida at ucsb trying to get a filter to work, getting a few hours sleep, then being back in the lab before sunrise. Of course, this was mostly the result of procrastination, but damn were those good times.One thing that really bothered me then was the idea of a current source. I was perfectly happy with a voltage source, perhaps naively(1). But a current source seemed magical. I was asking Martinis about this and he seemed dumbfounded that I didn't understand. Of course, the answer is feedback. And, of course, good voltage sources also require feedback. But he was so familiar with feedback control he didn't even consider saying that's whats happening, while I never even heard of controls.Long story short, sometime later I asked to join his lab as an undergrad researcher. He said no, and to this day I think it's because I didn't understand current sources. Or maybe I was too late, or maybe the A- (see the aforementioned procrastination). That led me to asking a biophysicist, and therefore I became a biophysicist instead of condensed matter/QI/QC. In hindsight, I think this was fortunate. I would've never considered biophysics, which has been one of the loves of my life since then. Who knows, maybe I would've been just as happy with quantum stuff. I'm working through Mike and ike now and find it fascinating.Funny enough, after my PhD, I co-founded a startup in industrial control & automation. Now I understand feedback quite while, and thus current sources, albeit many years too late.(1) Of course, good voltage sources vary their resistance just like good current sources vary their voltage. My best guess as to the reason I was more bothered by the current sources is that I was so familiar with voltage sources with confidently claimed constant voltages (batteries). Not a very good reason, I should've questioned it more.  In practice, it's much easier to make a near ideal voltage source (very high resistance) than a near ideal current source (0  resistance).reply",
      "\"Of course, good voltage sources vary their resistance just like good current sources vary their voltage. \"Did you mean to say \"good voltage sources vary their current just like good current sources vary their voltage\"?(I know nobody really cares, and I promise I'll seek help for whatever neurological condition I seem to have.)reply",
      "There are two different ways to produce a voltage source.  The first is to put a variable resistor in series with the power source, which you can adjust to control the voltage.  This works, but dissipates a lot of heat.  The second is to put a switch in series with the power source and a capacitor in parallel with the load, then switch the power source on and off very rapidly and use the duty cycle to control the voltage.  This is how modern switching power supplies work.  In actual practice, there are also inductors in the circuit which cause resonance, and allow the switching to happen when there is no current flowing through the switch.  This is how modern switching power supplies can be so efficient.reply",
      "Ok, thanks. But I was calling attention to a point in the previous comment that makes it difficult to see a kind of \"dualism\" between idealized current sources to idealized voltage sources. Idealized current or voltage sources don't necessarily have any series resistance, and it doesn't matter how they're realized.reply",
      "Your point is well taken.  My guess was that the OP had implementation in mind when they wrote \"good voltage sources vary their resistance\".Or that might have just been a mistake.reply",
      "I'm certainly no electrical engineer, and I see how the nice duality was lost in my description.  \nYes,  I was thinking about the ones I'd actually worked with, where the resistance was the control knob. I haven't done much electronics since, so my recollection isn't perfect. I have recently been doing some esp-32 control projects where I just used some power supply I bought. I should look into how it works!Edit- I just looked up switching power supplies and remembered that I did actually know about those!reply",
      "Ideal current sources would also be pretty terrifying. Set it to even a \"measly\" 50mA and go poke someone with the output...reply",
      "Oops, meant \"understand feedback quite well*\", can't edit for some reason?reply",
      "Interesting, this constant current source notion.For a design without feedback, and in an energetically inefficient way, maybe this can work too:1. Determine what will be the maximum resistance of the \"current consumer\" part of your circuit throughout its operation.2. Prepare a resistor several magnitudes larger than the resistance above.3. Connect to the resistor above a (huge) voltage source so that the resulting current is the one you target for your current source4. Put the \"current consumer\" part of your circuit in series with the large resistor.reply",
      "This is pretty much what we do to apply small bias currents to our superconducting circuits. The signals are small (<1 uA), and the power is dissipated outside of the cryostat, so this method is very simple and effective. The voltage and resistors don\u2019t even need to be that huge, ~10 MOhm or below, and correspondingly, <10 V.reply"

Devoret and John M. Martinis, used a series of experiments to demonstrate that the bizarre properties of the quantum world can be made concrete in a system big enough to be held in the hand. Their superconducting electrical system could tunnel from one state to another, as if it were passing straight through a wall. They also showed that the system absorbed and emitted energy in doses of specific sizes, just as predicted by quantum mechanics.Quantum mechanics describes properties that are significant on a scale that involves single particles. In quantum physics, these phenomena are called microscopic, even when they are much smaller than can be seen using an optical microscope.
