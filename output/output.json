      "Many years ago I backed the Jolla Tablet, which never shipped and they never gave me a refund. At the time the company kept pretending like things were perfectly fine with every update right until they let everyone know that the project was being cancelled. There was zero transparency and accountability, and from that day I vowed to never support this company ever again. I would've been fine if the project had failed and they had been transparent and honest about their ongoing struggles with every update, but the complete lack of transparency was too much for me.I don't know if the values and leadership at Jolla have changed since then, but it's not a company that I would trust to deliver and communicate honestly in good faith.reply",
      "Not just the lack of transparency, they went bankrupt after the tablet fiasco (never refunded most of the people) and bought by some investment firm connections to the Russian state (not the thing you want from a privacy-friendly product / system) what they tried to keep secret.AFAIK they have bought by some other company (again) since then, but they have basically nothing. Most of their Sailfish OS is actually closed source (like AOSP vs all the apps from Google), they don't have any hardware, they just re-flash some phone from Sony.I had high hopes for them, but now wouldn't even touch them with a stick. Pixel with GrapheneOS seems to be a much better choice and maybe even closer to their original ideologies.reply",
      "I'm not familiar with the background here.There was a blog post committing to refunds given sufficient cashflow, posted in 2017:<https://blog.jolla.com/summer-2017-ceo-update/>HN discussion:  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14637748>It does appear that Jolla has shipped other products (SailfishOS, the Jolla Phone in 2013, some tablets, and others, see Wikipedia:  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolla#Sailfish_OS_products>).Since 2017 the company has gone through bankruptcy and re-launched.It should be remembered that kickstarter / crowdfunded ventures, as with any other, are speculative and risky.  A good-faith effort to deliver on spec is itself credible, and the landscape is littered with the husks of far more failures, especially in the mobile space, including from former (and current) giants:  RIM, Palm, Microsoft, Mozilla, Canonical, off the top of my head).  Google and Apple are the only present significant  OS options standing, Apple (again) and Samsung dominate hardware, though there's increasing competition largely from China.reply",
      "I can't recall how many tablets were shipped, but I was lucky enough to get mine.reply",
      "FWIW, I actually received my Jolla Tablet (albeit delayed). Your are right that Jolla is sometimes less transparent and professional than one would expect. \nHowever, I realize that Jolla is also under much more scrutiny by the community than other tech companies, and some people demand ridiculous levels of transparency/quality/features.reply",
      "I don't think that expecting to get the product you pay for (even if it's just crowdfunding) is too much? Or putting them under too much scrutiny? I don't think people expect less from any other tech company? It's just really basic stuff.reply",
      "I don't mean be rude, but outside the SV bubble, funding is extremely hard and when companies are on the brink \"ethics\" becomes a luxury you can't really afford.That's not an argument for not complaining against what was done, but given what they're doing - fighting two Goliaths that have 10000x the resources, I just wish people would give them another chance.https://blog.jolla.com/jolla-tablet-closure/reply",
      "I would seriously consider SailfishOS if it shipped on decent (recent) hardware that was available in the US. The last good experience I had with it was on the Xperia XA2, but that hardware was turned into ewaste by the VoLTE requirements of US carriers. Although they claim to run on more recent Xperia phones, they don't have full hardware support, and aren't on the most recent models. If I'm going to pay for a phone OS and hardware to support it, I want some assurance it won't be total jank.reply",
      "Well you'll need to talk to your monopolistic carriers then. US mobile innovation is dead for the foreseeable future due to them, all new innovation is happening in China and other SE Asian markets.You just need to be a good consumer and buy that iPhone that Verizon orders you to have with their blessing.reply",
      "What you are describing is much more accurate of the US cell carriers before the iPhone. I remember paying $20/mo (to the carrier) for a terrible mail application on a feature phone. The iPhone's AT&T deal saved us from that situation.What are some of the innovations you're referring to?reply"

Together they invested around 1 billion USD to the project and created an open source based operating system called MeeGo, which was used as a basis for several devices, such as the iconic Nokia N9. Although the Nokia N9 became the beacon of open source operating systems, Nokia decided to end the project and chose instead to continue with Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone OS. The rest of that is another story.The passionate team behind MeeGo refused to quit working on the project they\u2019ve believed in.

      "There is a general problem with rewarding people for the volume of stuff they create, rather than the quality.If you incentivize researchers to publish papers, individuals will find ways to game the system, meeting the minimum quality bar, while taking the least effort to create the most papers and thereby receive the greatest reward.Similarly, if you reward content creators based on views, you will get view maximization behaviors.  If you reward ad placement based on impressions, you will see gaming for impressions.Bad metrics or bad rewards cause bad behavior.We see this over and over because the reward issuers are designing systems to optimize for their upstream metrics.Put differently, the online world is optimized for algorithms, not humans.reply",

      "Using coding agents to track down the root cause of bugs like this works really well:> Three out of three one-shot debugging hits with no help is extremely impressive. Importantly, there is no need to trust the LLM or review its output when its job is just saving me an hour or two by telling me where the bug is, for me to reason about it and fix it.The approach described here could also be a good way for LLM-skeptics to start exploring how these tools can help them without feeling like they're cheating, ripping off the work of everyone who's code was used to train the model or taking away the most fun part of their job (writing code).Have the coding agents do the work of digging around hunting down those frustratingly difficult bugs - don't have it write code on your behalf.reply",
      "I understand the pitch here (\"it finds bugs! it's basically all upside because worst case there's no output anyways\"), but I'm finding some of these agents to be ... uhhh... kind of agressive at trying to find the solution and end up missing the forest for the trees. And there's some \"oh you should fix this\" stuff which, while sometimes isn't _wrong_, is completely besides the point.The end result being these robots doing bikeshedding. When paired with junior engineers looking at this output and deciding to act on it, it just generates busywork. Not helping that everyone and their dog wants to automatically run their agent against PRs nowI'm trying to use these to some extent when I find myself in a canonical situation that should work and am not getting the value everyone else seems to get in many cases. Very much \"trying to explain a thing to a junior engineer taking more time than doing it myself\" thing, except at least the junior is a person.reply",
      "Sometimes you hit a wall where something is simply outside of the LLM's ability to handle, and it's best to give up and do it yourself. Knowing when to give up may be the hardest part of coding with LLMs.Notably, these walls are never where I expect them to be\u2014despite my best efforts, I can't find any sort of pattern. LLMs can find really tricky bugs and get completely stuck on relatively simple ones.reply",
      "Doing it yourself is how you build and maintain the muscles to do it yourself. If you only do it yourself when the LLM fails, how will you maintain those muscles?reply",
      "I agree, and I can actively feel myself slipping (and perhaps more critically, not learning new skills I would otherwise have been forced to learn). It's a big problem, but somewhat orthogonal to \"what is the quickest way to solve the task currently in front of me.\"reply",
      "If the LLM is able to handle it why do you need to maintain those specific skills?reply",
      "Should we not teach kids math because calculators can handle it?Practically, though, how would someone become good at just the skills LLMs don't do well? Much of this discussion is about how that's difficult to predict, but even if you were a reliable judge of what sort of coding tasks LLMs would fail at, I'm not sure it's possible to only be good at that without being competent at it all.reply",
      "When models start to forage around in the weeds, it's a good idea to restart the session and add more information to the prompt for what it should ignore or assume. For example in ML projects, Claude gets very worried that datasets aren't available or are perhaps responsible. Usually if you tell it outright where you suspect the bug to be (or straight up tell it, even if you're unsure) it will focus on that. Or, make it give you a list of concerns and ask you which are valid.I've found that having local clones of large library repos (or telling it to look in the environment for packages) is far more effective than relying on built-in knowledge or lousy web search. It can also use ast-grep on those. For some reason the agent frameworks are still terrible about looking up references in a sane way (where in an IDE you would simply go to declaration).reply",
      "So you feed the output into another LLM call to re-evaluate and assess, until the number of actual reports is small enough to be manageable. Will this result in false negatives? Almost certainly. But what does come out the end of it has a higher prior for being relevant, and you just review what you can.Again, worst case all you wasted was your time, and now you've bounded that.reply",
      "Just ask it to prioritize the top ones for your review. Yes, they can bikeshed, but because they don\u2019t have egos, they don\u2019t stick to it.Alternatively, if it is in an area with good test coverage, let it go fix the minor stuff.reply"

      "Worth mentioning that while this was very nice work by a Helix enthusiast, it was proposed as a replacement for the official docs and mostly rejected, and for good reasons IMO. An instructive discussion!https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12127#issuecommen...It's rarely a good idea to do a bunch of work on a big change to an open source project in a direction that has not been validated by the maintainers. Or at least, if you do, do it for your own education and don't have high expectations that it will be merged. The contributor in question had a very good attitude about it.reply",
      "> It's rarely a good idea to do a bunch of work on a big change to an open source project in a direction that has not been validated by the maintainers.While this is good advice in general, it doesn't tell the whole story in the case of this specific project.  The helix maintainers have a track record of giving very slow \"no\"s and wasting contributor time.  They encourage contributors to fix various odds and ends, until the PR has been nit picked to death, and then finally the concept is rejected.  Totally backwards, good project leadership would front-load the conceptual yay-or-nay before reviewing any actual code.reply",
      "I think you have it backwards in two ways:1. While Helix dev is on the slow side, I think what you\u2019re describing as specific to Helix is in fact the typical case in open source2. In this case the author did a bunch of work up front and the maintainers said no almost immediately after the PR was postedI agree they could be faster to say no, but I think part of it is that the maintainers would have to agree themselves and as far as I know they are not getting together to come to consensus about random Helix PRs every day.reply",
      "I really would love to move to helix but they can be\u2026 stubborn about what gets into the core. And if you start having to go to a plugin (which isn\u2019t even possible last I looked) to get table stakes features in, it kind of defeats the purpose of a modern batteries included modal editor.  But it\u2019s still a cool thing I\u2019m glad exists.reply",
      "> but they can be\u2026 stubborn about what gets into the core.Yes, as an onlooker who is similarly cautious about moving to helix, I consider this to be a major risk factor.\nI've watched the maintainers waste dozens of hours of contributors' time, and leave the project with no improvement afterwards.\nI would actively warn against anyone trying to contribute to the project.\nThe maintainers simply don't know how to run an open source project, and it's unlikely you will be able to accomplish anything.\nIt's fine for a project to not accept contributions, and if you don't have the skillset to leverage contributor labor, then it's better to be upfront about it.That being said, I hope they figure out the plugin system, or someone forks the project to add the missing table stakes features.reply",
      "> The maintainers simply don't know how to run an open source projectCan you explain why you feel this way? From an outsider\u2019s perspective, Helix seems like an impressive piece of software with a growing community. I don\u2019t see what the maintainers are doing so wrongreply",
      "Being able to build high quality software alone is a distinct skill from being able to make a group of engineers productive.  Neither are soft skills, it comes down to how the software is architected and how well you can produce, understand, and communicate designs with the other collaborators.I do consider helix to be an impressive piece of software, and I agree that the user base is growing, not necessarily the set of effective maintainers though.  The maintainers don't seem to have any aptitude for coordinating engineering effort.  That would be fine, if they were honest and direct about it.  SQLite is a project which does not accept contributions, I think helix should do the same.Put differently, I don't expect the large community to have a meaningfully positive effect on the quality of the software, because the maintainers have not demonstrated the competency to effectively utilize that labor.  I expect helix to continue slowly improving at whatever rate the maintainers can make important changes themselves.reply",
      "It\u2019s a ridiculous and inflammatory claim to make about a clearly successful project with an enthusiastic community of users who love it. The maintainers have day jobs and have a clear and narrow vision that they don\u2019t want to mess up by carelessly expanding the pool of maintainers. That is the entire explanation!reply",
      "This is what killed all the momentum that Elm had at one point. While that's a language and not an entire editor, it does serve as an illustrative example of being far too strict about accepting changes to core.reply",
      "For projects without funding, there is typically a trade off between a polished coherent product, which means saying no a lot, and a bloated product that has enough maintainer bandwidth to stay around.  The second means saying yes to things which may not make the product better, in order for newcomers to feel bought into the project and want to maintain it.For something like an editor, where whole features can be turned off by default, there's quite a bit of leeway to add bloat and get newcomers to buy in, without actually making the product worse.For a programming language, a feature in the language has to be used by everyone.  So the leadership has to say no a lot to keep the language high quality, and that makes it hard to get newcomers to buy in.Unfortunately you can't have it both ways without paying people to maintain the project.  Elm was good because the leadership said no...often.\nIt's dead because the leadership said no so often that no one wanted to help maintain it.   No one is going to waste their free time working on a project that won't accept their ideas, nor should they.A language like Go doesn't have this trade off.  If the Go leadership rejects a google employee's proposed language change, the employee still has to do maintenance chores as directed to keep their job.reply"

      "One of the biggest contributors I've had in the past for SQLite blocking was disk fragmentation.We had some old Android tablets using our app 8 hours a day for 3-4 years. They'd complain if locking errors and slowness but every time they'd copy their data to send to us, we couldn't replicate, even on the same hardware. It wasn't until we bought one user a new device and got them to send us the old one that we could check it out. We thought maybe the ssd had worn out over the few years of continual use but installing a dev copy of our app was super fast. In the end what did work was to \"defrag\" the db file by copying it to a new location, deleting the original, then moving it back to the same name. Boom, no more \"unable to open database\" errors, no more slow downs.I tried this on Jellyfin dbs a few months ago after running it for years and then suddenly running into performance issues, it made a big difference there too.reply",
      "That's much more likely flash degradation than actual fragmentation. Did you use cheap tablets with eMMC storage?reply",

      "> You can VACUUM INTO, but standard vacuum won\u2019t rewrite the whole db.This is not true.

      "In SQLite, transactions by default start in \u201cdeferred\u201d mode. This means they do not take a write lock until they attempt to perform a write.You get SQLITE_BUSY when transaction #1 starts in read mode, transaction #2 starts in write mode, and then transaction #1 attempts to upgrade from read to write mode while transaction #2 still holds the write lock.The fix is to set a busy_timeout and to begin any transaction that does a write (any write, even if it is not the first operation in the transaction) in \u201cimmediate\u201d mode rather than \u201cdeferred\u201d mode.https://zeroclarkthirty.com/2024-10-19-sqlite-database-is-lo...reply",

For example, an electric oven requires between 1,000 and 5,000 watts of power, while electric stove burners have an average power consumption of 1,000 to 3,000 watts per burner. If you want to use an oven and one electric stove burner simultaneously, you need a solar array of at least 32 square meters in optimal weather conditions - just to cook. 1You can overcome this problem by storing solar power in lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries. If these batteries are powerful enough, they can temporarily provide you with a higher power supply than your solar array can deliver. Batteries are also necessary"
