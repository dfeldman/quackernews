      "I know it is tangential, but this about his old system caught my attention:  With that system, I could set the amplifier\u2019s analog volume knob such that the max volume out of the streamer corresponded to my actual maximum preferred listening volume, giving me access to the full range of Spotify or AirPlay\u2019s volume controls.\n\nAssuming an analog input, this might result in a noticable quality reduction at low volumes.\n \nreply",
      "Tangential fun fact: amps have a fixed gain, because it's hard to make a variable gain without distortion [1]. The volume knob doesn't control amplification, in fact it controls an attenuation stage, because it's easier to make variable attenuation with low distortion.[1] that's why there were so many different \"classes\" of amps, they're all making different tradeoffs about how they're doing the amplification.\n \nreply",
      "That helps explain why the \"volume\" as represented on disk in the debug bundle as \"attenuation\" and was measured in negative dB.\n \nreply",
      "In this case, I was using the optical out from a WiiM mini into a Yamaha amp. I don't know much about digital audio, but I know that I was able to control the volume of the WiiM's digital output with that setup.On the other hand, I use a Schiit Asgard at my desk, where I have it connected to my Mac via USB-C. In that setup, I have no control over the volume level going in to the Asgard. MacOS just disables the software volume control when I'm using that audio output.\n \nreply",
      "Reducing excessively before the DAC and high gain after the DAC is far more likely to result in quality reduction, due to quantization error. Having reasonable levels before the DAC and just the right amount of gain after the DAC (e.g., via an amplifier's attenuator setting) is the best possible scenario. So TFA's prior setup may have been superior in this regard, depending on how the digital volume control on the new speakers is implemented (i.e., before the DAC, or as a VCA after the DAC).Where this breaks down is if the analog signal path (after the DAC) consists of something noisy after the attenuator. Passive attenuation (like built into an amp, or the master fader of a mixer, etc.) won't add noise, but something active like an outboard EQ would. The attenuation to set desired max level must be completely last (before power amp) to avoid noise.\n \nreply",
      "While I\u2019m all for physical controls, especially ones that self-adjust to reflect the state of the remote device at all times, I wonder if the author just doesn\u2019t know you can finely adjust volume in iOS control center by force/long pressing and then dragging.\n \nreply",
      "This is a great point! When I'm using AirPlay, that feature is really useful. I'm more often using Spotify Connect though, where I'm limited to either using the physical volume buttons on my phone, the small slider in the desktop app, or the slider that's many clicks in to the Spotify mobile app.In reality though, this project is more about the fun of it than about it being a really pressing need.\n \nreply",
      "It also works when using Spotify Connect on your iOS device. If you can use your volume buttons to control it you can also adjust it with the slider in the control centre.\n \nreply",
      "You're correct, TIL!That's really helpful to know. At this point though, I'm excited enough to build a volume knob that I'll probably still do it.\n \nreply",
      "Why do speakers even expose a web api in the first place? It\u2019s just easily available without any security?Hope this person segmented this device away from other devices. The lack of basic security in the IoT space is astounding to me.\n \nreply"

      "The author is claiming that Bayesians vary along two axes: (1) whether they generally try to inform their priors with their knowledge or beliefs about the world, and (2) whether they iterate on the functional form of the model based on its goodness-of-fit and the reasonableness and utility of its outputs.

But the author, who knows far more academic statisticians than I do, explicitly says that he had the same belief and \"was shocked to learn that statisticians didn\u2019t think this way.\"\n \nreply",
      "The no iteration thing is very real and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even for particularly bad reasons. We iterate on models to make them better, by some definition of better. It\u2019s no secret that scientific work is subject to rather perverse incentives around thresholds of significance and positive results. Publish or perish. Perverse incentives lead to perverse statistics.The iteration itself is sometimes viewed directly as a problem. The \u201cgarden of forking paths\u201d, where the analysis depends on the data, is viewed as a direct cause for some of the statistical and epistemological crises in science today.Iteration itself isn\u2019t inherently bad. It\u2019s just that the objective function usually isn\u2019t what we want from a scientific perspective.To those actually doing scientific work, I suspect iterating on their models feels like they\u2019re doing something unfaithful.Furthermore, I believe a lot of these issues are strongly related to the flawed epistemological framework which many scientific fields seem to have converged: p<0.05 means it\u2019s true, otherwise it\u2019s false.edit:Perhaps another way to characterize this discomfort is by the number of degrees of freedom that the analyst controls. In a Bayesian context where we are picking priors either by belief or previous data, the analyst has a _lot_ of control over how the results come out the other end.I think this is why fields have trended towards a set of \u2018standard\u2019 tests instead of building good statistical models. These take most of the knobs out of the hands of the analyst, and generally are more conservative.\n \nreply",
      "> Iteration itself isn\u2019t inherently bad. It\u2019s just that the objective\n  > function usually isn\u2019t what we want from a scientific perspective.\n\nI think this is exactly right and touches on a key difference between science and engineering.Science: Is treatment A better than treatment B?Engineering: I would like to make a better treatment B.Iteration is harmful for the first goal yet essential for the second. I work in an applied science/engineering field where both perspectives exist. (and are necessary!) Which specific path is taken for any given experiment or analysis will depends on which goal one is trying to achieve. Conflict will sometimes arise when it's not clear which of these two objectives is the important one.\n \nreply",
      "There is no difference between comparing A versus B or B1 versus B2. The data  collection process and and the mathematical methods are (typically) identical or subject to the same issues.E.g.: profiling an existing application and tuning its performance is comparing two products, it just so happens that they\u2019re different versions of the same series. If you compared it to a competing vendor\u2019s product you should use the same mathematical analysis process.\n \nreply",

In particular, the article's definition of pragmatic Bayes says that \"the model should be consistent with knowledge about the underlying scientific problem and the data collection process,\" which I don't consider the norm in ML at all.I do think ML practitioners in general align with the \"iteration\" category in my characterization, though you could joke that that miscategorizes people who just use (boosted trees|transformers) for everything.[0] https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volum...\n \nreply"

      "In my opinion, plotting chromaticity on a Cartesian grid \u2014 by far the most common way \u2014 is pretty misleading, since chromaticity diagrams use barycentric coordinates (and to be clear, I blame the institution, not the author). The effect is that the shape of the gamut looks skewed, but only because of how it's plotted; the weird skewedness of a typical XYZ chromaticity diagram doesn't represent anything real about the data.Instead, a chromaticity diagram is better thought of as a 2D planar slice of a 3D color space, specifically the slice through all three standard unit vectors. From this conception, it's much more natural to plot a chromaticity diagram in an equilateral triangle, such as the diagram at [1]. A plot in a triangle makes it clear, for instance, that the full color gamut in XYZ space isn't some arbitrary, weird, squished shape, but instead was intentionally chosen in a way that fills the positive octant pretty well given the constraints of human vision.[1]: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/777501/why-is-th...\n \nreply",

I hope I come across as respectful and unpatronizing as possible (and apologize since I probably don't.)While we have intelligent people discussing pie-in-the-sky solutions, barely-related tangential issues, and even misdirected injection attacks, the causes of the housing crisis are not only well-known to (honest) economists [1], but can be verified by looking at the market pre- and post-1970.It's hard enough to tune in to the correct analysis in the cacophony. When once in a blue moon it comes from the bully pulpit [2], it still gets shot down in a sea of misdirection.[1] https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/0...[2] https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/obama-takes-on-zoning...\n \nreply",

      "Genuine Question, why can't we just charge a federal property tax 3-4x local property taxes for individuals who own >1 property (which would likely be distributed back to the locality, specifics not important), apply the same rules we do for pass-through taxation to mitigate loopholes, and automatically charge this elevated rate for properties owned by non-natural persons?

      "> Genuine Question, why can't we just charge a federal property tax 3-4x local property taxes for individuals who own >1 property (which would likely be distributed back to the locality, specifics not important)I am that person.I own two duplexes in addition to my primary residence, for a total of four residential rental units \u2013 all 2/1s made up of ~750 sq ft each. Those additional properties that I own provide housing to 6 humans who can't purchase, or just prefer not to.What you're proposing would result in one of two moves from my end:1. I sell both properties and let someone/some entity (who doesn't work and/or manage the properties themselves, have any relationship with the tenants, will push rents to market prices immediately, etc etc) deal with it.2. I scrape the lots, stand up single family homes, take my gains and walk inside ~18 months. That puts the 6 humans mentioned above out into a (very tight, <= 1% vacancy rate) rental market that'll bump their monthly rent expense by ~25% minimum and, overall, very likely reduce the headcount of humans housed.Either way, it's a high level hit to individuals, the market, whatever. It doesn't result in any gains or economic corrections to the RE market.> (which would likely be distributed back to the locality, specifics not important)That's already happening in my scenario. I own & operate a General Contractor LLC entity that issues invoices to me, the property owner.

Separately, my personal rental income is taxed appropriately at the federal level.> I think this would just price in the externalities of corporate versus natural person living in a property for a locality.You know what else can be priced in? Or wildly swing a market into affordability, normality, etc? Letting people build things. My lots are massive, but they consist of sheds and lawns instead of multiplying my units and housing more people.It's impossible in my local market, and that's why it's carrying the <= 1% residential vacancy rate it has for 15+ years, and why rents are increasing at wild rates that no industry/job market inside 80 miles can support. Economics 101 says supply vs demand etc etc. Easy layups for anyone with half a brain. We don't have to modify anything outside of city/county zoning & the ability to infill everywhere.\n \nreply",

      "Some of the greatest creations were made because of the creators refusal to compromise their vision.That said, Linux is inherently a community project, and compromise is required for any large community. I think the fragmentation is the biggest thing holding back desktop Linux. Not only are talented people solving some of the same problems 30 different ways, but in doing so, ignoring other problem that need solving. This can also be viewed through the lens of user choice and allowing the best ideas to win. The larger issue (imo) is it creates a huge learning curve for new users just to get started. Windows and macOS don't have this problem, because there is a singular vision and the company choose a solution to move forward with that all the employees get behind. All that fragmentation and testing is done internally, and the public doesn't have to deal with it, for the most part.\n \nreply",
      "> fragmentation is the biggest thing holding back desktop LinuxI'm not convinced.The main thing holding back desktop Linux is buggy upstream software not working, which usuall affect all distros. LibreOffice Writer didn't have a rastered ruler for 10 years, no quality GPU driver for some AMD card, some KDE app segfaults, some Python app has a value unexpectedly being None, a kernel minor version update just completely broke the version of VirtualBox on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS -- those were and often still are daily problems that no amount of distro hopping or fragmentation consolidation will fix.The \"large\" distributions justify their existence by differing in key aspects that cannot be consolidated:* Corporate vs community, e.g. RedHat/SuSE/Ubuntu vs. Debian* Fundamental concepts, e.g. NixOS/Guix vs. everything else* Up-to-date-ness, e.g. Arch vs. DebianThere are some aspects of fragmentation that _could_ be consolidated by better software and more configurability, e.g.* Source vs. binary, e.g. NixOS provides both* Choice of libc, e.g. NixOS ships glibc by default but you can easily get much software with musl, and it's technically possible (but needs more community power) to provide a whole system running musl with a single line of config for the end user* GUI vs CLI configurationFor the small distros, they are niche enough that them merging with another distro doesn't have a huge consolidation effect overall. For example, I do not see how Void Linux and Alpine Linux merging would significantly improve the life of the mass of Ubuntu users, or signficiantly advance \"Linux on the desktop\".It's true that there's some amount of duplicate work occurring, but much of that is often easily re-used across distros. For example, if in NixOS something doesn't work with the newest version of musl, one would usually check if Alpine already solved that and if yes, swiftly copy the approach. The main work is for the _first_ one to figure it out, and that work is necessary even if there was only 1 distro.Reducing distribution fragmentation isn't what makes \"Linux on the desktop\" happen.Fixing broken software, making good desktop environments, creating Wine or Proton or Pipewire or cross-platform software (LibreOffice, all browsers, Electron), does.\n \nreply",

After being rather confused for a while, I finally stopped reading right around page 141 when I realized that the reason his examples looked awful were because they were.In that section of the book, he takes a Java port of Donald Knuth's PrintPrimes program, and refactors it. But in doing so, he actually breaks it. He moves state out of local variables and parameters and makes them all static fields, and then refactors the code into long-winded methods that specifically perform side effects or operate on those fields (names like isNotMultipleOfAnyPreviousFactor(), isLeastRelevantMultipleOfNextLargerPrimeFactor()). But the simple act of moving state that would otherwise be part of the stack frame into static fields means he has changed the behaviour of the code - it is no longer thread safe! calling it from different threads will have undefined results because all threads will be operating on the static fields. He demonstrably made the code worse!.It invalidated the entire book for me at that point. Here's \"Uncle Bob\" trying to pretend to be some aged, skilled, craftsman hand guiding us young, ignorant whippersnappers into being proper craftsman and not only can't he properly refactor a simple prime number sieve as a demonstration, but he's so blind to awful code that he doesn't even see it in his awful example enough that it gets published in the same book that complained about programmers who don't have \"code-sense\".
