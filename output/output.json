I\u2019m no expert on EMP effects, but multiple-mile-long cable loops underground seem like the kind of thing that would develop large induced currents in the presence of a varying magnetic field.Nonconductive fiber optic cables are entirely immune to these effects.

The tracefs approach has been good enough for me, but the only 100% guaranteed way to see all currently available syscalls would be to read the syscall table from kernel memory and see which syscall handler kernel functions they call (as the syscall name itself is meaningless inside the kernel).\n \nreply",

      "The question was about syscall numbers. The man pages don't show the numbers.The internal syscall numbers are defined in syscall_64.tbl in kernel source and you can parse the (libc-used) syscall numbers from various /usr/include/asm/syscall.h files, but these files don't necessarily contain all the available syscalls in your currently running kernel.You can read your kernel's/platform's currently available syscalls from the relevant /sys/kernel/debug/tracing tracepoint files (I posted a link to my script in another comment here). That way you'll see all currently available system calls and their arguments, but tracefs doesn't show the syscall internal numbers (syscall table slot numbers), but rather the new syscall ID.The internal syscall numbering can change when you switch/build a new kernel and syscalls have different numbers across platforms. Syscall 0 is \"read\" on x86_64, but is \"io_setup\" on aarch64, for example. The new syscall ID aims to provide stable numbering with no conflicts and overlaps across platforms and kernel versions, as I understand.\n \nreply",

Have you considered writing some code that takes a configured + built kernel source tree; finds the intermediate build artifacts pertaining to the code unit that contains the syscall handler; and parses those? And then taking the resulting IR data-structure / AST / whatever, and doing some symbolic interpretation of it \u2014 to enable you to essentially do an xpath-like expression match on \"does something specific with a concrete syscall number that isn't already in the known set for the arch\"? AFAICT you could generate your own syscall table from that, and it would be exhaustive.2. Have you considered dropping a little bit of driver-program code into the kernel source tree, that just \"does syscall handling according to the passed-in paralemeters\" \u2014 i.e. where the artifact built from compiling this file, would be an EFI-app pseudo-unikernel that naively pretends all kernel services were already initialized (they weren't); would do one syscall operation, calling directly into the syscall handler; and then would immediately halt afterward \u2014 and then feeding the resulting \"executable\" to https://github.com/google/AFL ?\n \nreply"

      "I am highly skeptical of LLMs as a mechanism to achieve AGI, but I also find this paper fairly unconvincing, bordering on tautological. I feel similarly about this as to what I've read of Chalmers - I agree with pretty much all of the conclusions, but I don't feel like the text would convince me of those conclusions if I disagreed; it's more like it's showing me ways of explaining or illustrating what I already believed.On embodiment - yes, LLMs do not have corporeal experience. But it's not obvious that this means that they cannot, a priori, have an \"internal\" concept of reality, or that it's impossible to gain such an understanding from text. The argument feels circular: LLMs are similar to a fake \"video game\" world because they aren't real people - therefore, it's wrong to think that they could be real people? And the other half of the argument is that because LLMs can only see text, they're missing out on the wider world of non-textual communication; but then, does that mean that human writing is not \"real\" language? This argument feels especially weak in the face of multi-modal models that are in fact able to \"see\" and \"hear\".The other flavor of argument here is that LLM behavior is empirically non-human - e.g., the argument about not asking for clarification. But that only means that they aren't currently matching humans, not that they couldn't.Basically all of these arguments feel like they fall down to the strongest counterargument I see proposed by LLM-believers, which is that sufficiently advanced mimicry is not only indistinguishable from the real thing, but at the limit in fact is the real thing. If we say that it's impossible to have true language skills without implicitly having a representation of self and environment, and then we see an entity with what appears to be true language skills, we should conclude that that entity must contain within it a representation of self and environment. That argument doesn't rely on any assumptions about the mechanism of representation other than a reliance on physicalism. Looking at it from the other direction, if you assume that all that it means to \"be human\" is encapsulated in the entropy of a human body, then that concept is necessarily describable with finite entropy. Therefore, by extension, there must be some number of parameters and some model architecture that completely encode that entropy. Questions like whether LLMs are the perfect architecture or whether the number of parameters required is a number that can be practically stored on human-manufacturable media are engineering questions, not philosophical ones: finite problems admit finite solutions, full stop.Again, that conclusion feels wrong to me... but if I'm being honest with myself, I can't point to why, other than to point at some form of dualism or spirituality as the escape hatch.\n \nreply",
      ">that sufficiently advanced mimicry is not only indistinguishable from the real thing, but at the limit in fact is the real thing.While sufficiently does a lot of the heavy lifting here, the indistinguishable criteria implicitly means there must be no-way to tell if it is not the real thing.  The belief that it is the real thing comes from the intuition that anything that can be everything a person must be, but have that fundamental essence of being a person.  I don't think people could really conceive an alternative without resorting to prejudice which they could equally apply to machines or people.I take the arguments such as in this paper to be instead making the claim that because X cannot be Y you will never be able to make X indistinguishable from Y.   It is more a prediction of future failure than a judgment on an existing thing.I end up looking at some of these complaints from the point of view of my sometimes profession of Game Developer.   When I show someone a game in development to playtest they will find a bunch of issues. The vast majority of those issues, not only am I already aware of, but I have a much more detailed perspective of what the problem is and how it might be fixed.  I have been seeing the problem, over and over, every day as I work.  The problem persists because there are other things to do before fixing the issue, some of which might render the issue redundant anyway.I feel like a lot of the criticisms of AI are like this they are like the playtesters pointing out issues in the current state where those working on the problems are generally well aware of particular issues and have a variety of solutions in mind that might help.Clear statements of deficiencies in ability are helpful as a guide to measure future success.I'm also in the camp that LLM's cannot be an AGI on its own, on the other hand I do think the architecture might be extended to become one.  There is an easy out for any criticism to say, \"Well, it's not an LLM anymore\".In a way that ends up with a lot of people saying.The current models cannot do the things we know the current models cannot do.Future models will not be able to do those things if they are the same as the current ones.Therefore the things that will be able to do those things will be differentThat is true, but hardly enlightening.\n \nreply",
      "> LLMs do not have corporeal experience. But it's not obvious that this means that they cannot, a priori, have an \"internal\" concept of reality, or that it's impossible to gain such an understanding from text.I would argue it is (obviously) impossible the way the current implementation of models work.How could a system which produces a single next word based upon a likelihood and and a parameter called a \"temperature\" have a conceptual model underpinning it?  Even theoretically?Humans and animals have an obvious conceptual understanding of the world.  Before we \"emit\" a word or a sentence, we have an idea of what we're going to say.  This is obvious when talking to children, who know something and have a hard time saying it.  Clearly, language is not the medium in which they think or develop thoughts, merely an imperfect (and often humorous) expression of it.Not so with LLMs!!  Generative LLMs do not have a prior concept available before they start emitting text.  That the \"temperature\" can chaotically change the output as the tokens proceed just goes to show there is no pre-existing concept to reference.  It looks right, and often is right, but generative systems are basically always hallucinating: they do not have any concepts at all.  That they are \"right\" as often as they are is a testament to the power of curve fitting and compression of basis functions in high dimensionality spaces.  But JPEGs do the same thing, and I don't believe they have a conceptual understanding of pictures.\n \nreply",
      "The argument would be that that conceptual model is encoded in the intermediate-layer parameters of the model, in a different but analogous way to how it's encoded in the graph and chemical structure of your neurons.\n \nreply",
      "I agree that's an argument.  I would contend that argument is obviously false.  If it were true, LLMs could multiply scalar numbers together trivially.  It should be the easiest thing in the world for them.  The network required to do that well is extremely small, the parameter sizes of these models are gigantic, and the textual expression is highly regular: multiplication is the simplest concept imaginable.That they cannot do that basic task implies to me that they have almost no conceptual understanding unless the fit is almost memorizable or the space is highly regular.  That LLMs can't multiply numbers properly isn't surprising if they don't really understand concepts prior to emitting text.  Where they do logical tasks, that can be done with minimal or no understanding, because syllogisms and logical formalisms are highly structured in text arguments.\n \nreply",
      "Multiplication requires O(n^2) complexity with the usual algorithm used by humans, LLMs have a constant amount of computation available and they are not really efficient machines for math evaluation. They can definitely evaluate unseen expressions and you train a neural network to learn how to do sums and multiplications, I have trained models on sums and they are able to do sums never seen during training, the model learns the algorithm just by giving it inputs and outputs.\n \nreply",
      "> generative systems are basically always hallucinating: they do not have any concepts at all. That they are \"right\" as often as they are is a testament to the power of curve fitting and compression of basis functions in high dimensionality spacesIt's refreshing to read someone who \"got it\". Sad that before my upvote the comment was grayed out.Any proponent of conceptual or other wishful/magical thinking shoud come with proofs, since it is the hypothesis that diverge from the definition of a LLM.\n \nreply",
      "It's only because you can essentially put the llms in a simulations that you can have this argument. We can imagine the human brain also in a simulation which we can replay over and over again and adjust various parameters of the physical brain to change the temperature.

      "Full paper: [1].Not much new here. The basic criticism is that LLMs are not embodied; they have no interaction with the real world. The same criticism can be applied to most office work.Useful insight: \"We (humans) are always doing more than one thing.\" This is in the sense of language output having goals for the speaker, not just delivering information. This is related to the problem of LLMs losing the thread of a conversation. Probably the only reasonably new concept in this paper.Standard rant: \"Humans are not brains that exist in a vat...\"\"LLMs ... have nothing at stake.\" Arguable, in that some LLMs are trained using punishment. Which seems to have strong side effects. The undesirable behavior is suppressed, but so is much other behavior. That's rather human-like.\"LLMs Don\u2019t Algospeak\".

Major chatbots are no doubt being iteratively refined on the feedback from users i.e. interaction feedback, RLHF, RLAIF. So ChatGPT could fall within the sort of \"enactive\" perspective on language and definitely goes beyond the issues of static datasets and data completeness.Sidenote: the authors make a mistake when citing Wittgenstein to find similarity between humans and LLMs. Language modelling on a static dataset is mostly not a language game (see Bender and Koller's section on distributional semantics and caveats on learning meaning from \"control codes\")\n \nreply"

Same with Jews in America, and increasingly with Hispanics.Why is it that economic migrants do, after a few generations, become successfully integrated in America, while they tend not to in Europe?I don't think the evidence definitively supports the conclusion that it's down to which group. Europe has a problem with integration that has its roots in the ethnic character of its states (something America does not have), in deep-seated xenophobia that causes social exclusion of immigrant or out-groups, and in the fact that its states' reasons for existence are based on tribal boundaries and wars for territory rather than on achieving broader democratic and economic flourishing by harnessing the capability of the whole population. And thus Europe presents neither a dream of integration nor a path toward integration (as in, \"to become American\"; there is neither an equivalent aspiration nor option \"to become French\"). And then, once again, Europe blames the groups it refuses to accept.\n \nreply",
      "Subtle topic. In France there were waves of italians and spaniards in the early 20th, it went bad for a short while and then became a non issue apparently (being born in the 80s, these groups were never causing trouble in the slightest). Sharing history probably helps too.I also never felt any issue regarding Jewish people but considering this was after ww2 .. nobody would really say a thing either, but personally they never displayed anything noteworthy society wise. another non issueNow it's African, northern African populations being at the forefront of news, but personally i had many more issues with them (and i'm partially brown so the chances of them thinking I'm too different are lower). regularly they displayed very low morals, aggressiveness, sudden high fanaticism toward religious principles they didn't really grasp, worse behavior in school.My mother knew people from Asia (Vietnamese, Cambodians) fleeing from war, with no resources, not speaking french, nothing in common with Europe, they mentioned seeing some racism, yet they too ended up being a non issue. They end up being as the cliche quiet-asian-1st-in-class kid and that's the end of it.It's possible France or other European countries have some underlying, hard to describe, notion of integration. It's less economical and more about mentality ? Maybe except UK, where it's often said that anybody will to work would rapidly integrate. I still can't say.\n \nreply",

      "I recently learned about mathematical maturity: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturityPreviously, I thought certain math topics were \"hard\" (e.g. category theory) while others were supposed to be \"easy\" (e.g. Calc I). I beat myself up for struggling with the \"easy\" topics and believe this precluded me from ever tackling \"hard\" topics.I was thirty-something years old when I finally realized math has a well-documented maturity model, just like emotional maturity or financial maturity. This realization inspired me to go back and take a few math classes that I had previously labeled as \"too hard,\" with the mindset that I was progressing my math maturity.My point is that choosing an \"age-appropriate\" (in terms of math maturity, not actual calendar age) textbook is important. I also find it extremely helpful to chat with people who are more mathematically mature than I am, in the same way it's helpful to seek advice from an older sibling.\n \nreply",
      "This was very much my experience with computer science. When I first studied computer science in middle school at age 13, I could only understand simpler algorithms like quicksort. I simply couldn't grasp dynamic programming. When I studied it again at age 19 (after having learned a couple of more programming languages like C++ and Python and Haskell, as well as taken some classes in mathematical proofs), it became much easier to understand. And then it was around age 22 when I could solve competition-style dynamic programming problems with ease.\n \nreply",

You can learn it at any age and with no almost no prior education. Same with various formal logics.You can't study or use in any way the theory of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds unless you have mastered all of its prerequisites.Certainly the advice of not choosing textbooks you don't understand is spot on, however.

      "> Mathematical maturity has all to do with practice and experience and nothing to do with age.That's OP's point.\"Age-appropriate\" was put in quotes because it was referring to a metaphorical \"mathematical age\" to tie it to the concept of mathematical maturity.And, indeed, certain books require more mathematical maturity to get through than others, even though the prerequisites may be minimal. You'll see this often explicitly described in the preface of textbooks and reviews of those textbooks.They mentioned studying certain books to develop mathematical maturity because that's where the practice and experience happen. Calculus is one such course used as part of this process, as are many courses intended as a first exposure to proofs like linear algebra and discrete math. Some might use the Moore Method with point-set topology.\n \nreply",

This is a skill that needs practice; this was one of the first places I found the equations dense enough that I couldn't just \"swallow them whole\".(The earlier I remember is the quadratic formula, which I first painfully memorized as technical trivia.

Instead of creating a bluetooth connection to the device, the device acts as a host and listens for advertisements w/ specialized data in order to set vibrator power. Not only is this easily hackable (there was a bunch of articles about someone doing exactly that with a flipper zero last year), it's damn near impossible for us to implement cross platform support for, as advertisement creation in BLE is wildly different across platforms, and doesn't even exist on iOS (the company themselves only shipped on android, where buttplug works on win/mac/linux/android/iOS). On top of that, the Lovespouse devices were extremely cheap ($10-30US sometimes), so we had users buying them then asking if we supported them, and all we could say was \"nope\".\n \nreply",

They drop straight under their parent tree or get trapped in the tangled roots of the surrounding mangrove forest and take root a few feet or miles away. But long distance dispersal across oceans and seas is still important, said Van der Stocken. If mangroves need to expand their range because of unsuitable environmental conditions from climate change or weather events, as in Texas, being able to spread their genetic material long distances on ocean currents becomes important, he said.Across the globe in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific mangrove populations, including those along the Gulf of Mexico, reduced water density was less apparent in the study models. However, the model found these regions might develop saltier water than the Western Pacific. Even if propagules travel the same distance, increased salinity might affect their survival, which will have implications for the dispersal dynamics of mangroves in those regions.\n \nreply",

      "A big cultural outcome of Netware was the shear volume of highly compatible Novell network cards that flooded the market. Novell charged a fortune for Netware licenses but their hardware was cheap. Especially when corporations upgraded and there was suddenly 1000 NE2000 cards for $2 each at the local swap meet.Imho the entire LAN culture of the 90's was enabled by being able to join in for the cost of a coffee and people would often have a few spare cards for those that showed up to the party without one.\n \nreply",

      "MCNE/MCSE here from the mid-90\u2019s, agree it was obvious that Netware would likely fade.  Windows NT 3.51 (even though it wasn\u2019t as good at the time), was more user friendly and had the Windows interface, compatibility, etc etc\nHowever, it NT wasn\u2019t remotely as stable as Netware at that time either. \nThen we got to watch as Novell slowly went insane competing and buying WordPerfect and doing all sorts of other crazy moves.\nI still wish that Novell had taken all of its money and bought VMware when they were just working on GSX/ESX (now vSphere). This would have changed the trajectory of both Novell and the market.\n \nreply",
      "In addition, from what I vaguely recall, one of the big selling point of NT LAN Manager was the ability to deploy network server applications on the server.Novell responded with Netware Loadable Modules, but they weren\u2019t as versatile and needed specialised knowledge/tools.\n \nreply",
      "Yep, Netware ran entirely in Ring 0. In linux terminology it was a kernel with no user space, and NLMs were kernel modules. Very fast for file serving, but any application could crash the system. Stability was largely a result of lots of updates. NT had userspace, protected memory, etc, and a GUI for setting up TCP/IP.\n \nreply",
      "Netware existed and thrived before NT LAN Manager. NT LAN Manager seemed like the one MS product that couldn't make inroads against established competition. It simply wasn't as good as Netware.The way I remember it NLMs were pretty stable. Anything on Windows was not stable, userspace or otherwise. Netware's TUI was just as good as NT's GUI for what it needed to do. It wasn't a liability. Netware's superior directory service was more important.Netware's demise was the transition from IPX to TCIP/IP and the explosion of the WWW. And from my perspective it wasn't really NT that knocked Netware down. It was Linux and Solaris. Novell kinda saw that coming and tried to figure out a future with SuSE. They just never got the combination of their directory server with Linux right in time. Microsoft stumbled around for some years, but they got their directory services figured out before Novell got their OS story straight in the new world.\n \nreply",

      "> NT had userspace, protected memory, etc, and a GUI for setting up TCP/IP.That's because Microsoft hired Dave Cutler who previously worked on VMS and knew what he was doing. Microsoft even had their own Unix, but didn't know what to do with it.\n \nreply",

Even so, it contains much more oxygen in silicates, than carbon.The core of Mercury is made of iron alloy, like all planet cores. This study supposes that the liquid core has been saturated in carbon. In this case, when the core has solidified, it must have expelled a part of the dissolved carbon at the surface of the core. Due to the high pressure, the expelled carbon must have formed diamond, instead of forming graphite, as it happens at the solidification of smelted pig iron (after a sufficient time, so that any metastable carbides will decompose).\n \nreply",

      "I think the understanding that they are not rare and that the price is entirely an extortionary corporate fiction to collect huge profits will influence one's desire to pay the high price.Like if you buy a gold ring, I suspect its cost will be pretty related to the base price of commodity gold, the labor involved in creating it, and a reasonable markup for the company to survive.
