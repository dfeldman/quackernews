      "One distressing trend I've noticed becoming ubiquitous on HN is that any writing that is confronting to a consensus worldview becomes flooded with highly upvoted comments that are, in essence, excuses for why it's not necessary in this instance to re-examine your priors.He's making low value content/the culture of the company is horrible/he's a fraud/it's more luck than skill. The actual critiques are personalized to the content and, to one extent or another, valid, but the social purpose of the critiques is universal which is that I felt uncomfortable that reading this might mean I have to re-evaluate my worldview and I'm going to dive into the comment section and upvote all the people telling me actually, I don't have to do that.I actually spent over an hour writing 750+ words of my takeaways reading this document and shared it privately with a few founder friends of mine and I briefly considered also posting to share with the community but I took a look at the comments and took a look at what I wrote and decided I didn't have the energy to face the endless onslaught of nitpicks and misunderstandings that are driven, at the end of the day, not by a genuine intellectual desire to reach an understanding, but by the need to prove emotionally that others are not taking this seriously so I don't have to either.All I can do is be vague and say I think this was an enormously valuable piece of writing that is worth engaging seriously for what it is as it might change your worldview in several important ways.But also my larger meta-point is that there's a now near ubiquitous \"sour grapes\" attitude that's pervaded HN that makes it an extremely unpleasant place to hold a conversation and people reading should be aware of this systematic bias when reading comments here.\n \nreply",
      "Have you considered that the sour grapes attitude actually comes from an understanding of the world, and how everything has been turned only into profit maximization?And that the nitpicking is merely a failure to express that understanding of the world, especially since it seems like pro-status quo commenters don't care to learn more?I think I'm one of the sour grapes commenters often, and I've very often tried to have patience to explain in depth where my opinions come from. My greatest frustration is trying to describe for instance why someone like Mr Beast is antisocial (as I actually did a long time ago), and then being met by responses like \"he's obviously doing something right to get all those views and he's promoting altruism\", responses that obviously never bother to understand what my point was.If think if we really are supposed to improve the quality of discussions, asking more questions should be common when we fundamentally disagree so much. On fundamental disagreements, either the other party is stupid/naive/uninformed or they have fundamentally different principles that we might not understand, and without which a response is just flaming.Later edit: I actually think the document by Mr Beast is exceptionally well written, and most startups could apply the main lessons from it. I still think his output is extremely antisocial.\n \nreply",
      "The \"sour grapes\" attitude has IMO really started crowding out other content. Pretty much any popular content here just has a flood of social signaling content all about how morally wrong, bad, evil, etc the content is. And if you don't want to pile on the commentary, which is all pretty much the same thing regurgitated in different ways, then your content just kinda languishes at the bottom of the page. I don't really know why this kind of content is so engaging but I guess it is. Kinda like a sports match where everyone just shouts at how bad the other team is or something.EDIT: My pet theory is that it has to do with the general aging of the users here. There's a kind of well-to-do, Western, mid-40s (usually male) social opinion I see upvoted a lot here that I feel like hits the sweet spot of the folks who still read this site regularly. But it's just a theory really.\n \nreply",
      "It would help if half the content on this site wasn't highly unethical lol.  It feels like the tech industry is having a moment where a lot of us are looking critically at the work we're doing and the effects it has on the society we live in. Sometimes that's not fun but it is important. Sorry if that checks the vibes too much for you.\n \nreply",
      "Okay so now what effect are you having by making this ethical criticism? Are you changing the ethical outlook of the industry? Are you making a positive ethical impact?>  It feels like the tech industry is having a moment where a lot of us are looking critically at the work we're doing and the effects it has on the society we live in.I think you grossly overestimate HN's prominence in the tech industry.

Sorry if that checks the vibes too much for you.No I just do what everyone else does which is talk about tech elsewhere. I spent a lot of time over the last 15 years here so I'm sad that the place has changed, but at the end of the day I have several alternatives.Moreover there's plenty of problems in the world out there. A few wars in progress, a genocide or two. My relatives spent the last few weeks in hiding because a government failed. MrBeast's engagement practices are probably the very lowest of my worries. If only HN comments could change the world...\n \nreply",
      "Hey everyone, let's take a leaf out of this guys book and only mention ethical concerns if he deems them worthy - like wars for example. Anything lower than that isn't worth mentioning because it kills the vibes. Wonder if he'll see this as he doesn't use this site anymore and talks with the intellectual founder-boys elsewhere...\n \nreply",
      "> I think you grossly overestimate HN's prominence in the tech industry. It was where all the founders hung out 15 years ago. It's now just a place where IT workers talk.You either missed the point of the GP comment, or you think that it's entirely pointless to discuss important issues unless it's with people of prominence. Depressing if it's the latter, but given how you started your post, I'm leaning toward that interpretation.  That's some kind of fucked up elitism right there.\n \nreply",
      "Founders aren\u2019t here, but all the workers are, and they\u2019re overestimating HN\u2019s prominence? Or are you overvaluing the position of founder. Like you\u2019re on some Randian philosophy shit, or something.\n \nreply",

Many of them have had an actively positive one.> I think you grossly overestimate HN's prominence in the tech industry.It's a good thing I wasn't talking solely about hackernews then.\n \nreply",
      "I really enjoyed the book \"The Smartest Guys in the Room\" about the Enron scandal for two reasons. The first and more obvious was that it was a deeper look into the systemic issues that led to the failures, which meant it was less \"they did a fraud\" and more about the way culture evolves at a company to the point that they did it.Perhaps more importantly though, was my takeaway that it mostly wasn't fraud, it was truly innovative accounting that with hindsight was the wrong idea, but if the world worked out just a bit differently, could have led to them winning the market and taking the financial world in a new direction. It's not obvious to me that the fraud timeline is the only one or even the most likely one, we'll never know.\"History is written by the victors\" is what comes to mind here. Or in another way, it's survivorship bias. I haven't read the Mr Beast document yet but I can imagine what's in it because my previous company had similar material (although likely far less controversial), and I'd bet many commenters here have similar culture documents, handbooks, mission statements, and so on, which when read out of context or through the lens of a future scandal could appear far more incriminating than otherwise.We need to get better at distilling what it is in material like this that is a contributor to the success/failure/scandal, and what... just is... doesn't have an impact, or could have been another way. We need to be better at actually learning from these things in a nuanced way.\n \nreply"

      "It all feels like theatre. Been working in many companies in \u201cwar mode\u201d and they all think that in order to become profitable (none of them were) you need to push the most \u201cimportant\u201d features out of the door asap, otherwise your competitors will eat you alive.It\u2019s a lie. Executives and VPs and all those folks that earn 5x what a normal engineer earns, don\u2019t really care about the company they work for. All they care about is to keep receiving the big pay checks until the ship sinks. Obviously you cannot just mandate \u201cnormal mode\u201d, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t look as if everyone is doing their best to keep the company afloat.I hope in 10 years or so, we\u2019ll see \u201cwartime software engineering\u201d with the same eyes we see today Agile and Scrum masters: snake oil.\n \nreply",

People can last quite a long time at such places with a little luck.\n \nreply",

In a small company, particularly one with engaged and transparent leadership, everyone knows what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t and about how long the latter can be endured. At a large company the vast majority of jobs are susceptible to the whims and whispers of a few (who likely aren\u2019t engaged and feel they can\u2019t be transparent).Obviously this is just one person\u2019s opinion.\n \nreply",
      "I'll push back in defense of Scrum, but it probably bears a little explanation because my conceptualization of that framework is very likely a lot different from yours. (As something of a bonus: I'll bring in the military given the whole \"wartime\" trope.)In particular, Scrum is only there to establish rituals that enable empiricism in decision making. A sprint is a reporting period to keep the team from spending too much time in the weeds. A standup is there to keep the team working together. The andon cord (which is often missing I find) is there when the facts have changed so utterly profoundly that everyone needs to regroup.Anyone who's been through RTC (\"boot camp\"), and even some who haven't but have lived vicariously through others, understand that being constantly yelled at by RDCs (\"drill instructors\") on how you make your racks and fold your clothes is all about building certain habits and only tenuously related to what you'll be doing after A-school. It all has more to do with building trust that the rest of the folks in your ship will help carry you when the going gets tough. Scrum, at its core, is kinda like that.I really dislike the term \"Scrum Master.\" They're a team captain. The more military-minded might be keener to use \"gunnery sergeant\" or \"chief petty officer:\" they're just the most senior person in the rating group^W^W^W^Won the team. (Though, I'd probably take more inspiration from the Marines than the Navy here: a culture of servant leadership seems to bring out the best in people.)The most popular implementations of Scrum tend to come with a ridiculous amount of meeting and tool baggage, and it's so unnecessary.Use Excel. Hold your standups at the close of the day so people can go home. Write your product backlog items in delivery order so that sprint planning is less about sitting in one room playing poker and more about just getting valuable shit done.That said, what isn't unnecessary, however, is kneecapping command a little: the engineering officer of the watch has comparatively little understanding of the actual operation of the machine. They just know that they want operational excellence. However, that excellence also sometimes comes with the watch supervisor\u2014a subordinate\u2014publicly calling out mistakes that the watch officer makes.\n \nreply",
      "> I really dislike the term \"Scrum Master.\" They're a team captain.Originally that term was supposed to be a temporary role that someone (rotated each time) would take on during a scrum meeting, and referred to them being charged with keeping the meeting on track.\n \nreply",
      "It was! I've, however, gotten way more use out of saddling whoever is most senior with the role of making sure the team as a whole is on track. This way, it's a little more familiar with the way Western management hierarchy operates without turning it too much on its head. It's something of a leadership billet without removing the ability to be technical, which is important for a lot of folks.It tends to work pretty well in an environment that both lacks a bug tracker (so that individual people aren't assigned things) and has a culture of pairing or mobbing.\n \nreply"

These works describe \"wartime\" as an existential fight for survival that requires a different type of leadership compared to the relative prosperity of \"peacetime\".

(every state has its own trademark office, in addition to the federal pto.)  there is no trademark equivalent of the berne convention or the pctso the idea of a paraguayan company, in paraguay, infringing a us trademark, is legal hogwash. mickey is a disney trademark in paraguay only to the extent that the paraguayan government decides to grant it to them, a decision that should be made on the basis of, among other things, existing uses by other companies. this is a fundamental and intentional feature of trademark law in every jurisdiction i am familiar with, not a bug\u2014 \u2042 \u2014to a significant extent trademark law is arbitrary in the same way traffic laws are.  there's no objective reason, nothing justifiable according to some kind of natural law, that says you should drive on the left side of the road, or stop when the traffic light turns red rather than green.  if everyone else is driving on the right side of the road, or stopping when their light turns green and your light turns red, that would be a better thing to do.  the law in these cases is merely establishing a schelling point that allows a large society to coordinate their actions through more or less random but well-known decisionsthe justification for trademark law is to protect consumers from inferior goods bearing the name of a reputable maker, but made by someone else.  for this purpose it reserves particular names and logos for the exclusive use of particular makers.  which particular names and logos are reserved for which particular makers is essentially arbitrary; what matters is that it be relatively consistent over time, so that consumers aren't buying good mickey-branded bread from the paraguayan mickey company one day and adulterated mickey-branded bread licensed by disney the next(you can argue that to some extent modern trademark law is failing at this job, due to notorious cases of perfectly legal line extension fraud\u2014such as exploding tempered-soda-lime-glass pyrex, saran-free saran wrap, pseudoephedrine-free sudafed, kaopectate without kaolin or pectin, and generic t-shirts bearing a designer's licensed brand\u2014or the widespread phenomenon of private equity firms buying a quality brand and replacing its products with inferior replacements.  but that's the justification for its existence)\n \nreply",

It's not even worthwhile for comparing YoY as your lifestyle, the economy, etc change so much.I ended up adding per-transaction opt-out roll up functionality for this reason, effectively squashing transactions into monthly and yearly budget summary transaction.

My wife doesn't appreciate being hassled for the statement from her work HSA every month, so we just occasionally sit down and catch everything up, maybe twice a year.Overall I find the automation means it's vastly less work than when I used gnucash, and the flexibility in expense structures and ease of assigning things mean I have much better budget data than when I used mint.com.\n \nreply",

      "A while back, I had the need to remotely monitor a house while it was under renovation. A few friends of mine recommended a particular brand of highly-advertised security system. It was not cheap. As I was setting it up, I found out that most of the features that I wanted required broadband internet. This was not disclosed in ANY of the marketing materials. This house didn't have Internet and I wasn't going to purchase it because it would have been $60 minimum on top of the $40 or so the security system was going to cost.What I did instead: I bought a Raspberry Pi camera, hooked it up to a RPi Zero 2W that I already had, bought an LTE hotspot and a $5/mo prepaid SIM from T-Mobile. On the software side, I used imgcomp (https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/imgcomp) to take a photo every second and save it to a RAM disk. If the two pictures differed (modulo noise), the Pi would upload the changed picture to a directory on my VPS, which would then trigger a notification to my phone via Gotify containing the link to the picture.It was all very Rube Goldbergian but it worked quite flawlessly for a couple of years.\n \nreply",

Puzzle 66 contained 66 unknown bits and had 6.6 BTC deposited into it by the initial puzzle creator. The private key was 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002832ed74f2b5e35ee or 256 bits with mostly zeroes but 66 random ones.The next Bitcoin puzzle, #67, has 67 unknown bits, and contains 6.7 BTC up for grabs: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1BY8GQbnue...The previous puzzle by order of difficulty was #64 (not #65, because see below) and was solved on 9/9/2022, so about 2 years ago. In other words, it took about 2 years of compute time to run the 2^66 bruteforcing task.Puzzles that are multiple of 5 (#65 or #70) are special: they have twice more entropy. So that private key #65 doesn't have 65-bit of entropy but 130-bit of entropy. And the creator of the puzzle intentionally published their public key on the blockchain. When you know the public key, brutetforcing the n-bit private key only requires 2^(n/2) work. So puzzle #65 with a 130-bit key actually require bruteforcing up to only 2^65 keys.\n \nreply",

      "The tying together of physical locations and audio book contents, or philosophical musings on a drive, are examples of those higher-order representations [0] the author references.There is a sibling thread further down regarding the Buddhist take on phenomenology as a linear stream of discrete events. With sufficient practice it becomes possible to observe an individual sense datum - an instant of time in which I am hearing a bird chirp, followed by an instant of time in which I feel an itch on my head, followed by an instant of time in which I experience the thought of \"what's for dinner,\" and so on. This is stepping down a \"layer of abstraction,\" beneath higher-order representations of unity, to observe the lower-level discrete phenomena as they exist prior to the \"post-processing\" applied by our minds. After this post-processing step, the individual discrete points of \"hearing,\" \"itching,\" \"thinking\" are melded into the (ultimately illusory) unified experience of, for example, \"sitting down for meditation next to an open window.\" This latter, post-processed view is ultimately an oversimplification, and investigation into the nature of such higher-order representations reveals their constituent parts.It's this act of reflection and retrospection that unifies this stream of discrete sensory events into a cohesive whole and weaves the illusion of continuity out of a series of discrete points. Our phenomenological experience is like a pointillist painting viewed from afar; the astute observer with sufficient concentration to examine the painting more closely however can see that it is in fact a constellation of dots which our minds smear together into the higher-order (and illusory) representation of a continuous whole.I recommend Daniel Ingram's \"Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha\" for a western, secularized take on this aspect of (Vipassana) Buddhism.[0] https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-higher/\n \nreply",

      "If you know that a source of randomness contains entropy (unpredictable bits) but you don't know how much (ex. digital camera unless heavily processed will contain random sensor noise in the output) the safest thing to do is pipe it into a cryptographic construct such as a hash or a sponge.Once you believe you piped enough you use the state of the cryptographic primitive as the seed for further random bit generation. The Linux kernel uses a sponge (to accumulate), hash function (to consolidate) and a stream cipher (to output) to 'convert' events with some degree of randomness into 'infinite' safe cryptographically secure random bits.To acquire some intuition about this you can imagine taking a raw 1MP photo with a camera sensor and then feeding the lossless file to sha256sum. You acquire a 256 bit string and the sensor noise in the photo will be sufficient to secure the result. An attacker would need to model all the degrees of freedom in taking photos in the world and sensor noise production to build a simulator for your camera and start bruteforcing your sha256 result which will almost certainly (sensor might be compromised or not really be raw) contain far more degrees of freedom than 256 bits.\n \nreply",

Recently, while reading Turing award winner Avi Widgerson's excellent book Mathematics and Computation, I learned that this is a simple case of a more general problem of deterministic randomness extraction: given a stream of random input bits, which are potentially biased and correlated, create a stream of output bits which are uniform random, ie. a series of fair coin tosses. The output bit stream, like in the Von Neumann case, is allowed to have a lower bitrate, ie. we don't always emit output bits on input.Using the language of entropy, the input bit stream has non-zero, but less than 1-bit of entropy per bit: $ 0 < H_{input} < 1 $. We want to create an output bit stream which does have 1-bit of entropy pe"
