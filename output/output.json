    "first_paragraph": "LZW is a way of compressing data that takes advantage of repetition of\nstrings in the data. Since raster data usually contains a lot of this\nrepetition, LZW is a good way of compressing and decompressing it.\n     For the moment, lets consider normal LZW encoding and decoding. GIF's\nvariation on the concept is just an extension from there.\n   \n\n  LZW manipulates three objects in both compression and decompression: the\ncharstream, the codestream, and the string table. In compression, the\ncharstream is the input and the codestream is the output. In decompression,\nthe codestream is the input and the charstream is the output. The string table\nis a product of both compression and decompression, but is never passed from\none to the other.\n\nCompression\n\n     The first thing we do in LZW compression is initialize our string table.\nTo do this, we need to choose a code size (how many bits) and know how many\nvalues our characters can possibly take. Let's say our code size is 12 bits,\nmeaning we can"

Art director Ole Tillmann tells writer Alix-Rose Cowie how the team brought the game\u2019s universe to life, and about the myriad of influences that inspired it."
