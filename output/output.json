      "You have to keep in mind Microsoft is planning on spending almost 100B in datacenter capex this year and they're not alone. This is basically OpenAI matching the major cloud provider's spending.This could also be (at least partly) a reaction to Microsoft threatening to pull OpenAI's cloud credits last year.  OpenAI wants to maintain independence and with compute accounting for 25\u201350% of their expenses (currently) [2], this strategy may actually be prudent.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/03/microsoft-expects-to-spend-8...[2] https://youtu.be/7EH0VjM3dTk?si=hZe0Og6BjqLxbVav&t=1077\n \nreply",
      "Microsoft has lots of revenue streams tied to that capex outlay. Does OpenAI have similar revenue numbers to Microsoft?\n \nreply",
      "OpenAI has a very healthy revenue stream in the form of other companies throwing money at them.But to answer your question, no they aren\u2019t even profitable by themselves.\n \nreply",
      "> they aren\u2019t even profitableDepends on your definition of profitability, They are not recovering R&D and training costs, but they (and MS) are recouping inference costs from user subscription and API revenue with a healthy operating margin.Today they will not survive if they stop investing in R&D, but they do have to slow down at some point. It looks like they and other big players are betting on a moat they hope to build with the $100B DCs and ASICs that open weight models or others cannot compete with.This will be either because training will be too expensive (few entities have the budget for $10B+ on training and no need to monetize it) and even those kind of models where available may be impossible to run inference with off the shelf GPUs, i.e. these models can only run on ASICS, which only large players will have access to[1].In this scenario corporations will have to pay them the money for the best models, when that happens OpenAI can slow down R&D and become profitable with capex considered.[1] This is natural progression in a compute bottle-necked sector, we saw a similar evolution from CPU to ASICS and GPU in the crypto few years ago. It is slightly distorted comparison due to the switch from PoW to PoS and intentional design for GPU for some coins, even then you needed DC scale operations in a cheap power location to be profitable.\n \nreply",
      "They will have an endless wave of commoditization chasing behind them. NVIDIA will continue to market chips to anyone who will buy... Well anyone who is allowed to buy, considering the recent export restrictions. On that note, if OpenAI is in bed with the US government with this to some degree, I would expect tariffs, expert restrictions, and all of that to continue to conveniently align with their business objectives.If the frontier models generate huge revenue from big government and intelligence and corporate contracts, then I can see a dynamo kicking off with the business model. The missing link is probably that there need to be continual breakthroughs that massively increase the power of AI rather than it tapering off with diminishing returns for bigger training/inference capital outlay. Obviously, openAI is leveraging against that view as well.Maybe the most important part is that all of these huge names are involved in the project to some degree. Well, they're all cross-linked in the entire AI enterprise, really, like OpenAI Microsoft, so once all the players give preference to each other, it sort of creates a moat in and of itself, unless foreign sovereign wealth funds start spinning up massive stargate initiatives as well.We'll see. Europe has been behind the ball in tech developments like this historically, and China, although this might be a bit of a stretch to claim, does seem to be held back by their need for control and censorship when it comes to what these models can do. They want them to be focused tools that help society, but the American companies want much more, and they want power in their own hands and power in their user's hands. So much like the first round where American big tech took over the world, maybe it's prime to happen again as the AI industry continues to scale.\n \nreply",

      "So if you send a picture to a Signal user, it's retrieved via cloudflare, and cached in a data center near that user; now you can look up the cache status and find the data center used. I'd say \"deanonymization\" is stretching it, unless the user is in the middle of nowhere (no other users near the data center). But interesting writeup anyway.\n \nreply",
      "\"Near a user\" is also a big assumption.  I'm ~200 miles to ORD and ~500 to IAD, but my ISP's peering & upstream arrangements mean Cloudflare serves my traffic 700 miles from DFW.But, at the same time: Cloudflare isn't going to serve me a cache from Seattle, Manchester, or Tokyo.  Pinning down an unknown Signal user to even a rough geographic location is an important bit of metadata that could combine to unmask an individual.  Neat attack!\n \nreply",
      "It's also quite insidious as you don't need to control anything on any server to get this information; as long as you can get your target to load a unique URL never before loaded by anyone else, you can simply later poll it with an unauthenticated HTTP GET from different locations, and find which one reports a Cloudflare HIT (or, even if they hid that information, finding the one that returns with lower latency).If you're allowing user uploaded content, and you use Cloudflare as a CDN, you could mitigate and provide your users with plausible deniability by prefetching each uploaded URL from random data centers. But, of course, that's going to make your Cloudflare bill that much more expensive.Cloudflare could allow security-sensitive clients to hide the cache-hit header and add randomized latency upon a cache hit, but the latter protection would also be expensive in how many connections must be kept alive longer than they otherwise would. Don't do anything on a personal device or account if you want your datacenter to be hidden!\n \nreply",
      "Pre-fetching also becomes an issue for apps that are meant to be e2e encrypted, since it requires the server to download (read) every attachment. But if the app is already caching the attachment then they\u2019re effectively reading it anyway.(EDIT: Apparently signal e2e encrypts images prior to upload, so pre-fetching the encrypted blob from one or multiple servers would in fact be a mitigation of this attack.)I do wonder if Telegram is as invulnerable as the author assumes. They might not be using Cloudflare for caching, or even HTTP, but the basic elements of this attack might still work. You\u2019d just need to modify the \u201cteleport\u201d aspect of it.\n \nreply",
      "Telegram doesn't use local CDNs for caching. All users are associated with one of about five telegram DCs, and upload files to their local DC. If a file was uploaded by a user on another DC, users connect to it temporarily to download the file.The DC that a user is associated with is exposed by the API - you don't need to get them to upload a file to discover it - but it's so broad that it's not much of a deanonymizing signal.

The problem is that these images load without the user's interaction and the person sending it gets to choose if it's cloudflare or not.

      "The person receiving it chooses to download images or whatever automatically though.I dunno, I'd still say the problem is at least 50% cloudflare. Why should they make which datacenters have a resource cached be obvious public knowledge? I do agree though, one could still end up inferring this information noisily by sending an attachment, waiting a while, and then somehow querying a lot of DCs and trying to infer times to see if it's cached or not.Personally, I've never been a fan about so many things like URLs being so public. I get the benefits of things like CDNs and what not and the odds of guessing a snowflake value and what not, but still...all attachments in Discord are public. If you have a URL, you have the attachment. And they're not the only ones with this kind of access model.\n \nreply",

      "Reminds me of the time I turned myself into a Van de Graff generator at work.I was a theater projectionist, back when you had 20 minute reels you had to constantly change, while babysitting two high-voltage, water-cooled, carbon arc projectors. Sometimes the film would break and you\u2019d have to splice it. So when the theater got a print in, you had to count and log the number of splices for each reel, then the next theater would do the same and retire the print when it got too spliced up (plus, sometimes if it was the last night of a run, some lazy projectionists would splice it in place with masking tape and then you\u2019d have to fix it). Sometimes you had to splice in new trailers or remove inappropriate ones as well.Anyway, you counted splices by rapidly winding through the reel with a benchtop motor with a speed control belted to a takeup reel while the source spun freely. Then, while letting the film slide between your fingers, counting each \u201cbump\u201d you felt as it wound through. I was told to ground myself by touching the metal switch plate of the speed control knob with my other hand. One night I forgot and let go until my hair started rising. I\u2019d gone through most of the reel at a very high speed and acquired its charge.I reached for the switch plate and shot an 8-10\u201d arcing discharge between the plate and my fingers.Lesson learned, I held the switch plate from then on.\n \nreply",

Here's the config, in case folks are looking for an example: https://github.com/kcctl/kcctl/blob/main/pom.xml#L430-L530. Releases are triggered by running a parameterized workflow (taking the version to be released) on GitHub Actions.A big shout-out to Andres Almiray, the maintainer of JReleaser, who has always been super-fast to answer any questions and help to sort out issues when I ran into them.\n \nreply",

Add on to that if you using something that includes a binary (like, say, SQLite, much less JavaFX which I work with).The release burden is, well, frankly, daunting for a small project.My honest thinking for my next project release is simply to tell folks to install the JDK, download the source code, and have them run:  ./mvnw javafx:run.\n\n(Or they can run go.sh/go.bat which essentially does the same thing.)That'll download all of the stuff it needs including the Maven runtime and all of the libraries, as appropriate, build the project, and run it. It's Fast Enough (maybe it's awful on a small RPi, I dunno).When I get more than 5 downloads, folks can vote as to which installer to work on.Creating the executables was quite the black hole. I didn't create one for Linux because I honestly didn't know what packaging scheme to use.In theory, the CI infrastructure on GitHub will let you build on different platforms, yet another black hole of time to sink into.So, yea, at least initially, I think the maven wrapper will be my \"release model\".

Double-clicking a JAR file (or running \"java -jar ...\") tends to be easier than debugging Mac / Windows quirks with Docker.Presumably the major issue in distributing JavaFX applications (or most Java 9+ applications in general) is dealing with jlink.

Maven will \"download the right thing\" and not \"burden\" folks with copies of libraries they don't need.

      "Has anyone implemented this end-to-end? This seems production ready for smaller shops where it's feasible for developers to sign artifacts individually. For a system where you'd want CI to publish artifacts, and then use the k8s policy controller to only run verified artifacts, it seems incomplete.It appears the reason to include this system in a toolchain would be to meet compliance requirements, but even the GCP, AWS, and Azure implementations of artifact signing & verification are in beta.\n \nreply",
      "End-to-end it would require something like a web-of-trust or similar. There is little benefit in knowing that your package was definitely built by GitHub Actions definitely from the code that definitely came from the fingers of the random guy who maintains that particular tool.Unless you have some trust relationship with the author, or with someone that audited the code, the whole cryptographically-authenticated chain hangs from nothing.Tools like Crev did a lot of work in that area but it never really took off, people don't want to think about trust: https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev\n \nreply",

      "This is really cool - it's a relatively well known idea, but it's great to see it get refined and better understood. It's amazing how sparse the brain is; a single neuron can trigger a profound change in contextual relations, and play a critical role in how things get interpreted, remembered, predicted, or otherwise processed.That single cell will have up to 10,000 features, and those features are implicitly processed; they're only activated if the semantic relevance of a particular feature surpasses some threshold of contribution to whatever it is you're thinking at a given moment. Each of those features is binary, either off or on at a given time t in processing. Compare this to artificial neural networks, where a particular notion or concept or idea is an embedding; if you had 10,000 features, each of those is activated and processed every pass. Attention and gating and routing and MoE get into sparsity and start moving artificial networks in the right direction, but they're still enormously clunky and inefficient compared to bio brains.Implicit sparse distributed representation is how the brain can get to ~2% sparse activations, with rapid, precise, and deep learning of features in realtime, where learning one new thing can recontextualize huge swathes of knowledge.These neurons also allow feats of memory, like learning the order of 10 decks of cards in 5 minutes, or reciting 1 million digits of pi, or cabbies learning \"The Knowledge\" and learning every street, road, sidwalk, alley, bridge, and other feature in London, able to traverse the terrain in their mind. It's wonderful that this knowledge is available to us, that the workings of our minds are becoming unveiled.\n \nreply",

      "The authors of the second piece specifically said this was not the same thing: the fact that they weakly fire for loosely-associated concepts is very different from (and ultimately shallower than) concept neurons:  Looking to neuroscience, they might sound like \u201cgrandmother neurons,\u201d but their associative nature distinguishes them from how many neuroscientists interpret that term. The term \u201cconcept neurons\u201d has sometimes been used to describe biological neurons with similar properties, but this framing might encourage people to overinterpret these artificial neurons. Instead, the authors generally think of these neurons as being something like the visual version of a topic feature, activating for features we might expect to be similar in a word embedding.\n\nThe \"turtle+PhD\" artificial neuron is a good example of this distinction: it is just pulling together loosely-related concepts of turtles and academia into one loose neuron, without actually being a coherent concept.\n \nreply",

Some software ran inside workflows will do heavy R/W on C: drive, but it's better to move anything that will be written to disk, e.g. caches, to D: if possible.

As a consequence, their performance tanked 4x and stayed there.We're also seeing massive performance regressions for apps that have many small files, such as SQL Server Analysis Services. Basic operations such as backup, restore, or sync are 10x slower with no recourse.Similarly, the IntelliJ IDEs have a feature to disable A/V scanning on your source code folders for performance.
