      "Temporal is great. I've been using it for a while in production using a polyfill [1], and it solves all issues I've encountered with the old Date() API (which is a lot).It clearly takes inspiration from other high-quality time libraries such as chrono in Rust and Joda Time in Java and combines them into a nice API that's pretty comfortable to use.Yes, it is a bit more complex to handle since it separates time into naive time, instant and zoned time. But by experience, developers only confront complexity when they are forced to, and time _is_ complex.If you want to do the operation \"add one day to this timestamp\", you _must_ decide whether that timestamp is local to a specific timezone and which one. Otherwise you'll get a bug twice per year due to DST, or when the user switches time zones, or when you deploy on a server with a different timezone.It even solves the serialization issue of the difference between a \"fixed-offset\" timestamp (e.g. 2025-01-01T00:00+02:00) and one in a specific timezone (e.g. Europe/Paris).[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/temporal-polyfill\n \nreply",
      "> It clearly takes inspiration from other high-quality time libraries such as chrono in RustYou might be interested in Jiff (a crate for Rust), which is inspired by Temporal. And here is a comparison I did with other datetime crates (including `chrono`): https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/_documentation/comparison/i...I actually don't think Temporal takes a ton of inspiration from the `chrono` crate personally. I think it's definitely more from Joda (as you mentioned) or `java.time` these days, and some of the other Javascript datetime libraries that have cropped up over the years (thinking about date-fns and Moment.js).\n \nreply",
      "> Otherwise you'll get a bug twice per year due to DSTThose of us of a certain age learned long ago never to schedule cron (etc.) jobs in a production environment between 01:00 and 03:00 local time.\n \nreply",
      "A long while ago my friend and I released a Safari extension that shows a few clocks in the timezones that you choose. I can't recall the details, but we had an off by 1 error on a few zones during DST.I ended up fixing it by hand changing the time, releasing a version every 6 months for years, otherwise we would get mails about it from the few users using it.I think I could automate this or otherwise solve the issue, but it always felt nice to move the clocks of a few hundred people.\n \nreply",
      "Are your production servers configured in something other than UTC, or is there a factor here I'm missing? I've never really seen a good reason for a live server not to be Z'd out\n \nreply",
      "That won't save you everywhere, Greenland falls back at midnight (12 AM Sunday to 11 PM Saturday) in order to synchronize their DST change with Europehttps://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/greenland/nuuk\n \nreply",
      "> chrono in Rust and Joda Time in JavaThose are from different time epochs, by the time Rust 1.0 was released, Java already had this approach implemented in standard library via java.time and didn't need any 3rd party libraries for this.\n \nreply",
      "> It even solves the serialization issue of the difference between a \"fixed-offset\" timestamp (e.g. 2025-01-01T00:00+02:00) and one in a specific timezone (e.g. Europe/Paris).Could you elaborate on that? What is the issue?\n \nreply",
      "+02:00 is not political. It's an offset from UTC and will be the same offset in the past and future.Europe/Paris is political. It defines that offsets change at certain times of the year, but that could change tomorrow, or the political boundary that the timezone applies to could split such that the person or entity needing a time in their \"local\" timezone finds another one needs to be picked (see various US states/counties applying/disapplying daylight savings).It's impossible to be 100% confident what the offset from UTC will be at any time in the future. You also need to be a historian to correctly apply it to times in the past - take https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_the_Republic_of_Irelan... as an example!\n \nreply",
      "Even countries that are on UTC don't save you from this. I had no idea until very recently but there is a time that simply never existed in Iceland!Wednesday January 2st 1908 00:00 clocks were turned forward 28 minutes to 00:28. So an entire 28 minutes of time never eexisted in Iceland even thought today they are on UTC year round and one might think they are the best and easiest country to handle timezone wise.https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/1993-November/009236.html\n \nreply"

      "I respectfully have to disagree.  As Fedora packager for OCaml packages, dune's configuration is yet another one-off, with a weird Lisp syntax, hard to understand, difficult to patch.  I'd far rather people stuck to using more familiar Linux build systems.  As an upstream OCaml developer, the whole thing falls down the minute you need to integrate other programming languages into your build (or OCaml code into a code base written in another language).(This rant more or less equally applies to other language-specific build systems.)\n \nreply",
      "As a user of Linux, I wish Linux distributions would abandon their build systems which really only work well for C and maybe C++, and also only work on one platform (not even the whole of linux!) meaning that packaging has to be duplicated for every OS, and stuck to using more familiar language-specific build systems that work everywhere.(this rant more or less equally applies to all os-or-distro-specific build systems)---This rant is only semi-serious. I do see some value in the Linux distribution style packaging. In particular, I do sympathise with the need to do cross-language builds. But goodness are they a pain to work with, and probably the biggest barrier to me shipping software on Linux.My hope is that eventually an evolution on build systems like bazel/buck2 will lead to a truly universal build system that is both cross-platform and cross-language. But unfortunately it doesn't look like it's coming soon.\n \nreply",
      "> more familiar Linux build systems\"Familiar\" is not a property of any system. It's a relation between a system and a user.Some Linux build systems maybe be more familiar to some users, but will be less familiar to others. When picking a build system, you can't just look at the system itself and declare it familiar or not.It's not even enough to look at the total number of users familiar with some thing. Hindi is one of the most familiar languages in the world, but you're probably gonna have a bad time if you use it for the menu in a cafe in rural Texas.You have to look at your actual cohort of users (and potential future users) and see what's familiar to them.

      "> A Redding Police Department officer in 2021 was charged with six misdemeanors after being accused of accessing CLETS to set up a traffic stop for his fianc\u00e9e's ex-husband, resulting in the man's car being towed and impounded, the local outlet A News Cafe reported. Court records show the officer was fired, but he was ultimately acquitted by a jury in the criminal case. He now works for a different police department 30 miles away.When people say \"I don't see why privacy matters, I have nothing to hide\" this is the exact kind of edge-case I always think about.The problem with a lot of these massive surveillance systems is that a lot of people end up with access to them, and some of those people may not be trustworthy.In this case, your ex-wife gets engaged to a cop and now they're abusing their access to databases to cause you harm.(That note that \"he now works for a different police department 30 miles away\" is such a toxic aspect of American policing: cops who get fired for stuff like this inevitably end up in the exact same job somewhere else.)\n \nreply",

      "Very cool app. If you can crack multi-channel output formats (5.1, Atmos) I can see a lot of prosumers who would happily buy the product. Even the most basic tools for Dolby 5.1 are overpriced IMHO and Atmos encoder prices are either far beyond the reach of most DAW users or require use of Pro Tools.One downside of selling into the pro audio market is piracy unfortunately. I learnt that the hard way and ended up having to use iLok.\n \nreply",
      "I assume this can do sound rendering, like simulating a conversation on a subway platform while a subway passes by?Or singing while walking through a tunnel?Since it has capabilities that would be hard to replicate, rather than show the tool on the landing page, I would show the output. Remove the clutter and force people to listen to what the tool can produce.The tool as it is now, is being marketed towards yourself, people that wanted to build that tool and know what it is. But everyone will know what it can do after listening to sample output.\n \nreply",
      "Yes it can do all of those things.You are right about the audio demos, I'll update the frontpage with this soon. Thanks!\n \nreply",
      "It's funny to see this now because I've been for a couple weeks looking into audio spacialization. After a lot of research and even trying to write my own spatializer plugin, I found that Game Engines have probably the most complete toolset to do this task. (Specifically I'm using Godot with https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/).Steam audio is pretty awesome in that regards because it supports HRTF and all the physical based goodies like occlusion/reflection and sound propagation. So you can get really really immersive spatial audio.The only downside with this solution is that you can't do offline rendering. So my question is:can Audiocube do offline rendering? seems like it would be one killer feature for my use case.\n \nreply",
      "It sounds like you\u2019re in a similar field to me so it would be great to connect! Totally agree, yeah Audiocube is built in unity as game engines made the most sense for what I wanted to achieve. Steam audio is super cool and was a lot of use to look at for writing my own stuff.Offline rendering is at the top of my research list currently. It\u2019s not in the app yet. It\u2019s going to take a lot of work to build given that the physics engine calculations are tied to frame rate etc, so there is a lot of work to do - but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible.Thanks!\n \nreply",
      "This is great (in theory). During lockdown I got an ambisonic mic (Rode NF-SFW1) and used it to create Dolby Atmos experiences. The workflow - including sending it to Dolby's tool every time - was such a pain. Adding additional 3d elements was especially annoying and limiting.Unfortunately that's no longer my hobby so can't test this for you but definitely scratches an itch for past me. Nice\n \nreply",
      "That mic looks fun to play with. On their site there\u2019s a link to a bunch of recordings that can be downloaded:https://library.soundfield.com/\n \nreply",
      "Thanks!Yeah, frustration with the existing solutions was one of the main reasons I started this project.I was working in creating immersive audio, and I just found that none of the plugins allowed the level of placement that I wanted. It was all fiddly, and you couldn't easily move the listening position around, while also moving sound sources.I came from an audio engineering background, not programming, so it took me a while to even learn how to make software! But now I made the tool I always needed.\n \nreply",
      "Very cool project! And well done on doing it without being a software eng!How long have you been working on it out of interest?\n \nreply",
      "Thanks! Yeah it was a steep learning curve at the start but I\u2019m very confident now.I started it in 2020 - here\u2019s a blog post about the history https://www.audiocube.app/blog/audiocube-historyI\u2019ve recently got it working on an iPad which was a frustrating grind but I think the concept is a lot of fun on touchscreen!\n \nreply"

You still need to manually click into each one and set it up.Zapier goes a bit further than Make, but it still leaves the workflow with a lot of configuration work that needs to be picked up by the user.In both Make and Zapier, you really need to prompt the AI copilot in a very specific way to get good results. In our case, the AI is designed to use its business analyst/consultant mode to extract information so it can work from very general, unclear and ambiguous instructions to a clearly defined workflow/process to build.The ability for our AI to edit the workflow at any time (including on top of your own manual changes) also means you can have a continuous iterative dialog/interaction with our AI copilot vs a once off interaction at the start. Both Make and Zapier's AI Copilots lack this or are very weak in being able to edit existing workflows reliably.\n \nreply",
      "What exactly is \"your AI\"? From how you describe it, it's a GPT model with a \"You're a business consultant\" prompt.I'm sorry to be rough, but from your description it just sounds like your AI somehow does a better job with prompts compared to Zapier & Make, which is highly subjective.Besides that, this looks very cool and IMO is the future of interfacing AI automations in work environments\n \nreply",
      "Slick UI, curious how practical the workflows actually are. My suspicion is that this is automating the part humans would want to do (designing the workflow), whereas most of the hours put into workflow automation is integration (90% of which is not going to be a clean REST API).That said, maybe this would be really valuable to someone doing a greenfield project without needing to back into existing workflows. Either way, cool project.\n \nreply",

      "I just want to appreciate how well written and thought out this was. I have spent countless hours reading over ethics on AI, especially from Big Tech sources, but this note is leaps beyond. I compare this to the disastrous letter that effectively knee-capped American AI all while proposing flimsy AI ethics within about 500 words (https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experime...). This should be another red flag when America's $500 Billion Stargate project is being led by people including Sam Altman and Larry Ellison, who are singing doomsday prophecies while the Vatican is making sincere efforts to understand AI.I'm really caught admiring this and think this may very well be the AI Magna Carta. There are so many gems and while many of the sources are based on Catholicism, there is also an incredible depth of research, even going into \"On the foundational role of language in shaping understanding, cf. M. Heidegger.\" The note also builds upon numerous different discussions from the Vatican including this supplemental one, https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2024/ju...\n \nreply",
      "It is well thought out. The \"AI Magna Carta\" is a stretch, though.Some good insights:60. Anthropomorphizing AI also poses specific challenges for the development of children, potentially encouraging them to develop patterns of interaction that treat human relationships in a transactional manner, as one would relate to a chatbot. Such habits could lead young people to see teachers as mere dispensers of information rather than as mentors who guide and nurture their intellectual and moral growth. Genuine relationships, rooted in empathy and a steadfast commitment to the good of the other, are essential and irreplaceable in fostering the full development of the human person.That's a good one. Teacher time is a scarce resource, but the chatbot is always there, and undemanding if not asked anything.Kids who grow up talking mostly to AIs may have that kind of relationship with the world. Historically, kids who grew up with servants around sometimes defaulted to that kind of transactional relationship. Now that can scale up. Amusingly, asking Google's AI about \"bringing up children with servants\" produced an excellent summary of the topic.Years ago, the French Catholic author Georges Bernanos warned that \u201cthe danger is not in the multiplication of machines, but in the ever-increasing number of men accustomed from their childhood to desire only what machines can give.\u201dThat's an argument against too much screen time for kids.\n \nreply",
      "Children need human attention to thrive.Classes are WAY too big.There have been several very successful projects focused on getting adults to do homework with children.\n \nreply",
      "It could be argued that the emergence of the web and search engines in particular has established this as a common pattern long before AI was around. I'm not convinced that AI represents a dramatic change to this behavior, though the point about anthropomorphizing AI likely acts as a magnifier.\n \nreply",
      "I think the main difference is the degree of anthropomorphizing that happens with new chatbots. I mean, most kids in the 2000's didn't believe that they were literally asking Jeeves a question, but a lot of users today actually think of AI as an anthropomorphic being.\n \nreply",
      "I'm sure we could extend this farther into the separation of people out of villages into cities and the rise of transactional capitalism.\n \nreply",
      "Reminds me of Inter Mirifica.https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_coun...These are notable because they are not tweets or op-eds, one in thousands produced daily to keep you hooked to a source of information.Rather these are published once by the church as part of their core mission and in response to the events themselves once. There is not necessarily a huge conversation here, although of course there might be conversation that lead to the letter and conversations that arise from the letter, but the center, core of the message from the church is very clear and static. It is long yes, but you only need to read it once and you'll be up to date with the church for years. You don't need to turn the news on everynight or keep your twitter feed clean and stay hooked every 20 minutes.\n \nreply",
      "One may or may not appreciate the religious aspect, but the Vatican has always been a hub for \u201crefined thinkers.\u201d And when it comes to establishing an (initial) point of discussion on such an ethically significant topic, I believe that the amount of thought distilled into this page has been considerable.\n \nreply",
      "The Jesuit order - to which Pope Francis belonged (belongs?) - has a long and notable history of contributing to science and scientific discovery. So they are not just thinkers, but doers.\n \nreply",

      "> The return current on the back is free to spread out, but in practice, it will prefer the path of least resistance \u2014 i.e., the shortest line between the two vias.This is a bit misleading. It does preferentially flow along the shortest path, but not exclusively. It will indeed spread out. It takes all paths with a current proportional to their resistance, not just the shortest path. The percentage of total current that isn't flowing directly along the shortest path is still very significant.Think of it as a bunch of resistors in parallel. The shortest path might be 0.1ohm, and the longest path 10x longer at 1ohm, but current will be flowing along both of those paths. If 1A is flowing down the shortest path, you will still have 100mA down the 10x length path.\n \nreply",
      "> Other than increased miniaturization, the most striking change is the use of copper pours [...] Why did we start doing this?We've been doing something a lot like this for as long as I can remember.Back in the 1990s if there were any big unused copper areas on your PCB you'd mask them to save on etching acid - a gallon of acid would have a lifetime measured in square inches of copper removed, and the less copper you removed, the longer your acid would last.Meanwhile, a lot of DIY etching processes were very basic. Sure, you could get translucent acid and a transparent bath and heat it to a controlled temperature and run bubbles through it and so on. But if you were on a budget, some room temperature ferric chloride in an old ice cream container would get the job done. And getting the etch resist onto the board? You could draw it by hand with special pens, use transfers, there were special printer toner transfer papers, or you could DIY UV photoresist using printable projector transparencies and the sun as your UV source.This was not a super-scientific, tightly controlled process.If you had narrow traces and narrow gaps on one part of your PCB, and large areas of copper to remove on another? Well, if you left it in the acid long enough to remove that large area, could be the narrow traces get etched away too.So masking off any large areas meant all the copper getting etched was about the same width - thus compensating for the poorly controlled etching process.Of course, these days professional PCB manufacturing is orders of magnitude cheaper than it used to be. When you send your design to pcbway or jlcpcb they have much tighter control over the process, so you no longer have to worry about this stuff.\n \nreply",
      "> When you send your design to pcbway or jlcpcb they have much tighter control over the process, so you no longer have to worry about this stuff.Funny that you mention jlcpcb. The last time I submitted a board with tight differential pairs (but still within their listed specs) to them they basically told me to increase the amount of copper, so I assume they had some quality issues in the past:> we have new rule since Dec, 2022, if the copper areas are less than 30% of the board in each copper layer, the space between trace and trace should be at least 0.15mm to avoid short circuit.So I had to add a few copper pours and everything was fine :)\n \nreply",
      "Arguably, the fact that they knew in advance exactly what you would need to do to avoid the issue means their process control is incredible!\n \nreply",
      "Well, you may not have to worry, but if you have large unpoured areas on a design with a professional PCB manufacturer (of the traditional, high-touch kind), they will ask if you want to pour some copper there. Reason being that it makes the process faster, more consistent and reduce possible side-etching on lanes. It may not a make a difference in most cases, but you may just save some time and effort by doing this.\n \nreply",
      "The reason is that the copper is already there, it gets etched away.  So it actually costs more to not have copper than to have it.\n \nreply",
      "The simple explanation is that glue logic and wide busses have mostly disappeared from contemporary electronics. Now you have a smattering of peripherals with point to point links leaving board space for fills that would have been pointless attempting with pervasive Manhattan routing on the outer layers.Solid fills also had a propensity to warp boards, requiring hatched patterns to relieve the imbalance. That constrained their use to boards with sufficient free space to maintain connectivity of the fill areas. PCB manufacturing has improved enough to minimize this concern.\n \nreply",
      "Great article!> To keep things simple, some hobbyists opt for four-layer boards, with the two inner layers dedicated to GND and Vdd. This works, but means paying about twice as much.With the prices out of Shenzhen, there is IMO no reason to use a 2-layer board, outside of trivial cases (Like a CAN terminator etc). 4-layers are a bit more expensive, but make routing much easier. I don't want to spend the time solving the routing puzzle on a two-layer board, then worrying about inductance (the article's topic) on top of that.Baseline 2024 plan: Start with 4-layers as a generic baseline. Go to 6 (or higher?) if your design is sufficiently complex, and/or complex. (Or has high-frequency signals). More layers = more easier.\n \nreply",
      "There is no reason to use 4-layers either. With 6 being so cheap, you can save time on routing and head scratching.\n \nreply",
      "> In electronic circuits, the flow of electrons is confined to conductors, but the transfer of energy doesn\u2019t involve these particles bouncing off each other; instead, the process is mediated through electromagnetic fields. These fields originate from charge carriers, but extend freely into the surrounding space.That's a great couple of sentences; it really clearly explains what's going on.\n \nreply"

      "Fun read.  I am a bit curious on not mentioning OLAP, at all?From my experience, the vast majority of complications in systems is people not realizing they are asking an OLAP question while wanting parts of OLTP semantics.I'm also curious how much of this extra complication comes from having a central database that tries to be a source of truth for everything?  As an easy example, inventory systems that try and have a cloud source of truth have obvious problems when on the ground inventory issues crop up.  That is, a lot of the complication is between the distributed nature of the application and database, sure.  But, another large source is the non-distributed abstraction that a central database can represent not centralized activity.\n \nreply",
      "> I'm also curious how much of this extra complication comes from having a central database that tries to be a source of truth for everything?You can reverse this as 'how much extra complication comes from having many disparate databases, so now you push all ACID complications at the company level instead of the software(rdbms)'It is a tricky problem!Having a single source of truth is a tremendous simplification, especially for the people.It should be ideal that the other databases are pure materializations on top of it, but then not matter what you have the need to input more stuff that is not part of the central one, and now you have both problems.\n \nreply",
      "Single source of truth is different in distributed systems, well the costs are different.Using the language of 'software architecture: thee hard parts' this forces your entire system into a single 'architectural quanta', basically it is a monolith.There are situations where monoliths are acceptable or even the least worst option.The 'Fallacies of distributed computing' covers most of these.It can work better if you use a hierarchical model, but OLTP is almost exclusively the relational model.ACID transactions become pretty brittle, software becomes set in stone etc...There are use cases, but the value proposition is typically much weaker\n \nreply",
      "A single source of truth for facts is fine.  A single source of truth that has to be reflected by external reality?  Less fine.  At that point, you pretty much have to have reconciliation processes to account for when they don't match.Oddly, I'd argue that the better way to view this is that the central database is the materialization of the data sources scattered around where work actually happens.  As such, you have to have constructs that account for provenance and timing introduced there that aren't as necessary at the edges.\n \nreply",
      "> From my experience, the vast majority of complications in systems is people not realizing they are asking an OLAP question while wanting parts of OLTP semantics.If you could elaborate on this further, I and others are probably very interested in reading more about it.\n \nreply",
      "As the sibling says, it is easy to think about in terms of what you are doing with the data.  Reporting on how many transactions of a type have happened over a duration?  Probably OLAP.  Really, if the word \"report\" shows up, at all, probably OLAP.  Executing parts of a workflow for an active transaction?  OLTP.Briefly looking, I can't find the books that I thought covered a lot of this in a good way.  Will keep looking, apologies.\n \nreply",

      "Wow! This is some phenomenal engineering!> Another area that stumped me is how to shut the power off 100% on the device, so that it can remain \u201coff\u201d for weeks or months.This is actually a pretty solvable problem...https://circuitcellar.com/resources/quickbits/soft-latching-...Then the microcontroller can choose at any time to completely shut off the entire circuit (including itself), and extremely little power will be consumed until something (like a button) completes the power-on circuit again.For ease of prototyping, there are off-the-shelf units you can play with: https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-soft-power-switch-jst-2mm....Some more advanced soft power switch circuits (like the SparkFun switch) also include the ability to forcibly power down a misbehaving device by holding down the button.The design used in the SparkFun switch also allows your microcontroller to know if the button is pushed while the device is running, so you could imagine repurposing your existing button to also restore power to the device if the device is off, and still retain the existing functionality for cycling through watch faces. Then, either the device could automatically shut itself off after a period of inactivity or when the battery gets too low, or the user could click and hold the button for some number of seconds to turn the device off completely that way.\n \nreply",

      "No problem. I haven\u2019t had a chance to do anything hardware related for a long time, so it\u2019s fun to think about hardware problems again.On the topic of extending battery life mentioned in the article, one relatively straightforward thing to investigate is simply reducing the processor clock speed. Your application probably doesn\u2019t need to run at full tilt. I think there is a function called setCpuFrequencyMhz \u2014 I think it only works with a few specific frequencies, but the lower the frequency you can pick (while still keeping up with your application\u2019s needs), the less power the system should consume while awake.Of course, you want to be putting the processor to sleep between updates anyways, and there is a trade off between sleeping more (which means running the processor faster so it can sleep sooner, \u201crace to sleep\u201d), versus the inefficiency caused by running a processor higher on the frequency/efficiency curve, so there might be an optimal frequency that isn\u2019t the lowest or the highest possible option. It\u2019s something that would need to be measured.Just some thoughts! It might not make a big difference if the processor is already sleeping most of the time, but I figured I would mention it as something to try.\n \nreply",
      "Another alternative is to use ESP32's deep sleep mode. You can tell ESP to sleep until some event occurs. There are many options for waking up the microcontroller.https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32c...It uses little power, so standard 18650 battery could last years with single charge.https://www.programmingelectronics.com/esp32-deep-sleep-mode\n \nreply",
      "The ESP32-S3 spends most of its time in deep sleep, only waking up for about 5-10 seconds every 5 minutes. The problem I ran into was that not just the ESP32-S3, every component on the board (the accelerometer, the haptic motor driver, the LiPo battery charger, the 3v3 LDO) has a some constant, minimum (quiescent) current draw. And even how your resistors are configured (pullup or pulldown) and their resistance values contributes. To diagnose it, I would need a precision measurement tool like a ($1k) Joulescope https://www.joulescope.com/products/js220-joulescope-precisi... and probably a significant amount of time.\n \nreply",

      "I have also recently been through the same steep learning curve you have and the following worked for me. Reading spec sheets is fine but nothing beats measurement if its feasible. I built a custom PCB with all the power pins for all the peripherals broken out so I could put an ammeter in series with each of them individually. Then I used Nordic's inexpensive power profiler kit 2 (search for Nordic PPK2 - its under $100). Really decent specs at 100kHz sampling rate and 100nA resolution - you connect it to a PC to see the charts. I also bought my own resin 3D printer. They are so cheap these days and it helped with iterating on designs and not having to wait days for things to arrive. PS, great post, loved it.\n \nreply",
      "I had this problem on a low power design. We were making an industrial temperature sensor for something that moved and we needed to run on battery.What I ended up doing was using a second voltage regulator with an enable pin for all the accessories. When the MCU wakes up it turns power on to the accessories and waits for things to stabilize, maybe 1ms or so. Then it does what it needs to do and before going back to sleep turns all the accessories back off.Costs you a few extra parts and a second voltage bus and the hassle of programming but it turns \"small quiescent draw\" into essentially zero. Maybe the regulator has a bit of leak but it should be pico amps or less.\n \nreply",

    "first_paragraph": "My 9 y.o. son has Type 1 diabetes, which basically means his pancreas is on manual (hard) mode 24x7. A healthy pancreas not only produces insulin, which helps convert glucose in the bloodstream into energy - it also produces glucagon, which tells the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream when blood sugar levels are too low. A person with T1D has to manage without either of these guardrails, and a low blood sugar can become a medical emergency if left untreated.We\u2019re lucky to have access to life-changing technology like CGMs and Closed-loop Insulin Pumps, however, they come with their own problems, such as the alarms that go off during a high or low blood sugar. My son\u2019s pump and phone both alarm when he falls below 55 mg/dL. This can happen very quickly in a number of situations - such as if he\u2019s just had lunch, just had a large insulin dose to cover it, and recess afterwards. There\u2019s also playing at the playground, or playing soccer, where he shouldn\u2019t have to run around with "
