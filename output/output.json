      "I don't get the widespread hatred of Gas Town. If you read Steve's writeup, it's clear that this is a big fun experiment.It pushes and crosses boundaries, it is a mixture of technology and art, it is provocative. It takes stochastic neural nets and mashes them together in bizarre ways to see if anything coherent comes out the other end.And the reaction is a bunch of Very Serious Engineers who cross their arms and harumph at it for being Unprofessional and Not Serious and Not Ready For Production.I often feel like our industry has lost its sense of whimsy and experimentation from the early days, when people tried weird things to see what would work and what wouldn't.Maybe it's because we also have suits telling us we have to use neural nets everywhere for everything Or Else, and there's no sense of fun in that.Maybe it's the natural consequence of large-scale professionalization, and stock option plans and RSUs and levels and sprints and PMs, that today's gray hoodie is just the updated gray suit of the past but with no less dryness of imagination.reply",
      "> If you read Steve's writeup, it's clear that this is a big fun experiment:So, Steve has the big scary \"YOU WILL DIE\" statements in there, but he also has this:> I went ahead and built what\u2019s next. First I predicted it, back in March, in Revenge of the Junior Developer. I predicted someone would lash the Claude Code camels together into chariots, and that is exactly what I\u2019ve done with Gas Town. I\u2019ve tamed them to where you can use 20\u201330 at once, productively, on a sustained basis.\"What's next\"? Not an experiment. A prediction about how we'll work. The word \"productively\"? \"Productively\" is not just \"a big fun experiment.\" \"Productively\" is what you say when you've got something people should use.Even when he's giving the warnings, he says things like \"If you have any doubt whatsoever, then you can\u2019t use it\" implying that it's ready for the right sort of person to use, or \"Working effectively in Gas Town involves committing to vibe coding.\", implying that working effectively with it is possible.Every day, I go on Hacker News, and see the responses to a post where someone has an inconsistent message in their blog post like this.If you say two different and contradictory things, and do not very explicitly resolve them, and say which one is the final answer, you will get blamed for both things you said, and you will not be entitled to complain about it, because you did it to yourself.reply",
      "I agree, I\u2019m one of the Very Serious Engineers and I liked Steve\u2019s post when I thought it was sort of tongue in cheek but was horrified to come to the HN comments and LinkedIn comments proclaiming Gastown as the future of engineering. There absolutely is a large contingent of engineers who believe this, and it has a real world impact on my job if my bosses think you can just throw a dozen AI agents at our product roadmap and get better productivity than an engineer. This is not whimsical to me, I\u2019m getting burnt out trying to navigate the absurd expectations of investors and executives with the real world engineering concerns of my day to day job.reply",
      "I think Steve's idea of an agent coordinator and the general model could make sense.  There is a lot of discussion (and even work from Anthropic, OpenAI, etc) around multiagent workflows.Is Gas Town the implementation?  I'm not sure.What is interesting is seeing how this paradigm can help improve one's workflow.  There is still a lot of guidance and structuring of prompts / claude.md / whichever files that need to be carefully written.If there is a push for the equivalent of helm charts and crds for gas town, then I will be concerned.reply",
      "AI is such a fun topic -- the hype makes it easy to loath, but as a coder working with Claude I think it's an awesome tool.Gastown looks like a viable avenue for some app development. One of the most interesting things I've noticed about AI development is that it forces one to articulate desired and prohibited behaviors -- a spec becomes a true driving force.Yegge's posts are always hyperbolic and he consistently presents interesting takes on the industry so I'm willing to cut him a buttload of slack.reply",

      "I too am a Very Serious Engineer but my shock is in the other direction: of course the ideas behind Gas Town are the future of software development and several VSEs I know are developing a proper, robust, engineering version of it that works. As the author of this article here remarks \u201cyes, but Steve did it first\u201d, and it annoys me that if I had written this post nobody would have read it, but also that, because I intend to use it in Very Serious Business ($bns) my version isn\u2019t ready to a actually be published yet.

      "Based on the number of times I've seen these posted about they seem quite frequent[0]. If I'm being honest, the entire BGP system seems to be very fragile with a massive blast radius. I get that it's super 'core' so it's hard to fix, and that it comes from a time when the Internet was more 'cooperative' (in the protocol sense of the word) but are there any attempts at a successor or is it impossible to do so fundamentally?Surely the notion of who owns an AS should be cryptographically held so that an update has to be signed. Updates should be infrequent so the cost is felt on the control plane, not on the data plane.I'm sure there's a BGPSec or whatever like all the other ${oldTech}Sec but I don't know if there is a realistic solution here or if it's IPv6 style tech.0: I looked it up before posting and it's 3000 leakers with 12 million leaks per quarter https://blog.qrator.net/en/q3-2022-ddos-attacks-and-bgp-inci...reply",
      "Globally, it is as you want it to be.Locally, BGP is peer-to-peer \u2014 literally! \u2014 and no particular peer is forced to check everything, and nobody's even trying to make a single global routing table so local agreements can override anything at a higher level.reply",
      "I see. That makes sense.reply",
      "A route leak is often like this: an ISP in Pakistan is ordered to censor YouTube, so they add a route internally to YouTube's IP addresses that passes to their censoring machine, or to nowhere. They accidentally have their edge routers configured to pass this route to all their connected networks instead of keeping it internally to themselves. Some of their peers recognize this as the shortest route to YouTube and install it into their own networks. Others recognize it's not the real YouTube and ignore it. Transit providers check route authorization more thoroughly than peers, so none of them accept it and the route doesn't spread globally.reply",
      "That's like what, one major incident per month now, Nov 18, Dec 5, and now this one?I'll bet JGC can write his own ticket by now, but unretiring would be really bad optics. He's on the board though and still keeping a watchful eye. But a couple more of these and CFs reputation will be in the gutter.reply",
      "That\u2019s what I also thought when I saw this incident. I wonder if there\u2019s something up internally at Cloudflare or that it was always like this.I feel like something such as a route leak should not be something that happens to Cloudflare. I\u2019m surprised they set their systems up to allow this human error.reply",
      "John left in April last year I think so it probably isn't directly related, so please take my comment in jest, but still it is worrisome, CF is in many ways 'too big to fail' and if this really becomes a regular thing it is going to cause a lot of people focused on their 'nines' to be pissed off.reply",
      "I do appreciate these post mortems from Cloudflare, however I wish they would include timestamps of their status page posts in their timelines.In this case, the timeline states \"IMPACT STOP\" was at 20:50 UTC and the first post to their status page was 12 minutes later at 21:02 UTC:\"Cloudflare experienced a Network Route leak, impacting performance for some networks beginning 20:25 UTC. We are working to mitigate impact.\"reply",
      "> we pushed a change via our policy automation platform to remove the BGP announcements from MiamiIs there any way to test these changes against a simulation of real world routes? Including to ensure that traffic that shouldn\u2019t hit Cloudflare servers, continues to resolve routes that don\u2019t hit Cloudflare?I have to imagine there\u2019s academic research on how to simulate a fork of global BGP state, no? Surely there\u2019s a tensor representation of the BGP graph that can be simulated on GPU clusters?If there\u2019s a meta-rule I think of when these incidents occur, it\u2019s that configuration rules need change management, and change management is only as good as the level of automated testing. Just because code hasn\u2019t changed doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t test the baseline system behavior. And here, that means testing that the Internet works.reply",
      "I don't know why you would need a tensor whatever. Dump the state of the router (which peers are connected and for how long what routes are they advertising and for how long) as well as the computed routing table and what routes are advertised to peers.Set a simulation router to have the same state but a new config, and compute the routing table and what routes would he advertised to peers.Confirm the diff in routing table and advertised routes is reasonable.This change seemed to mostly be about a single location. Other BGP config changes leading to problems are often global changes, but you can check diffs and apply the config change one host at a time. You can't really make a simultaneous change anyway. Maybe one host changing is ok, but the Nth one causes a problem... CF has a lot of BGP routers, so maybe checking every diff is too much, but at least check a few.Is that something out of the box on routers? I don't know, people with BGP routers never let me play with them. But given the BGP haiku, I'd want something like that before I messed around with things. For the price you pay for these fancy routers, you should be able to buy an extra few to run sandboxed config testing on. You could also simulate with open source bgp software, but the proprietary BGP daemon on the router might not act like the open source one does.reply"

      "FYI BitLocker is on by default in Windows 11. The defaults will also upload the BitLocker key to a Microsoft Account if available.This is why the FBI can compel Microsoft to provide the keys. It's possible, perhaps even likely, that the suspect didn't even know they had an encrypted laptop. Journalists love the \"Microsoft gave\" framing because it makes Microsoft sound like they're handing these out because they like the cops, but that's not how it works. If your company has data that the police want and they can get a warrant, you have no choice but to give it to them.This makes the privacy purists angry, but in my opinion it's the reasonable default for the average computer user. It protects their data in the event that someone steals the laptop, but still allows them to recover their own data later from the hard drive.Any power users who prefer their own key management should follow the steps to enable Bitlocker without uploading keys to a connected Microsoft account.reply",
      "> Any power users who prefer their own key management should follow the steps to enable Bitlocker without uploading keys to a connected Microsoft account.Except the steps to to that are disable bitlocker, create a local user account (assuming you initially signed in with a Microsoft account because Ms now forces it on you for home editions of windows), delete your existing keys from OneDrive, then re-encrypt using your local account and make sure not to sign into your Microsoft account or link it to Windows again.A much more sensible default would be to give the user a choice right from the beginning much like how Apple does it. When you go through set up assistant on mac, it doesn't assume you are an idiot and literally asks you up front \"Do you want to store your recovery key in iCloud or not?\"reply",
      "> make sure not to sign into your Microsoft account or link it to Windows againThat's not so easy. Microsoft tries really hard to get you to use a Microsoft account. For example, logging into MS Teams will automatically link your local account with the Microsoft account, thus starting the automatic upload of all kinds of stuff unrelated to MS Teams.In the past I also had Edge importing Firefox data (including stored passwords) without me agreeing to do so, and then uploading those into the Cloud.Nowadays you just need to assume that all data on Windows computers is available to Microsoft; even if you temporarily find a way to keep your data out of their hands, an update will certainly change that.reply",

Any idea, belief, or concept can be boiled down to its essence. Like a map, mental models highlight key information while ignoring irrelevant details. They\u2019re tools for compressing complexity into manageable chunks.Mental models help us understand the world. For example, velocity shows that both speed and direction matter. Reciprocity reveals how being positive and taking initiative gets the world to do most of the work for you. Margin of Safety reminds us that things don\u2019t always go as planned. Relativity exposes our blind spots and shows how a different perspective can reveal new information. These are just a few examples.If you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries. You don\u2019t have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it\u2019s not that hard to do.T"

The Microkorg 2 is the update of its record-setting best-seller built around \"here is a giant preset knob that has sounds organized by genre\". You can program a Microkorg and it does have plenty of depth, but the general idea of it is to be a go-to \"recall\" box for the quintessential synth sounds.While the feature is useful, in some senses it's not terribly important to have a sound be exact, because you're giving a performance to the circumstance.

But the reality is, if I bought this device it would end up spending most of its time in the basement graveyard with all the other cool tools that are too narrow, too big, too hard to interface, store/recall patches, etc.I decided several years ago to refocus on a stack that's purely microphone (or other a/d converted input) + MIDI controllers to a DAW driving infinite layers of internal real-time digital synthesis, analog modeling and effects plug-ins. There are fabulously expressive MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) controllers now which can capture every nuance of input my hands, feet and breath could ever provide. As you highlighted, the feeling that creating in a digital audio workstation is \"too easy\" or maybe somehow  'soulless' - is all in my head. That lurking suspicion analog circuitry or electro-mechanical waveforms are more authentic or pure is just magical thinking.Always believing that the next new box's cool-looking tactile input, novel interaction model or unique set of opinionated constraints will unleash my creativity - is just getting in the way of actually sitting down and making myself create with all the insanely powerful, wildly creative, infinitely flexible, hyper-productive digital tools I already have. Being able to save and recall entire racks worth of patching at the press of a button isn't soulless or limiting - unless I let it be.

      "Awesome article Ken, I feel spoiled! It's always nice to see your posts hit HN!Out of curiosity: Is there anything you feel they could have done better in hindsight? Useless instructions, or inefficient ones, or \"missing\" ones? Either down at the transistor level, or in high level design/philosophy (the segment/offset mechanism creating 20 bit addresses out of 2 16-bit registers with thousands of overlaps sure comes to mind - if not a flat model, but that's asking too much to 1979 design and transistor limitations I guess) ?Thanks!reply",
      "That's an interesting question. Keep in mind that the 8086 was built as a stopgap processor to sell until Intel's iAPX 432 \"micro-mainframe\" processor was completed. Moreover, the 8086 was designed to be assembly-language compatible with the 8080 (through translation software) so it could take advantage of existing software. It was also designed to be compatible with the 8080's 16-bit addressing while supporting more memory.Given those constraints, the design of the 8086 makes sense. In hindsight, though, considering that the x86 architecture has lasted for decades, there are a lot of things that could have been done differently. For example, the instruction encoding is a mess and didn't have an easy path for extending the instruction set. Trapping on invalid instructions would have been a good idea. The BCD instructions are not useful nowadays. Treating a register as two overlapping 8-bit registers (AL, AH) makes register renaming difficult in an out-of-order execution system. A flat address space would have been much nicer than segmented memory, as you mention. The concept of I/O operations vs memory operations was inherited from the Datapoint 2200; memory-mapped I/O would have been better. Overall, a more RISC-like architecture would have been good.I can't really fault the 8086 designers for their decisions, since they made sense at the time. But if you could go back in a time machine, one could certainly give them a lot of advice!reply",
      "> I can't really fault the 8086 designers for their decisions, since they made sense at the time. But if you could go back in a time machine, one could certainly give them a lot of advice!Thanks for capturing my feeling very precisely! I was indeed thinking what they could have done better with the same approximate number of transistor and the benefit of a time traveler :) And yes the constraints you mention (8080 compatibility, etc) indeed limit their leeway so maybe we'd have to point the time machine at a few years earlier and influence the 8080 firstreply",
      "Did it make things simpler or more complex for the byte order they picked?  It is notable that new RISC designs not much later all started big endian, implying that is simpler.  Can you even tell the endianess from the dies?reply",
      "The byte order doesn't make much difference. The more important difference compared to a typical RISC chip is that the 8086 supports unaligned memory access. So there's some complicated bus circuitry to perform two memory accesses and shuffle the bytes if necessary.To understand why the 8086 uses little-endian, you need to go back to the Datapoint 2200, a 1970 desktop computer / smart terminal built from TTL chips (since this was pre-microprocessor). RAM was too expensive at the time, so the Datapoint 2200 used Intel shift-register memory chips along with a 1-bit serial ALU. To add numbers one bit at a time, you need to start with the lowest bit to handle carries, so little-endian is the practical ordering.Datapoint talked to Intel and Texas Instruments about replacing the board full of TTL chips with a single-chip processor. Texas Instruments created the TMX1795 processor and Intel slightly later created the 8008 processor. Datapoint rejected both chips and continued using TTL. Texas Instruments tried to sell the TMX1795 to Ford as an engine controller, but they were unsuccessful and the TMX1795 disappeared. Intel, however, marketed the 8008 chip as a general-purpose processor, creating the microprocessor as a product (along with the unrelated 4-bit 4004). Since the 8008 was essentially a clone of the Datapoint 2200 processor, it was little-endian. Intel improved the 8008 with the 8080 and 8085, then made the 16-bit 8086, which led to the modern x86 line. For backward compatibility, Intel kept the little-endian order (along with other influences of the Datapoint 2200). The point of this history is that x86 is little-endian because the Datapoint 2200 was a serial processor, not because little-endian makes sense. (Big-endian is the obvious ordering. Among other things, it is compatible with punch cards where everything is typed left-to-right in the normal way.)reply",
      "Big-endian matches the way we commonly write numbers, but if you have to deal with multiple word widths or greater than word-width math I find little-endian much more straightforward because LE has the invariant that bit value = 2^bit_index and byte value = 2^(8byte_index).E.g. a 1 in bit 7 on a LE system always represnts 2^7 for 8/16/32/64/ whatever bit word widths.This is emphatically not true in BE systems and as evidence I offer that IBM (natively BE), MIPS natively BE) and ARM (natively LE but with a BE mode) all have different mappings of bit and byte indices/lanes in larger word widths* while all LE systems assign the bit/byte lanes the same way.Using the bit 7 example- IBM 8-bit: bit 7 is in byte 0 and equal to 2^0- IBM 16-bit: bit 7 is in byte o and equal to 2^8- IBM 32-bit: bit 7 is in byte 0 and equal to 2^25\u2010 MIPS 16-bit: bit 7 is in byte 1 and equal to 2^7- MIPS 32-bit: bit 7 is in byte 3 and is equal to 2^7- ARM 32-bit BE: bit 7 is in byte 0 and is equal to 2^31Vs. every single LE system, regardless of word width- bit N is in byte (N//8) and is equal to 2^N(And of course none of these match how ethernet orders bits/bytes, but that's a different topic)reply",
