      "The code of TCC (0.9.26) is kind hard to compile, I have discovered in the past year, while developing a minimal C compiler to compile the TCC sources [1]. For that reason, I have concluded that TCC is its own test set. It uses the constant 0x80000000, which is an edge case for if you want to print it as a signed integer only using 32-bit operators. There is a switch statement with an post-increment operator in the switch expression. There are also switch statements with fall throughs and with goto statements in the cases. It uses the ## operator where the result is the name of a macro. Just to name a few.[1] https://github.com/FransFaase/MES-replacementreply",
      "You have simply made one tiny step, that the guys who used AI and $25,000 to write a C compiler in Rust, could not make:You are using the compiler to compile itself.\"TCC is its own test set.\" Absolutely brilliant.reply",
      "One of the coolest tricks is using tcc to compile \"on demand.\" This allows you to use a compiled language like Nim for scripting, with almost no noticeable performance difference compared to interpreted languages.  #!/usr/bin/env -S nim r --cc:tcc -d:useMalloc --verbosity:0 --hints:off --tlsEmulation:on --passL:-lm\n  echo \"Hello from Nim via TCC!\"\n\nHere's a comparison (bash script at [1]) of a minimal binary compiled this way with different interpreters. First line is the noise.

Even with `-d:release` compiling nim code is comparable.The fact that tcc compilation cycle measures negative here is a nice punchline.[1]: https://gist.github.com/ZoomRmc/58743a34d3bb222aa5ec02a5e2b6...[2]: https://github.com/c-blake/bu/blob/main/doc/tim.mdreply",

More likely the AI would work like two $90k junior engineers, but without a need to pay for a vacation, office space, social security, etc. If the productivity ends up higher than this, it's pure profit; I suppose this is their bet.The human engineer would be like a tech lead guiding a tea of juniors, only designing plans and checking results above the level of code proper, but for exceptional cases, like when a human engineer would look at the assembly code a compiler has produced.This does sound exaggeratedly optimistic now, but does not sound crazy.reply",

(Note also Jens Axel Soegaard's recent work on WASM with a Racket-related compiler.)* Racket's rehosting atop Chez seems like a good idea, and I'd guess that the Racket internals are now easier to work with than Guile's.* Racket has done a lot of great work, and is a nice platform for people who can choose their tools without worrying about employability keywords for their resume.  It made some missteps for broader adoption when it had a chance, and several of the most prominent industry practitioner contributors left.* Racket still has the best metaprogramming facilities, AFAIK.  But even more important than `syntax-parse` and `#lang`, one thing I'd really like from Guile and other Schemes is to support Racket's module system.(I really like the ability to define Racket submodules inline, in fragments, for things like embedded unit tests <https://docs.racket-lang.org/overeasy/> and embedded API docs <https://docs.racket-lang.org/mcfly/>.)(I also wanted to play with Racket's module system for PL research compilers: having early compiler implementation for a new language first expand into Scheme code, and then later (with submodules) also do native/VM code generation, while keeping the option to still expand to Scheme code (for better development tools, or for when changing the language).  For example, imagine targeting a microcontroller or a GPU.)* Right now, any Scheme is for people who don't have to do techbro/brogrammer interviews.  The field has been in a bad place for awhile, professionalism-wise, and the troubled economy (and post-ZIRP disruption of the familiar VC growth investment scams) and the push to \"AI\" robo-plagiarism (albeit with attendant new investment scams) are suddenly making the field worse for ICs.reply",

This is a case of Hims and Hers (and other compounding pharmacies) marketing drugs without having been granted approval.There is an abbreviated application for new drug approval (ANDA) pathway meant for generics, but it does not seem like H&H has gone this route. It does require you to open your supply chain up to inspections and to provide evidence that your generic version basically works the same as the brand name.In my opinion there two things going on here that I strongly feel are true.1. Something is systemically wrong in the US when we are cutting off people\u2019s access to meds, like GLP-1s, which have profound health benefits.2. Hims and Hers are also in the wrong.

      "This is cool! There's a lot of bad (and by bad, I mean misaligned with modern voice science and science-informed pedagogy) on the internet, so it's nice to see a resource striving to organize some good information.A couple recommendations I'd suggest exploring to be even better aligned with current understanding:Current literature does not distinguish between head voice and falsetto. While \"falsetto\" often carries a connotation of breathiness, that is not inherent to the register. Both are referred to in literature as laryngial mode M2, in which the Cricothyroid muscle is dominant in shaping the vocal folds. In contrast, chest voice or M1 is Thyroarytenoid dominant. While that may be a bit in the weeds, I found wrapping my head around this very helpful in cutting through a lot of confusing language around head voice .Use of these different registers changes across genre and voice type. Classical sopranos and mezzos use head voice in their upper range, while musical theatre sopranos and mezzos bring their chest voice up (i.e. belting). Meanwhile, tenors and basses typically use chest voice for their full range in both classical and musical theatre genres, with much more use of head voice in pop/contemporary genres.One other suggestion is to more prominently feature SOVTs (semi occluded vocal tract exercises). You reference them in your warm up section (lip trills and straw phonation) but these are highly effective and evidence-based tools to develop efficient phonation.Further, for anyone looking to learn to sing (and anyone can learn to sing!), there's no better resource than a voice teacher. Most teachers nowadays teach online as well as in person. A great place to start looking for a teacher is through NATS or ICVT.reply",
      "> Current literature does not distinguish between head voice and falsetto.Hmm, are you sure about this? I thought chest voice and head voice were understood to be a single register called the modal register. And falsetto was fundamentally different.reply",
      "Yes, though again, the language around registration gets really messy. Here's a great article (with a great title!) from the Journal of Singing by Christian T. Herbst \"Registers\u2014The Snake Pit of Voice Pedagogy\": https://www.nats.org/_Library/JOS_On_Point/JOS-077-02-2020-1...One relevant excerpt before the article goes into several pages discussing M11 vs M2:> These four laryngeal mechanisms are typically termed as: vocal fry (M0, pulse\nregister); chest voice (M1, modal register); falsetto (M2, head voice?); and whistle register (M3).Another article by Dr. Ingo Titze (an icon in the field of voice science and basically the father of SOVTs) about the debated \"mix\" register, starts this way:> One is called chest voice, full voice, or modal voice, which is described by\na vibratory mechanism that some have labeled M1. Acoustically, harmonic energy above the fundamental dominates the sound spectrum in this register. The other anchor is called falsetto or light head voice, which is described by a\nvibratory mechanism labeled M2.(from https://vocology.utah.edu/_resources/documents/mixed_registr...)reply",
      "Thanks for adding your thoughts. First tenor here with a high C+ when trained and active. I lost my (true) falsetto 10 or so years ago, any tips on how to get it back?Also I lost my whistle register 30 years ago, but I think this is normal :)reply",
      "Yes! This is something I've been working on - not for the sake of the M2 mode itself (head voice / falsetto), but because M2 development tends to help with high notes in M1. When I started studying with my current teacher, my M2 felt somewhere between absent or very weak.Typically exercises I work on for M2 start with an SOVT (typically straw phonation, puffy cheeks, or water bubbles) and then transitioning to an [u] vowel on a five note descending scale. For me, at least, while this can be very unstable depending on the day, M2 is much more easily accessible with an SOVT.You might also start with a gentle SOVT in M1/chest and siren up as high as is comfortable without pushing/pressing or trying to be loud. Don't think about registration, just let it go - SOVTs tend to let the voice go where it wants easily.Highly recommend my teacher's book: https://www.pluralpublishing.com/publications/a-systematic-a...reply",

The predisposition is largely the same for everybody (vocal pathologies excluded).The reason why most people can't just naturally sing well is that singing is not a primary biological function, but a bi-product of a survival mechanism (vocal folds, aka airflow control / airway protection).The muscles interacting with the vocal folds (thyroarytenoid and cricothyroid) have antagonistic function and work on reflexes rather than control, so the hard part of learning how to sing is to train them to coordinate properly rather than work against each other.reply",

A fun clip-path calculation that I used here (clip-path: circle(calc(1.42 * 100vmax) at 0 0);) is based on the vmax, which is the larger of the viewport width or height. Then multiplied it by 1.42, because 1.42 is the square root of 2, which is the ratio of the width to the height of the viewport.The second clip-path is a polygon that is used to simulate the \"ray\".\nThe polygon is hardcoded now, but it can be calculated with js, for dynamic dimension that respect the navigation dim"

    "first_paragraph": "In this article I will describe a technique that can often compress the chroma data of an image to less than 0.5 bits per pixel on average, without visible artifacts.A common technique in the field of image and video compression is to convert RGB images to YCrCb before compression. Instead of representing color as red, green and blue channels, we represent them as luminance (Y) and chrominance (Cr and Cb) channels.One of the main advantages is that Y contains most of the information, while the chroma channels can be represented in a lower resolution without the human eye detecting it (something that was actually used as early as in the 1930\u2019s-1960\u2019s for color television, where the chroma channels occupied less signal bandwidth than the luma channel).Note: Throughout the article we assume that the luma channel (Y) is available when compressing and reconstructing the chroma data. The luma information would typically be compressed in some other clever manner (e.g. using a frequency transf"

      "> If the goal isn't actively set to help and streamline the processIn the reimbursements example, the goal shifted, by design.  The environment moved from high-trust to low-trust as the department grew, and the aim moved from \"keeping people happy\" to \"spending less money\"/\"not being taken advantage of\".  Not defending it -- I hate paperwork like this -- but it seems almost inevitable as groups of any kind grow large enough and you actually can't assume good faith anymore.reply",
      "It also depends on your legal system and how much discretion it allows managers. Let me give you an example: my startup used to allow people to expense a car rental when travelling to HQ in the Bay Area, which was in general cheaper than Ubering everywhere (a daily Corolla is cheaper than two Uber rides per day unless the hotel is extremely close to the office). Some people decided to abuse that, fly in on a Saturday, rent a rather expensive car, drive the whole day around, then expense all that.After someone noticed this was happening, the CEO decided to forbid expensing car rentals, instead of having to come up with a very detailed policy. The thing is that in my home country, the abusers' managers would have been allowed to simply deny the reimbursement on discretion, on grounds that those joy rides were unreasonable, which would easily hold in court (where a plaintiff would be automatically forced to pay the defender's attorney fees too). But due to the highly litigious US legal system, a CEO can't allow that and companies must have extremely detailed policies, otherwise they risk very costly lawsuits where even if they win they'd lose a lot of money.reply",
      "Over the long term, yes. However, universities like Buffalo might have some peculiarities. They are overall run by the state government, and professors/students/staff are state employees. In addition, the money that pays their salary often comes from the federal government (NSF, DOE, NIH) which comes with their own restrictions and regulations beyond typical accounting practices.So things like reimbursements are handled by a university trying to implement a state government's interpretation of both granting agencies desires and federal and state laws/regulations.My university seems to be going crazy with rules lately. My hypothesis is that the state, and by extension the university, wants to button down everything so as not draw attention of the federal government (given who is in charge).

The other feels adversarial and paternalistic.reply",
      "Joanne probably had to field some \"sorry, this can't be expensed\" situations, and/or those were reduced because people knew another human was doing the work and they'd get called out, trying to game/abuse the system was less or just naturally discouraged. That was high trust, by both the employee and by Joanne.With the employees needing to use Concur directly, there's a tendency, since there's a diversity in how each employee will handle the specifics, to try to \"save money\" by denying reimbursements for any random violation, making sure all i's were dotted and t's crossed. The automated system itself encourages this because it's so low effort to deny and send the expense form back, potentially wearing down the employe that they just give up. Joanne could avoid all that at scale because there was little/no diversity in how expenses were handled. If an i needed to be dotted, she could handle it, and she knew all the i's that needed to be dotted across all expense reports.I currently have someone to handle my expense reports who sits in front of Concur for me! And that person routinely asks me for specific detail without me having to mess with Concur at all, things like \"who was at this dinner you gave me a receipt for\" or \"I can't find the receipt for this company card charge\".reply",

It is a bit less work for us than the paper forms I started my career with.  It does rather push the overhead of claiming the expense onto the claimers though,  many of which tend to be those whose time is most expensive. I'm not sure it works out.reply",

Honestly, despite the 30-day turnaround, it was the most seamless reimbursement experience I've ever had.But over time the department grew, and Joann moved on. The university partnered with Concur, as corporations do, forcing us to file our own travel reimbursements through this system. Fine, I thought, more work for me, but it can't be too bad.
