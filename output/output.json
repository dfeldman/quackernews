      "I agree with each and every single slide in this presentation; I do. I also know that in each and every company I have ever worked for, none of this is going to fly. Especially, \"Attending meetings is a choice.\" Just like paying taxes is a choice; got it.---For decades, I have been asking for agendas; I have asked for clarification on what to do to prepare; I have even suggested that we have solid outcomes. None of which are followed nor what anyone else wants.Even as a leader at organizations where I can enforce this on my team, it makes absolutely no difference. Hell, Google Calendar (we use Workspace at my current org) doesn't even have solid support for good meeting invite commentary. And, even if it did, 99.99999% of folks wouldn't read any of it anyway.reply",
      "> I also know that in each and every company I have ever worked for, none of this is going to fly.My favourite part of climbing the corporate ladder is finally having enough clout to just say \"no\".> I have been asking for agendas; I have asked for clarification on what to do to prepare; I have even suggestedTry \"I am unable to attend meeting without an agenda. Let me know when one has been posted.\" in your decline message. Do you sound like a dick? Yes. Does it work? Also yes, unless you weren't actually required in that meeting, in which case it becomes a self-solving problem.reply",
      "And then you risk people making stupid decisions, which you have to fix later on, because you didn't attend the meeting.Sometimes it's not just about whether others think you should be there.reply",
      "> And then you risk people making stupid decisions, which you have to fix later on, because you didn't attend the meeting.If you are the one responsible for the work to fix something, you need to be the one driving the meetings or pushing alternative communication.This is why all of the generic \u201cjust say no to meetings\u201d advice is useless: It\u2019s all dependent on the context. You can\u2019t just decline meetings from your boss\u2019s boss without good reason, for example.A lot of snarky internet advice about saying \u201cno\u201d at the office is just people venting or doing imaginary role play. In a real office you have to push for communication, pull details out of people, identify who you need to report to and who you can safely decline.If you get in a situation where you\u2019re declining meetings and the responsibility for content of that meeting lands in your lap, you have made a severe misjudgment. These things are easy to clarify with a little proactive communication, but you get nowhere if you just say \u201cno\u201d or send off a singular \u201cagenda plz\u201d email and then forget about it. People are busy. You have to push and make it clear what you need from them, following up if it doesn\u2019t come.reply",
      "I\u2019d amend that to \u201cA lot of \u2026 advice \u2026 is just people \u2026 doing imaginary role play.\u201dA lot of bad advice out there, being delivered with confidence.",
      "I echo the parents sentiment - I don\u2019t need to be there for a one hour meeting while 12 people give a perspective on a topic, but if you make the wrong decision I will say no.My job as a higher level manager is to ensure that whoever is there on our behalf avoids stupid decisions being made, and if I can\u2019t delegate that then I need to go myself. Sometimes its unavoidable, and sometimes politics prevail but 95% of the time making my priorities clear to my team and being consistent in my them has the correct outcome.reply",
      "This can lead to weird dynamics. A lot of workplaces, no one seems to have direct power (or incentive!) to say \"yes\" to anything but lots of people (including 3 teams you weren't even aware existed) are able to \"provide feedback\" or say no.This leads to all progress being achieved very slowly if at all, or by using the element of surprise and then seeking forgiveness.reply",
      "> if you make the wrong decision I will say noWhile I know your heart is in the right place, as someone with a reporting structure on both sides, I can tell you that this kind of handholding is the entire reason they keep making bad decisions. You must let people fail, and from there your entire job is ensuring that winding back that decision is the responsibility of the people who made it. Few decisions are irreversible, and everything will almost always work out in the end despite how it feels at the time -- but letting people fail, then making them clean up after themselves, is possibly the absolute best teaching method out there.reply",
      "I think you\u2019re reading into a hip fire comment here - I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll override any decision you make that i disagree with. Simply that if push comes to shove my team should feel empowered to make a decision and bring it to me for \u201cass covering\u201d knowing that I will challenge them on it if I disagree, but also feeling confident that they know how I\u2019ll feel about it before they make that call. I trust them to do this without me there.Blindly allowing someone to make a bad call without questioning it is as bad as overruling their call without any explanation!reply",
      "If you have a team member you don\u2019t trust to make good calls, then you need to coach them.reply"

      "If you're trying to build AI based applications you can and should compare the costs between vendor based solutions and hosting open models with your own hardware.On the hardware side you can run some benchmarks on the hardware (or use other people's benchmarks) and get an idea of the tokens/second you can get from the machine. Normalize this for your usage pattern (and do your best to implement batch processing where you are able to, which will save you money on both methods) and you have a basic idea of how much it would cost per token.Then you compare that to the cost of something like GPT5, which is a bit simpler because the cost per (million) token is something you can grab off of a website.You'd be surprised how much money running something like DeepSeek (or if you prefer a more established company, Qwen3) will save you over the cloud systems.That's just one factor though.

There was a huge jump in capability from Sonnet 4 to Sonnet 4.5. We are still internally testing Opus 4.5, which is the first version of Opus priced low enough to use in production.

      "Once a contract is deployed on the blockchain, its source code is immutable. So before using a contract, check if it gives permission to its deployer (or any address) to change any state at will.Note that some contracts act as proxy to other contract and can be made to point to another code through a state change, if this is the case then you need to trust whoever can change the state to point to another contract. Such contract sometime have a timelock so that if such a change occurs, there's a delay before it is actually activated, which gives time to users to withdraw their funds if they do not trust the update.If you are talking about Oracle contracts, if it's an oracle involving offchain data, then there will always be some trust involved, which is usually managed by having the offchain actors share the responsibility and staking some money with the risk to get slashed if they turn into bad actors.

      "I typically jump on the latest macOS with enthusiasm. I once made the mistake to install the beta version of the next os, and well, that didn't go well for me. But typically, within X.1, I'm there.However something shifted since this \"visionOS\" melted version of macOS (Tahoe); where I have absolutely no intension to upgrade from Sequoia. I hope they will fix it by the time I'll be forced to upgrade (post support deadline).It started with the macOS that brought the iOS settings panel. We went from a logical structure of easily findable stuff to a complete mess. Just open the \"Keyboard\" settings on macOS today and it's bewildering how they could ship this and think this is fine. Steve would roll in his grave.The process to allow running applications that are unsigned is just a horrible hack. It feels like a last minute \"shove it and move on!\".By 2035 I wonder if we'll be all running KDE or WindowMaker and the hell with modern OS GUI.From a Gestalt standpoint, human relations with desktop computers are not the same as with thumb driven mobile OS or air-pinch driven vision OS, period.

      "> It started with the macOS that brought the iOS settings panel. We went from a logical structure of easily findable stuff to a complete mess.It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint when exactly the decline started. But one key event before the Settings app was the Catalyst apps that were straight out and dismal ports from their iOS versions. Till date, none of those work well and cannot be navigated properly using the keyboard. Reminders, Messages, Notes and more.Craig Federighi seems to be increasingly taking on so much authority without having a trusted set of people under him and his leadership (or lack of it) has resulted in neglecting software across device platforms. Some of the Apple apps on tvOS with paid subscriptions are worse, because the bugs in them don\u2019t get any attention at all.reply",

And since then Mac OS updates have continued to be secondary/lesser to iOS.Mac OS is still my system of choice, but I don\u2019t have as much confidence in it as I would like.The big thing from around fifteen years ago is the mixed modes for autosave, where they sort of half heartedly changed the language around save/save as and just sort of\u2026 left it. Some apps use their new (for the 2010s) auto save system and some don\u2019t. And it\u2019s up the the user to muddle through. Weird.

Notes has started doing random bolding, unbolding, changing text size on only one line, etc. After a restart, a finder window with tabs springs to different screen spaces, depending on which tab is open when I try to drop a file on it. Message sometimes draws a few lines of a message with a few pixels vertical and horizontally offset, so there is actual overlap of message parts.Then there are chronic ones. Safari's save or print to PDF are notorious for not saving pictures you can see, even from reading mode. How are basic functions in Safari not worth fixing, for years?Apple's HomePods ... for many years. I could write a blog of interesting Pod behavior.

Your patch is also very instructive on what you need me to do for you to make this more reasonable.I'm guessing that performance of this relative to xterm right now isn't... the best, mainly because the way you're grabbing the viewport seems expensive. I'm curious though if you did any benchmarks?One thing you probably really want to expose is the new RenderState API: https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/src/termina... You're doing per row line grabbing currently which is probably pretty slow. The RenderState API is stateful and produces the state necessary to create a high-performance, delta update renderer. It's what our production GPU renderers are now built on (but the API itself is compatible with any kind of renderer). It'd be better for you.After all that, I'm very curious even at this rudimentary level what the performance on various benchmarks look like compared to xterm.js.Excellent work!reply",

      "In my opinion, we're possessed by a cultural epidemic of think pieces doing rich and nuanced science history, but wrongly framed in the form of correcting \"myths\" that, in their substance amount to quibblings over narrative emphasis. It's easy to get taken in by the framing because it truly is enlightening, and the argument goes down so smooth because its embedded in a rich, curious, and fascinating scientific history that otherwise embodies best practices I would happily celebrate.But the key details about the story of penicillin are that a moldy plate showed bacteria-free clearing, Fleming saw it, isolated the mold, proved its germ-killing filtrate and published the finding, which is the heart of the story and which is not a myth.I'm sure it's true enough that St Mary's windows were usually kept shut to keep pathogens in and contaminants out, that London's August 1928 cold snap would have slowed staph growth, that Fleming's first notes Or 8 weeks later than the actual event, and that a modern plate seeded with bacteria first will not produce the celebrated halo unless the mold is given a head start. The article makes much of the fact that today\u2019s researchers cannot reproduce the famous halo if they add staph first, yet that difficulty rebuts a sequence Fleming never claimed to have used.These points are significant, even fascinating, yet the article inflates them into a strobe-lit \"MYTH\" banner, turning normal human imprecision about times and temperatures into evidence of wholesale fiction, which abuses the ordinary friction of any retrospective account and punishes the story for the very human messiness that makes it instructive.The window quibble, the incubator gap, and the replication protocol do not touch the central, uncontested fact that chance contamination plus observational curiosity gave medicine its first antibiotic.reply",
      "> The window quibble, the incubator gap, and the replication protocol do not touch the central, uncontested fact that chance contamination plus observational curiosity gave medicine its first antibiotic.Personally for me, while less important, I really appreciate the investigation into the narrative.I agree that the science is more important and the results don't care about the story.The balance is that we don't need to go around correcting everyone, but knowing more about the details of the story is worth my time in reading this piece. I think the article strikes the right tone.reply",
      "It's a myth in the most literal way. Fleming published and promoted his results despite a lack of reproducibility. By the time he won the Nobel Prize, he had backformed or misremembered a folksy story about an open window. That's textbook mythmaking.It can both be fine to have a glib story to tell schoolkids and important to recognize that the actual intellectual process is messier and more complex.reply",
      "> The window quibble, the incubator gap, and the replication protocol do not touch the central, uncontested fact that chance contamination plus observational curiosity gave medicine its first antibiotic.This is the same conclusion as the article. IMO, the importance of challenging the myth is that it has hisotrically taken precendence over your (and the article's) conclusion.FTA> Fleming\u2019s 1929 penicillin paper may have been written as a linear process, but that\u2019s almost certainly not how the discovery occurred. And by eliminating these complicated twists and turns, Fleming inadvertently obscured what may be one of the most important lessons in scientific history: how combining a meticulous research program with the openness to branch out into new directions led him to Nobel Prize-winning success. Neither rigid plans nor the winds of chance are enough on their own; discovery requires both.reply",
      "Definitely worded for clicks, but remember that \"myth\" doesn't mean \"false story\", it just means \"story\".reply",
      "Oh I really enjoyed this one.Got a quick insight about how penicillin works: interferes with cell-wall building which is a destroy and recreate process by preventing the recreate part.Got a quick view into the scientific process and communication: Fleming focused on the insight - penicillium kills staphylococcus - and left out the circuitous detail. This is important so that the big win here is very clear.And got an insight into human nature and memory: Fleming didn\u2019t tell the accidental contamination story until much later. It could possibly be even an idea someone else might have come up with which then took root in his mind (ironic haha!)The communication aspect reminds me of Mendel\u2019s far too perfect ratios for his pea plants. That kind of \u201crepeat till difference clear\u201d statistics would be decried today but perhaps that was to communicate rather than to determine.And finally, I really enjoy reading about human process innovation because I think it\u2019s a big factor in how Humanity grows. The lab notebook has to be some kind of star performer here - Fleming\u2019s notes allow us to look back like this.When I experiment with things, I naturally lean to keeping notes on my test protocol, observations, and results. But not because of some personal genius. It\u2019s just the standard way I was taught as a child in our science labs.I won\u2019t claim to the rigor of a microbiology lab but even just the process notes help a lot, which is useful since I\u2019m just testing molecules on myself.reply",
      "If you are not familiar with more of Mendel or plant biology, he got extremely lucky in picking a two chromosome species. The next plant he picked had more than two chromosome types so he spent the rest of his life hitting his head against the wall - obvious to us but him not having a theory and expertise with microscopes to explain his pea results hampered him greatly beyond his initial pea plant studies.reply",
      "What do you mean by a two chromosome species? A quick google says pea plants have 14 chromosomes. I only looked because I had never heard of a species only having two chromosomes. Do you mean the traits he was selecting for only had two alleles?reply",
      "The traits he picked- hope I get this detail pedantically correct: had only two alleles, each allele had an obvious phenotype controlled mostly by that gene, the two phenotypes were binary (no intermediate \"half-wrinkled-half-smooth\"). and all segregated independently (different chromosomes, or far enough that the linkage was extremely weak).  I remember my high school teacher speculating he inspected many different phenotypes and then reported his results on the final ones he picked where the results were nice.Unfortunately, most modern genotypes and phenotypes in humans don't follow these patterns, and over the years, genetics devloped an entire vocabulary and physical model to explain them, although at a fairly abstract level.  None of it made any sense to me so I follow the biophysics/molecular biology approach which tends to consider many more underlying physical detailsThere's a related story, https://review.ucsc.edu/spring04/bio-debate.html and https://review.ucsc.edu/spring04/twoversions.html which shows how different fields think about the genotype/phenotype relationship.

      "> Part of what made chrome succeed is it came out with a pretty robust set of webdev tools right from the get-go.I think this factor isn't given enough weight in the shift to Firefox.At that time, the largest pain point in web development was (by a long shot) browser compatibility.When developers fell in love with Firefox, they started pushing business requirements away from IE and towards the browser that didn't feel like it was their enemy. Alongside with this there was also massive shift to start taking web standards seriously, which is another area where IE dropped the ball spectacularlyIt took a few years, but eventually pointy haired managers got sick of our whining and gave in.reply",
      "We, no joke, ultimately were able to drop our support for IE6->8 because of the youtube \"we are dropping support for IE\" banner.  We spun it to our bosses as \"If google is doing this, we should be able to.\"reply",
      "Some time ago there was a post here about it. The guy claimed he and a few other fed up devs made that banner on their own initiative. The whole thing was a huge bluff because at the time google had no such plan but it gained so much momentum that they went ahead with it eventually.reply",

      "It's hard to state just how much of a game changer Firebug was for web development. Before that your only option was \"alert()\"ing or outputting directly to the page.Once Chrome came along with their devtools, improvements quickly escalated between the 2 before Google eventually won out.I can't recall the exact point in time when my use of Firefox fell off, but it was probably due to the account integrations with Chrome.reply",

None of their attempts to diversify their finances away from Google have panned out. They\u2019ve bought services and shuttered them, rebranded, and replaced their management team multiple times. Actions speak louder than words, and their actions belie a lack of direction and purpose.This is concerning for the health of the Web, given Mozilla write the only meaningful browser engine that competes with WebKit/Blink. But it also makes me sad on a personal level, because I was such a fan of their work, and a believer in the open Web and principles of choice and empowerment that they stood for. I wore the shirts, I spruiked them at events, I\u2019ve blogged about them for twenty years. Heck, I\u2019m one of the 5% of people on the Web who still uses Firefox as their daily driver, and still remembers the names Phoenix and Firebird.This is why takes like this one from Anil Dash feel\u2026 off, emphasis his:One of the top stor"
