      "Cool result, but worth highlighting two points:- Model is finetuned from Qwen-2.5 Instruct, which includes millions of specially filtered math examples in both pretraining and supervised fine-tuning already.- To generate the perfect 817 math examples for LIMO, they used state of the art models like R1 to filter down from an initial pool of 10 million math problems. In other words, a whole lot of intelligence was used to craft a maximally informative and distilled set of fine-tuning data. It\u2019s not very clear to me if this is more or less impressive than getting the same result by simply fine-tuning on the 10 million initial pool, but I suppose that would make for a worse headline.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, the authors explicitly highlighted those two points in the abstract, in terms of them being the elicitation threshold for complex reasoning, namely, an extremely complete pre-trained foundation model, and a set of extremely high quality examples post-training.To your question on finetuning on the initial 10 million pool - intuitively, it would require tremendous amount of finetuning data to move the needle - you really won't be able to move the gradients much with just 817 examples, that initial pool is effectively enforcing pretty rigid regularization.There is now an increasing interest in showing that small data with inference time scaling is providing significant yield. Couple of recent examples:* TinyZero: https://github.com/Jiayi-Pan/TinyZero\n* s1 Simple Test Time Scaling: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393\n \nreply",
      "The abstract doesn\u2019t specify that the 857 training examples were filtered down by R1 from 10 million initial questions.  This helps to understand the result better: it is in large part a testament to R1 and similar models\u2019 remarkable ability sift through and identify/construct perfect training data for other models.\n \nreply",
      "Why is everyone is so critical of using information from a previous model to make a more efficient model. There\u2019s nothing wrong with making progress using prior work. And increasing efficiency is progress.You wouldn\u2019t criticize someone\u2019s kombucha because they didn\u2019t piece their SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) together microbe by microbe.\n \nreply",
      "You are looking at it from a product perspective.\nFrom a scientific perspective, it just means the respective benchmark is meaningless, so we don't know how well such a model generalizes.\n \nreply",
      "Not so! From a scientific perspective the result you can achieve matters, no one is a blank slate.For humans this is true as well. The way you teach matters. Look at how the bell curve got absolutely demolished for example when math was taught this way:https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/20...\n \nreply",
      "There is a valid criticism that when you rely heavily on synthetic outputs, you bring along the precursor model's biases and assumptions without fully knowing the limitations of the data set the precursor model was trained on, as well as intentional adjustments made by the designers of the precursor model to favor certain geopolitical goals.But that's not the criticism that I'm often seeing; it's more that there's an \"unfair\" amount of press coverage towards new models that rely, in the critics' views, more on distillation than on \"true\" innovation.It's worth noting that there are many parties with significant motivation to build public sympathy that only \"true\" innovation should be valued, and it is only their highly-valued investments that can uniquely execute in that space. Cutting-edge models built in caves with a box of their scraps are counter to that narrative. It's worth considering https://paulgraham.com/submarine.html in this context, and understanding whether it is truly \"everyone\" that is critical in this way.\n \nreply",
      "Side note about this (great) PG article: its conclusion is that readers are leaving print media to come read online blogs because online content is \"more honest\" and less formulaic.After 2 years of widespread GPT slop at the top of search engine results, we've definitely come full circle.\n \nreply",
      "Having been an avid net user since the early 90s, I can\u2019t think of a time where that assertion wasn\u2019t specious. In 2005\u2014 the year Gmail debuted and people stated using the term \u201cweb 2.0\u201d\u2014 most of the content on the net was still from traditional media sources\u2014 PR garbage and all. Most blogs were still people just rattling off their opinions which was more likely based on the available content than their own high-quality research. And lack of oversight is a double-edged sword: sure you might have been less likely to get pure unfiltered marketing dreck but you were way more likely to get straight-up bullshit, which is a different, but serious problem.

      "LLMs that use Chain of Thought sequences have been demonstrated to misrepresent their own reasoning [1]. The CoT sequence is another dimension for hallucination.So, I would say that an LLM capable of explaining its reasoning doesn't guarantee that the reasoning is grounded in logic or some absolute ground truth.I do think it's interesting that LLMs demonstrate the same fallibility of low quality human experts (i.e. confident bullshitting), which is the whole point of the OP course.I love the goal of the course: get the audience thinking more critically, both about the output of LLMs and the content of the course. It's a humanities course, not a technical one.(Good) Humanities courses invite the students to question/argue the value and validity of course content itself. The point isn't to impart some absolute truth on the student - it's to set the student up to practice defining truth and communicating/arguing their definition to other people.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04388\n \nreply",
      "Yes!First, thank you for the link about CoT misrepresentation. I've written a fair bit about this on Bluesky etc but I don't think much if any of that made it into the course yet. We should add this to lesson 6, \"They're Not Doing That!\"Your point about humanities courses is just right and encapsulates what we are trying to do. If someone takes the course and engages in the dialectical process and decides we are much too skeptical, great! If they decide we aren't skeptical enough, also great. As we say in the instructor guide:\"We view this as a course in the humanities, because it is a course about what it means to be human in a world where LLMs are becoming ubiquitous, and it is a course about how to live and thrive in such a world. This is not a how-to course for using generative AI. It's a when-to course, and perhaps more importantly a why-not-to course.\"We think that the way to teach these lessons is through a dialectical approach.\"Students have a first-hand appreciation for the power of AI chatbots; they use them daily.\"Students also carry a lot of anxiety. Many students feel conflicted about using AI in their schoolwork. Their teachers have probably scolded them about doing so, or prohibited it entirely. Some students have an intuition that these machines don't have the integrity of human writers.\"Our aim is to provide a framework in which students can explore the benefits and the harms of ChatGPT and other LLM assistants. We want to help them grapple with the contradictions inherent in this new technology, and allow them to forge their own understanding of what it means to be a student, a thinker, and a scholar in a generative AI world.\"\n \nreply",
      "I'll give it a read. I must admit, the more I learn about the inner workings of LLM's the more I see them as simply the sum of their parts and nothing more. The rest is just anthropomorphism and marketing.\n \nreply",
      "Current LLMs are not the end-all of LLMs, and chain of thought frontier models are not the end-all of AI.I\u2019d be wary of confidently claiming what AI can and can\u2019t do, at the risk of looking foolish in a decade, or a year, or at the pace things are moving, even a month.\n \nreply",
      "That's entirely true. We've tried hard to stick with general principles that we don't think will readily be overturned. But doubtless we've been too assertive for some people's taste and doubtless we'll be wrong in places. Hence the choice to develop not a static book but rather living document that will evolve with time.

      "Honestly I think you need to divide \"Nix\" up into two:[1] a language interpreter and the build system/sandbox. First nix interprets the expressions. It does that in your local context - so that, if it's configured to, it might read your .aws/credentials file to get access to resources stored in your S3 bucket. Once it's established what it needs to build, then the build system takes over and sets up a sandbox and runs bash scripts and other commands to produce output. I had conflated the two for some time and it caused my a variety of confusions that are resolved by observing the distinction.(Also, I tend to think it's better to view NixOS as a tool for producing a linux distribution, which in many cases just happens to have an installbase of 1 - but that's not necessarily the case, and you could build your images with NixOS and deploy a dozen of them to aws.)[1]: this was meant to be a joke, but it occurs to me that a person might think I missed that they had divided \"Nix\" up into two, the buildsystem and the language. But a language is not a command and doesn't do anything, so it can't possibly be an interpreter as well - and there could be and to some degree is multiple nix interpreters. So it is the first of the divisions of Nix that I sliced in two, and you end up with three Nixes: the buildsystem/sandbox; the main language interpreter; and the language.\n \nreply",

      "Some of the mistakes/confusion being pointed out in the article is being replicated here, it seems.The article is not claiming that conditional branches are free. In fact, the article is not making any point about the performance cost of branching code, as far as I can tell.The article is pointing out that conditional logic in the form presented does not get compiled into conditionally branching code.\nAnd that people should not continue to propagate the harmful advice to cover up every conditional thing in sight[0].Finally, on actually branching code: that branching code is more complicated to execute is self-evident. There are no free branches. Avoiding branches is likely (within reason) to make any code run faster. Luckily[1], the original code was already branchless. As always, there is no universal metric to say whether optimisation is worthwhile.[0] the \"in sight\" is important -- there's no interest in the generated code, just in the source code not appearing to include conditional anythings.[1] No luck involved, of course ... (I assume people wrote to IQ to suggest apparently glaringly obvious (and wrong) improvements to their shader code, lol)\n \nreply",
      "I'm sure TFA's conclusion is right; but its argument would be strengthened by providing the codegen for both versions, instead of just the better version. Quote:\"The second wrong thing with the supposedly optimizer [sic] version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version [...] wasting two multiplications and one or two additions. [...] But don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the relevant part of the shader\"\u2014then proceeds to show only one codegen: the one containing no multiplications or additions.

      "Okay but how does this help the reader? If the worse code happens to optimize to the same thing it's still awful and you get no benefits. It's likely not to optimize down unless you have fast-math enabled because the extra float ops have to be preserved to be IEEE754 compliant\n \nreply",

      "Ha, not sure why it got submitted here now, but since I wrote the software, I'll provide some background:A couple of years ago we had a hand-fiddled table in our OpenStreetMap wiki with events, but discovery was poor and nobody really wanted to write wiki table syntax _shudder_ to add events. So people either didn't do it or only advertised their events in their group chats or Facebook groups.Thus I started writing some code, and now people can add an event by just logging in with their OpenStreetMap account and filling out a small form. We still display our events in a Wiki by using the API and a small Mediawiki plugin to maintain human compatibility for people who are used to getting events from the wiki. There are also RSS feeds, iCalendar subscriptions and event file downloads, so that everybody can subscribe to events in their preferred form.It's a small project that I've been running for a couple years and it's really rewarding to see people using it every day.\n \nreply",

But the formula x = 2^{log_2(m)}-m is a complicated way to say x=0. Did you mean that?When memory got bigger, I kept the literal dictionary in memory, but compressed it on secondary memory for fast transfer. The compression was trivial: store a suffix preceded by one byte that contained the length of the prefix that the word shared with its predecessor in dictionary order.We also added one byte per enry for affixing info, e.g. whether in- (or im- or ir-) is preferred over un-, whether a final consonant is doubled before adding a suffix that begins with a vowel, part of speech, etc. Although there were lots of such attributes, the number of distinct combinations of attributes that actually occurred was fewer than 256, so could be coded into one byte, and decoded by lookup in a 256-entry table. I automated the construction of that table, which would change if a dictionary revision created a new combination of attributes.With affixing info we could at the same time be more aggressive about affixing, and make fewer mistakes like allowing -s on a word that cannot be used as a noun or a verb.\n \nreply",

      "> The compression was trivial: store a suffix preceded by one byte that contained the length of the prefix that the word shared with its predecessor in dictionary orderThis is more or less what was speculated upon as compatible with his stemming ideas [1], but I (and partly McIlroy1982) doubt you ever really needed the fancy hashing-compression in the first place (though I'm sure it was fun to figure out!).  I got better perf (3x faster on a 5500 word document with an 82,000 word \"unabridged\" dictionary that prefix-compresses to only 278K which would fit on a 360K floppy of the era) than v7spell on v7 with just a merge algorithm somewhat more finely tuned against that format.  Of course, on a shared computer getting either the streaming disk access (without seeks spoiling the party) or all that RAM to yourself (without swapping spoiling the party) is a guess.

The end result is not the same as the status quo.The intent is not to make everyone richer, but to redistribute wealth in an equalizing direction. (In fact this might also make everyone slightly richer in real terms, because of second-order effects related to economies of scale that make it slightly easier to meet the growth in demand).Of course, the decreasing value of the dollar is an undesired side-effect of any government spending; this is why you counterbalance it with taxes to control price growth.

      "Almost all inland Celtic \u201ccities\u201d of western Europe were built around strong fortifiable positions, aka oppida. They were definitely well planned for defense against tribal warfare and tribal invasions. Aztec cities (probably all cities) had similar root motivations\u2014-control and defend territory.Bibracte near Autun in Burgundy \u2014 the city Julius Ceasar had to conquer \u2014 is built at the top of a 900 meter hill;Pyrene/Heuneburg built on a rocky spur overlooking the Danube in southern Germany is considered the first real city north of the Alps.Titelberg in Luxembourg was built on a site easily defended on three of four sides and with plenty of space at the top.One interesting exception\u2014-Milan (Mediolanum). Like ancient Mexico City its defenses consisted of water; tributaries to the Po and surrounding marshes.Venice is even more like Tenochtitlan and a more radical and more \u201cmodern\u201d version of Milan. The Venetia hit chased into their lagoon thanks to Attila and waves if Goths.You are right that Tenochtitlan had a much more obviously planned lurban structure. But the \u201corganics\u201d of Venice have their own logic, partly partly due to tides and winds but mainly due to a focus on commercial districts rather than religious/ceremonial districts.In 1500 both cities were very large: Tenochtitlan was close to 300,000 and Venice close to 200,000.\n \nreply",
      "Not to undermine what they did in any way but one thing the Mexica had that favored a strong grid with central planning was that each new bit of the city was built on land that had to be created from scratch. If you're going to build a new \"neighborhood\" from the lake, might as well make it rectangular. To some extent, they didn't even have to dig their canals, just leave bits of the lake not filled in (though there is more to making canals than just digging a ditch).Having said all that it certainly seems that ancient Meso-American city builders of all stripes were really into grid-tastic cities, at least for the monumental cores with the temples, ball courts etc.\n \nreply"
