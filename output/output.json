The largest regular event in the game is Cup of the Day (CotD), in which several thousand players are given fifteen minutes to learn a map and set the fastest time they can. Divisions are created based on the best times recorded by each player, with Division 1 hosting the fastest 64 players, Division 2 hosting the next fastest 64, and so on. Within each division, players race on the track for multiple rounds, and the slowest players each round get eliminated. The last man standing wins the division, and the winner of Division 1 wins that Cup of the Day."
