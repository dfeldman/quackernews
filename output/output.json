Linux is also free as in freedom, which may be very important for trusting the code you run, or which a governmental official runs.I bet that past the alpha stage they will offer a configuration tool to prepare the images to your liking, and ways to lock the system down even more. Would work nicely over PXE boot.reply",
      "It doesn't necessarily take much hackability away. You might find it makes it easier.You can overlay changes to the read-only rootfs using the sysext mechanism. You can load and unload these extensions. This makes experiments or juggling debug stuff a lot easier than mucking about in /usr used to be.A lot of KDE Linux is about making updates and even hackability safe in terms of making things trivial to roll back or remove. A goal is to always be able to unwedge without requiring a reinstall.If you know you can overlay whatever over your /usr and always easily return to a known-good state, hackability arguably increases by lowering the risk.reply",

      "I'm from Pontevedra. It has been the major's long-term project (~ 20 years) to make the city for the pedestrians: and he's done it. This works mainly because of two things: 1) the city is small and it takes aprox 30 min to walk it entirely from end to end, and 2) it is mostly flat. Only a smooth hill from \"orillamar\" to \"alameda/peregrina\". Unfortunately, the major obsessed with getting rid of cars (which I am highly grateful) but forgot to provide reliable public transport to close-by villages (max 5km,i.e., Poio/Marin/Salcedo). This means tha people from these villages commute by car to the city, which has really poor parking capacity. And the most important thing: there are zero specialized jobs in Pontevedra. Either you are a public state worker, for which you need to pass an exam to lock a lifelong job with no possibility of being fired regardless of how incompetent you are, or you work in hospitality. My partner works in Santiago and I work in the UK. There is no future for us in our city unless we want to study and compete for a position with thousands of other Spaniards. I firmly believe the major should also prioritise quality jobs. It is pretty nice for tourists to experience a city with no cars, but the reality of most locals is that they either leave or settle to accept precarious jobs.reply",
      "Thanks for the perspective. I think it's difficult for small cities like Pontevedra to create high quality jobs. There are not enough people to support rich doctors, lawyers, accountants and such. Factories can be established, but most people employed in a factory won't have a \"high-quality\" job. What other type of high-quality job could the city create?[1] population ~ 80k, but working population ~ 50k.reply",
      "There are a lot of places with crappy job markets and plenty of cars. I'm thinking of southern Italy for instance. At least they put the city on the map for something positive. Better than being just another anonymous place with poor job prospects and, who knows, maybe getting some attention helps with the economy.reply",
      "This is really amazing to see trending on HN. I spent a couple days in Pontevedra this summer while walking the Camino de Santiago. It was absolutely delightful and what I experienced aligns with the article. The old town was filled with wide streets almost exclusively for walking, cafes and restaurants that sprawled into plazas, and people young and old enjoying the car free public space. It was one of the first stops on our trip through Spain and as an American it was stunning.In America the contrast is stark. Most of our public spaces prioritize cars instead of people. I\u2019m lucky to live near the beltline in Atlanta. It\u2019s incredible to see how people flock to the beltline for a car free experience. It\u2019s such a rare thing in America. Where it exists you can see that there is tremendous demand for it. Supply on the other hand is unfortunately very difficult to deliver.reply",
      "I was in Spain last month and what stood out is that walkability requires mom and pop stores as well as more integrated neighborhoods with small commercial shops mixed into residential. Small shops seemed to be the majority in the city centers. The only large store I saw was a Lidl. They have largeish indoor markets that are more like a mini mall of individual shops like a butcher, produce, baker, cheese, even restaurants and bars. And these are located in a neighborhood center serving the surrounding community.The thing that kills walkability in the USA are the hyper scale stores and malls where everyone wants a mega store that has everything - one stop shops. They are too big to fit in small neighborhoods so they have to be built in a commercial district or large strip mall. And since they are big and house many shoppers at once they need big parking lots. Then they need big streets to feed those big parking lots. These big ass stores DEMAND cars and are very much a part of the problem.If you want more walkability then incentivize lots of small shops over single giant shops. I would also argue that neighborhoods that are all residential for blocks and blocks are another problem so zoning should force a minimal commercial allotment to ensure walkable neighborhoods.reply",
      "I think big box stores are popular largely because it would be inconvenient to drive between many smaller shops just to find the same variety of goods. It\u2019s the same dynamic we see with car-dependent shopping malls, where the main advantage is being able to park once and visit multiple stores. If instead you had to re-park at each individual store, the experience would be far less convenient.But if a town is designed to be fully walkable so that people can easily walk from store to store (similar to the experience of shopping inside a indoor mall), then I think the appeal of large one-stop-shop stores is greatly reduced.reply",
      "> But if a town is designed to be fully walkableThat is the point here. And do you always need to do all your shopping at once?If things were more walkable you can defer some shopping to other days.reply",
      "I would say that the causality goes in the other direction. We have big stores Carrefour and even some Coscos, but not in the middle of walkable cities.reply",
      "Mixed use zoning and some rules on what businesses can open would go a long way. Where I live I can walk to a small downtown that spans a few blocks with a train station. Unfortunately there is no where to buy groceries. There's like 3 ice cream shops, 3 pizza joints, and 9 salons though.reply",
      "Is there no demand for grocery stores? Seems like they naturally would pop up to fill demandreply"

      "Sabine Hossenfelder has been on about this topic in the field of physics publishing for quite some time now.It really is a terrible thing, though I can understand how some researchers feel trapped in a system that gives them little if any alternative if they wish to be employed the next year. Not just one thing needs to be changed to fix it.reply",
      "Things like citation brokers (paid to cite papers), abuse of power, paper mills, and blackmail (pg. 10) is appalling to me. I have to question how we ended up here. Academia seems very focused on results and output, and this is used as a metric to measure a researcher's worth or value.Has this always been an issue in academia, or is this an increasing or new phenomenon? It seems as if there is a widespread need to take shortcuts and boost your h-index. Is there a better way to determine the impact of research and to encourage researchers to not feel so pressed to output and boost their citations? Why is it like this today?Academic mathematics, from what I've seen, seems incredibly competitive and stressful (to be fair, so does competition math from a young age), perhaps because the only career for many mathematicians (outside a topics with applications such as but not limited to number theory, probability, and combinatorics) is academia. Does this play into what this article talks about?reply",
      "In my time in academia (~20 years) I have seen the demands and competition increase quite significantly, however talking to older researchers the this really started in the 90s the demands to demonstrate measurable outcomes increased dramatically and funding moved to be primarily through competitive grants (compared to significant base funding for researchers previously). The issue is that while previously it was common for academics to have funding for 1-2 PhD students to look into new research areas, now many researchers are required to bring in competitive grants for even covering part of their salary.What that means is that researchers become much more risk averse, and and stay in their research area even if they believe it is not the most interesting/imapactfull. You just can't afford to not publish for several years, to e.g.   investigate a novel research direction, because without the publications it becomes much much harder to secure funding in the future.reply",
      "This is interesting. Is there a reason why this started happening in the 90s?reply",
      "The issue in all fields became significantly worse as developing countries decided their universities needed to become world class and demanded more international publications for promotion. Look at the universities in the table in the paper and you can see which countries are clearly gaming the system. If your local bureaucrats can\u2019t tell which journals are good and which are fake, the fake journals become the most efficient strategy. Even worse, publishers figured out that if you can attract a few high-citation papers, your impact factor will go way up (it\u2019s an arithmetic mean) and your fake journal becomes \u201chigh quality\u201d according to the published citation metrics!Math is particularly susceptible to this because there are few legitimate publications and citation counts are low. If you are a medical researcher you can publish fake medical papers but more easily become \u201chigh impact\u201d on leaderboards (scaled by subject) by adding math topics to your subjects/keywords.reply",
      "> Has this always been an issue in academia, or is this an increasing or new phenomenon?The introduction of this article [1] gives an insight on the metric used in the Middle Ages. Essentially, to keep his position in a university, a researcher could win public debates by solving problems nobody else could solve. This led researchers to keep their work secret. Some researchers even got angry about having their work published, even with proper credit.[1]: https://www.jstor.org/stable/27956338reply",
      "Abuse of power is definitely not new. Professors have historically overworked their grad students and withheld support for their progress towards a PhD or a paper unless they get something out of it. For women it\u2019s extra bad because they can use their power in other ways.reply",
      "I've seen similar stuff in a couple of other places, including IT back in the 1990s (back when it wasn't nearly as glamorous as it is today).I think some of this has to do with... resentment? You're this incredibly smart person, you worked really hard, and no one values you. No one wants to pay you big bucks, no one outside a tiny group knows your name even if you make important contributions to the field. Meanwhile, all the dumb people are getting ahead. It's easy to get depressed, and equally easy to decide that if life is unfair, it's OK to cheat to win.Add to this the academic culture where, frankly, there are fewer incentives to address misbehavior and where many jobs are for life... and the nature of the field, which makes cheating is easy (as outlined in the article)... and you have an explosive mix.reply",
      "Are \"publication metrics\" also used heavily in China by the bureaucracy ?I know for a fact that the number of fake-journals exploded once the Govt. of India decided to use this for promotions.It's a bit sad really: in the classical world both these countries spent inordinate amount of time on the questions of epistemology (India esp.). Now reduced to mimicking some silly thing that vaguely tracks knowledge-production even in the best case in the West.reply",
      "TLDR: The publication culture of mathematics (with relatively few papers per researcher, few authors per paper, and few citations per paper) makes abuse of bibliometrics easier. The evidence suggests widespread abuse.My take: I\u2019ve published in well-regarded mathematical journals and the culture is definitely hard to explain to people outside of math. For example, it took more than two years to get my key graduate paper published in Foundations of Computational Mathematics, a highly regarded journal. The paper currently has over 100 citations, which (last I checked) is a couple times higher than the average citation count for the journal. In short, it\u2019s a great, impactful work for a graduate student. But in a field like cell biology, this would be considered a pretty weak showing.Given the long timelines and low citation counts, it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s so easy to manipulate the numbers. It is kinda ironic that mathematicians have this issue with numbers though.reply"

      "Fixing \"theoretical\" nondeterminism for a totally closed individual input-output pair doesn't solve the two \"practical\" nondeterminism problems, where the exact same input gives different results given different preceding context, and where a slightly transformed input doesn't give a correctly transformed result.Until those are addressed, closed-system nondeterminism doesn't really help except in cases where a lookup table would do just as well. You can't use \"correct\" unit tests or evaluation sets to prove anything about inputs you haven't tested.reply",
      "There is no such thing as \"exactly the same input, but with different preceding context\". The preceding context is input!If you were to obtain exactly the same output for a given input prompt, regardless of context, then that would mean that the context is being ignored, which is indistinguishable from the session not maintaining any context such that each prompt is in a brand new empty context.Now what some people want is requirements like:- The different wording of a prompt with exactly the same meaning should not change anything in the output; e.g. whether you say \"What is the capital of France\" or \"What is France's capital\" the answer should be verbatim identical.- Prior context should not change responses in ways that don't have any interaction with the context. For instance, a prompt is given \"what is 2 + 2\", then the answer should always be the same, except if the context instructs the LLM that 2 + 2 is to be five.These kinds of requirements betray a misunderstanding of what these LLMs are.reply",
      "I wonder if there's a way to use an LLM to rewrite the prompt, standardizing the wording when two prompts mean the same thing?reply",
      "It's going to backfire. In real scenarios (not regression testing) users don't want to see the exact same thing twice out of the LLM in the same session in spite of trying to refine the result with more context.There are going to be false positives: text that is subtly different from a previous response is misidentified as a duplicate such that the previous response is substituted for it, frustrating the user.reply",
      "Google search rewrites misspelled search queries and also lets you override it if that's not what you want. Maybe something similar would work?reply",
      "Not an expert, but I've been told RAG in combination with a database of facts is one way to get more consistency here. Using one of the previous examples, you might have a knowledge store (usually a vector database of some kind) that contains a mapping of countries to capitols and the LLM would query it whenever it had to come up with an answer rather than relying on whatever was baked into the base model.reply",

      "I tried longhorn on my homelab cluster. I'll admit it's possible that I did something wrong, but I managed to somehow get it into a state where it seemed my volumes got permanently corrupted. At the very least I couldn't figure out how to get my volumes working again.When restoring from backup I went with Rook (which is a wrapper on ceph) instead and it's been much more stable, even able to recover (albeit with some manual intervention needed) from a total node hardware failure.reply",
      "It is interesting seeing this article come up since just yesterday I setup longhorn in my homelab cluster needing better performance for some tasks than NFS was providing so I setup a raid on my r630 and tried it out.So far things are running well but I can't shake this fear that I am in for a rude awakening and I loose everything. I backups but the recovery will be painful if I have to do it.I will have to take a look at rook since I am not quite committed enough yet (only moved over 2 things) to switch.reply",
      "Longhorn is a poorly implemented distributed storage layer. You are better off with Ceph.reply",
      "have not used longhorn, but we are currently in the process of migrating off of ceph after an extremely painful relationship with it. Ceph has fundamental design flaws (like the way it handles subtree pinning) that, IMO, make more modern distributed filesystems very useful. SeaweedFS is also cool, and for high performance use cases, weka is expensive but good.reply",
      "That sounds more like a CephFS issue than a Ceph issue.(a lot of us distrust distributed 'POSIX-like' filesystems for good reasons)reply",
      "Are there any distributed POSIX filesystems which don\u2019t suck? I think part of the issue is that POSIX compliant filesystem just doesn\u2019t scale, and you are just seeing that?reply",
      "weka seems to Just Work from our tests so far, even under pretty extreme load with hundreds of mounts on different machines, lots of small files, etc... Unfortunately it's ungodly expensive.reply",
      "I've heard Ceph is expensive to run. But maybe that's not true?reply",
      "Ceph overheads aren't that large for a small cluster, but they grow as you add more hosts, drives, and more storage. Probably the main gotcha is that you're (ideally) writing your data three times on different machines, which is going to lead to a large overhead compared with local storage.Most resource requirements for Ceph assume you're going for a decently sized cluster, not something homelab sized.reply",
      "I'm only just wading in, after years of intent. I don't feel like Ceph is particularly demanding. It does want a decent amount of ram. 1GB each for monitor, manager, and metadata, up to 16GB total for larger clusters, according to docs. But then each disk's OSD defaults to 4gb, which can add up fast!! And some users can use more. 10Gbe is recommended and more is better here but that seems not unique to ceph: syncing storage will want bandwidth. https://docs.ceph.com/en/octopus/start/hardware-recommendati...reply"

    "first_paragraph": "Vegards Nerderier og andre innleggThe other day, I took a look at Longhorn again. I briefly looked at it earlier, as a way to get volumes that are writeable from more than one node. I tossed it away then, because I mistook it for nothing more than a glorified NFS server. I was quite wrong.At the time of writing, I already know I\u2019m going to make fundamental changes, I will not run with a 2-node cluster permanently, because the latency I have isn\u2019t necessarily a good idea. However, longhorn will play a vital play in my DR strategy.I wanted to play with longhorn in a multi-node cluster before going there, though, because when I create my proper DR strategy, my 2nd node will be occupied with being a cluster in its own.Longhorn in a way has many similarities with ZFS, but made for a distributed environment like Kubernetes. In a nutshell, Longhorn provision block devices out of a pool \u2013 or several, I have an SSD pool and a HDD pool. You\u2019ll create storage classes using those pools, with the p"

What's the name of the rule where everyone with a sufficiently large codebase has a partially implemented, buggy time oriented data log somewhere and it's too bad people didn't realize that sooner.

      "I just use a git repo and GNU Stow similar to the approach in this post (I'm not the author of the post):https://tamerlan.dev/how-i-manage-my-dotfiles-using-gnu-stow...Stow is usually trivially installable using the package manager while I'm installing git. Not nearly as full featured as chezmoi but gets the job done for me.reply",
      "I've seen projects like this for years and I still have the genuinely honest question: what are people doing that managing their dotfiles is significant problem for them?I've managed my dotfiles (12 different configuration files all compatible with cygwin, wsl, linux, macOS) for the past decade in a git repo with a 50 LOC shell script that creates symlinks for me in an intelligent way. What am I missing?reply",
      "If that works for you, great. I split files up into multiple repos and manage them with VCSH. The modular approach lets me configure multiple machines differently. I have config on my work laptop that shouldn\u2019t end up on my personal devices, vice versa. I don\u2019t really need my i3 config on my MacBook Pro. Ditto for XDG paths, just as I have macOS config that doesn\u2019t have a natural fit on a Linux desktop.I could use one repo for work and one for personal and live with the mess of useless files, but I like the cleanliness and having simple git histories. I also don\u2019t have to have conditional statements all over the place.reply",
      "I use chezmoi, and I didn\u2019t have to write a 50-line script - just install chezmoi on a new machine, run a command pointing it to a git repo, and up pop all the dot files and configs I need to have a consistent environment everywhere.Chezmoi also handles variations in config files for personal vs. Work machines, or even differences between machines themselves.I agree it\u2019s not a tremendous lift to write a bespoke solution for this (and I did so in the past) but at some point it becomes lower-effort to use something off the shelf.reply",
      "In addition to that, chezmoi templating can be used to fill in environment variables like secret keys, you just need to unlock rbw or whatever other password manager it is that you use.\nI have some that I export in my shell config, and this setup allows me to have the repo in a public place and not worry about who finds it.reply",
      "I use home-manager for my dotfiles, and they manage quite a few things.For example:1. My editor config (neovim) including downloading and installing all my plugins, including the dependencies of the plugins (including deno, rust-analyzer, clippy, etc)2. All the other tools I use, like ripgrep, python, and so on, including installing the same version on every machine I've got.3. A bunch of misc programs and scripts I've written for myself, including all their dependencies4. All the xdg configuration to open http links in the right browser profile, pdfs in evince, etc, as well as all the programs needed for that5. systemd user units to run various daemons, like syncthing to sync some documents between computers, gpg-agent, etc etc.And this works on all machines running any linux distro, from arch linux to nixos to ubuntu.home-manager is just another dotfile manager, but since nix makes packages isolated, such that my user version of $pkg doesn't conflict or depend on the host version, home-manaer can also safely manage applications I run, like my editor, browser, developer tools, systemd units, etc etc etc.I agree that most dotfile managers are weird overengineered projects that could have been a short shell script.I think nix+home-manager is a weird overengineered project that could not have been a shell script.reply",
      "Why is \"written in Rust\" as important as what the software is about? I noticed this tendency of specifying when something is written in Rust.Should it be an indicator of better stability? Or performance? And if so, am I interested in the performance of a dotfile tool?Genuinely curious.reply",
      "Easy to deploy, usually single static binaries.  Same goes with Golang projects.  Polar opposite of java (which I'll totally ignore).reply",
      "Very funny to me that Java's initial appeal: it's easy to deploy \"everywhere\"; is now it's disadvantage (you need a whole Java setup with JAVA_HOME and God knows what else).Now the bar for GUI apps is cross-compilation to deployable web, Windows, Linux (Electron), Android, iOS (? I don't know I don't use/develop for Apple products) versions from running a simple command.And for the CLI world, well, almost everyone is on Linux x86-64, or maybe arm, so a few static binaries (or \"virtually\" static -- depending only on glibc) are king for deployment.reply",

      "As I work more with AI, I\u2019ve came to the conclusion that I have no patience to read AI-generated content, whether the content is right or wrong. I just feel like it\u2019s time wasted. Countless of examples: meeting summaries (nobody reads them), auto generated code (we usually do it for prototypes and pocs, if it works, we ship it, no reviews. For serious stuff we take care of the code carefully), and a large etc.I like AI on the producing side. Not so much on the consuming side.reply",
      "For me, AI meeting summaries are pretty useful. The only way I see they're not useful for you is that you're disciplined enough to write down a plan based on the meeting subject.reply",
      "I tend to agree. Except if it's text generated by me for me.I don't want you to send me a AI-generated summary of anything, but if I initiated it looking for answers, then it's much more helpful.reply",
      "I'm not doing this much now, but this AI-generated text might be more useful if you use AI to ask questions using it as a source.reply",
      "That's fair! If there were a \"minimal\" mode where you could still access callers, data flows, and dependencies with no AI text, would it be helpful for your reviews?reply",
      "Not parent, but in my opinion the answer here is yes. I agree that there is a real need here and a potentially solid value proposition (which is not the case with a lot of vscode-fork+LLM-based starups) but the whole point should be to combat the verbosity and featurelessness of LLM-generated code and text. Using an LLM on the backend to discover meaningful connections in the codebase may sometimes be the right call but the output of that analysis should be some simple visual indication of control flow or dependency like you mention. At a first look the output in the editor looks more like an expansion rather than a distillation.Unrelated, but I don't know why I expected the website and editor theme to be hay-yellow and or hay-yellow and black instead of the classic purple on black :)reply",
      "Thanks for the opinion! That makes a lot of sense and I like the concept of being an extension of a user's own analysis vs hosing them with information.Yeah originally I thought of using yellow/brown or yellow/black but for some reason I didn't like the color. Plenty of time to go back though!reply",
      "honestly i feel the same way and i can't quite put into words why. I guess if I had to -- I think it's because I know not all AI generated stuff is equally created and that some people are terrible at prompting/or don't even proofread the stuff that's outputted, so I have this internal barometer that screams \"you're likely wasting your time reading this\" and so I just learned to avoid it entirely. Which is sad, because clearly now a ton of stuff is AI generated, so I barely read anything, _especially_ if I see any signals like \"it's not just this, it's that\"reply",
      "It could be just fatigue over the technology itself, but \u201clike you wrote them yourself\u201d sounds too much like a dog whistle for a user base of programmers working with AI generated PRs. Which means that this would be AI iterating over AI.Feedback: Try speeding up your demo animations and resize the mouse to its regular size. My estimate is that if the marketing copy explains what a thing is, what it does and why it\u2019s useful then all a visitor wants to see in an image is things go pop, boom and whoosh.reply",
      "Products like these make me realize we're solving for the wrong problems with a lot of these AI solutions. I don't want you to take this as a hit to you or your product, I actually think it's extremely cool and will likely find a use. But from my perspective if this is a product you think you need, then you likely have a bigger organizational issue, as PRs are probably the last thing that I would want an AI 'intern' to organize for me.reply"
