      "I've been using cursor since it launched, sticking almost exclusively to claude-3.5-sonnet because it is incredibly consistent, and rarely loses the plot.As subsequent models have been released, most of which claim to be better at coding, I've switched cursor to it to give them a try.o1, o1-pro, deepseek-r1, and the now o3-mini. All of these models suffer from the exact same \"adhd.\" As an example, in a NextJS app, if I do a composer prompt like \"on page.tsx [15 LOC], using shadcn components wherever possible, update this page to have a better visual hierarchy.\"sonnet nails it almost perfectly every time, but suffers from some date cutoff issues like thinking that shadcn-ui@latest is the repo name.Every single other model, doesn't matter which, does the following: it starts writing (from scratch), radix-ui components. I will interrupt it and say \"DO NOT use radix-ui, use shadcn!\" -- it will respond with \"ok!\" then begin writing its own components from scratch, again not using shadcn.This is still problematic with o3-mini.I can't believe it's the models. It must be the instruction-set that cursor is giving it behind the scenes, right? No amount of .cursorrules, or other instruction, seems to get cursor \"locked in\" the way sonnet just seems to be naturally.It sucks being stuck on the (now ancient) sonnet, but inexplicably, it remains the only viable coding option for me.Has anyone found a workaround?\n \nreply",
      "My experience with cursor and sonnet is that it is relatively good at first tries, but completely misses the plot during corrections.\"My attempt at solving the problem contains a test that fails? No problem, let me mock the function I'm testing, so that, rather than actually run, it returns the expected value!\"It keeps doing that kind of shenanigans, applying modifications that solve the newly appearing problem while screwing the original attempt's goal.I usually get much better results from regular chatgpt copying and pasting, the trouble being that it is a major pain to handle the context window manually by pasting relevant info and reminding what I think is being forgotten.\n \nreply",
      "Can't you select Chatgpt as the model in cursor?\n \nreply",
      "Yes, but for some reason it seems to perform worse there.Perhaps whatever algorithms Cursor uses to prepare the context it feeds the model are a good fit for Claude but not so much for the others (?). It's a random guess, but whatever the reason, there's a weird worsening of performance vs pure chat.\n \nreply",
      "Yes it\u2019s usually worth it to try to write a really good first prompt\n \nreply",
      "Context length possibly. Prompt adherence drops off with context, and anything above 20k tokens is pushing it. I get the best results by presenting the smallest amount of context possible, including removing comments and main methods and functions that it doesn't need to see. It's a bit more work (not that much if you have a script that does it for you), but the results are worth it. You could test in the chatgpt app (or lmarena direct chat) where you ask the same question but with minimal hand curated context, and see if it makes the same mistake.\n \nreply",
      "If it's a context issue, it's an issue with how cursor itself sends the context to these reasoning LLMs.Context alone shouldn't be the reason that sonnet succeeds consistently, but others (some which have even bigger context windows) fail.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, that's what I'm suggesting. Cursor is spamming the models with too much context, which harms reasoning models more than it harms non-reasoning models (hypothesis, but one that aligns with my experience). That's why I recommended testing reasoning models outside of Cursor with a hand curated context.The advertised context length being longer doesn't necessarily map 1:1 with the actual ability for the model to perform difficult tasks over that full context. See for example the plots of performance on ARC vs context length for o-series models.\n \nreply",
      "We've been working on solving a lot of these issues with v0.dev (disclaimer: shadcn and I work on it). We do a lot of pre and post-processing to ensure LLMs output valid shadcn code.We're also talking to the cursor/windsurf/zed folks on how we can improve Next.js and shadcn in the editors (maybe something like llms.txt?)\n \nreply",

      "While I use LLMs I form and discard mental models for how they work. I've read about how they work, but I'm looking for a feeling that I can't really get by reading, I have to do my own little exploration.  My current (surely flawed) model has to do with the distinction between topology and geometry.  A human mind has a better grasp of topology, if you tell them to draw a single triangle on the surfaces of two spheres they'll quickly object.  But an LLM lacks that topological sense, so they'll just try really hard without acknowledging the impossibility of the task.One thing I like about this one is that it's consistent with the Waluigi effect (which I just learned of).  The LLM is a thing of directions and distances, of vectors.  If you shape the space to make a certain vector especially likely, then you've also shaped that space to make its additive inverse likely as well.  To get away from it we're going to have to abandon vector spaces for something more exotic.\n \nreply",
      "> A high level description of the effect is: \"After you train an LLM to satisfy a desirable property P, then it's easier to elicit the chatbot into satisfying the exact opposite of property P.\"The idea is that as you train a model to present a more sane/complient/friendly persona, you can get it to simulate an insane/noncomplient/unfriendly alternate persona that reflects the opposite of how its been trained to behave.\n \nreply",

In the null pointer case, it makes sense for kernel-mode code to potentially indirect to address 0 (or 0xffffffff, or whatever your architecture designates as null), while user-space code can be reasonably considered never to legitimately access that address because the virtual memory never maps it as a valid address.

      "I think Computer Architecture can be designed around legacy but fun hardwares.So instead of using some fantasy machines such as LC-3, students can directly get into the world of 6502.First semester: mostly concentrated on 6502 with a full 6502 CPU emulator as the final project.Second semester: concentrate on a real machine such as the NES. Students need to learn to improve their emulators to program in it (so, do you need a debugger? a decompiler?), as well as hacking roms, burning roms, using carts to load the games into a real NES, and programming new games for it. The game must run in the emulator as well as a real NES.Third semester for honour: upgrade to a 16/24/32-bit machine, e.g. 80286, SNES, 68K, whatever, and get some serious project done. Can use C if applicable. The project can even be a simple OS or a BASIC interpreter to pave the way for advanced classes. Or maybe a computer virus, anything that is fun and creative.OS and compiler classes can also be designed around real hardware and projects. e.g. Porting an early version of Linux to a once popular architecture and add a few small functionalities; Write a compiler for a LISP-like language for that architecture and OS.You don't even need Data Structure and Algorithm and those BS Java programming classes - they learn them on the way.

Interestingly, Mistral just updated their small model yesterday with a big reduction in layers in order to improve performance. Among the many ways they say it more technically they do say directly \"depth plays\na more critical role than width in reasoning and composition tasks\".2. As I understand it, they are claiming to be able to prove mathematically that Chain of Thought such as seen in the new DeepSeek R1 and GPT o1/o3 models creates results that wouldn't be possible without it. The thought chains effectively act as additional layers, and per the previous point, the more layers the better. \"From a theoretical view, CoT provides Transformer with extra computation space, and previous work\n... proved that log-precision Transformer with CoT could simulate any polynomial-time algorithm. Therefore, by further assuming certain complexity conjecture ...  their results imply that constant depth Transformer with CoT could simulate\npoly-time algorithm, while constant depth Transform ... itself can not solve P-complete task.\"\n \nreply",

      "There was an update in November 2013 at the end of https://www.nablaman.com/relay/story.php> The last time I wrote something here was two and a half years ago. Since then, Zusie has been more or less finished. Also, I've moved to a different city, and Zusie has followed along.\n \nreply",
      "I think that's the fate of every project like that. Not to take away from it, it's still fantastic and geeky. But at some point, you have this realization that you're pouring years of your life into something that is not only utterly useless, but also won't be appreciated by others. You can't even play Pong on it. There's literally nothing you can demo to non-nerds, other than \"this device makes looks complicated and makes noise\".Maybe you'll make it to HN more than a decade later, but that's it. No one will buy it from you. Your heirs will toss it out. It... sucks.\n \nreply",
      "Who's to say no one appreciates it? And even if it were unappreciated, that doesn't make it any less worthwhile to the person working on it if that's what they choose to do with their time. Not every project needs to live forever with a bustling community and updates. You can quietly work on something, finish it one day, be proud of your work, and put it online for others to admire (or not). That's plenty enough of a purpose and reason to build these things IMO.\n \nreply",

      "And yet you've developed this knowledge for yourself that applies to other things. Among them you develop probably the most imperative skill which practically nobody focuses on; problem solving. And if you've got kids that share your interests they get that knowledge and experience also.Humans need hobbies. Humans need to explore their curiosities. If you're not doing this you're hiking or biking or gaming or going to the gym or kayaking or.... something equally useless.\n \nreply",
      "I really feel this statement. I'm being forced out of a company that is struggling to pay my salary, after almost 18 years. This is a career where I taught myself and continued (and continue) to improve. I know that my best skill is the ability to solve unique problems, and that's mostly been from needing to complete a project or the business loses their time and money. For most of my career, I have been the sole developer, and impostor syndrome is real and haunting. Having HN, and following various news and blog sources, I think I am in a good place with my knowledge. It's just transferring to another company after almost two decades that is the scary part.Having a senior position, but still very much wanting to be involved in coding and architecture, makes me nervous that I won't be able to keep my same lifestyle without going into full-time management. Problem solving is often tossed to the side for a \"good enough\" answer. I understand that as a business need, but when things start to get really complicated, pulling in an existing library or solution is often not possible.\n \nreply",
      "Sure, but we're herd animals and also need validation, even if we're pretending not to. We go on a journey of self-discovery to Nepal so that we can talk to others how profound it was, etc.I'm not dissing hobbies, I'm just saying that building stuff like that is a very lonely hobby, which is why such projects almost always fizzle out.\n \nreply",
      "I 3D printed some Zuse-style mechanical NAND gates last year, that was a lot of fun and makes for a great fidget toy:https://mero.ng/i/vMdqQYJG.jpgI've kind of given some thought of doing a higher-quality metal production run of these with nice finish and engravings of the inputs and outputs as a geeky desk fidget.Model credit goes here (and of course to the original Zuse patent application the design is from), although I made a NAND remix as I wanted a universal gate and fixed up all of the tolerances and still really have to upload my version:https://www.printables.com/model/69642-zuse-inspired-z1-logi...\n \nreply",

    "first_paragraph": "I amuse myself by constructing a computer almost entirely out of relays.\nRelays were used to construct computers well before vacuum tubes, transistors or integrated circuits were feasible for the task. The main inspiration is the machines by Konrad Zuse of the late 30s and early 40s.Why relays? In addition to constituting an important historical link between the mechanical and electronic\ncomputers, relays are especially fun to work with since they\n\nare big and slow, with huge propagation delays and a tendency to oscillate if you hook them up wrong.\nare noisy, especially when lots of relays switch at the same time.\nconsume lots of power to do even the simplest of calculations.\nsubscribe to Lenz' law, i.e. generate lots of EMF and flyback current that make for all sorts of interesting\ninterference in places you couldn't even guess.\n\nSo all in all, relays require you to think in very new ways compared to normal solid-state devices.Quick feature list:To build a relay computer, you clearly "
