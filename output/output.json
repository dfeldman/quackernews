      "One thing nobody remembers (or at least never writes about in these retrospectives) from the early days of Geocities is you literally had to virtually \"walk\" up and down \"blocks\" in the the \"neighborhoods\" to find a \"vacant lot\" to put your site in. When I initially tried to sign up, they had some beta of a \"vacant lot finder\" cgi form that didn't work.I ended up going to some other service (it may have been Tripod?) to host my page before we switched ISPs to one that gave you 2 MB of space.As far as I can tell the \"blocks\" were never archived so they're missing from the internet archive.

      "I can appreciate the pain points you guys are addressing.The \"diagonal scaling\" approach seems particularly clever - dynamically choosing between horizontal and vertical scaling based on the query characteristics rather than forcing users into a one-size-fits-all model. Most real-world data workloads have mixed requirements, so this flexibility could be a major advantage.I'm curious how the new streaming engine with out-of-core processing will compare to Dask, which has been in this space for a while but hasn't quite achieved the adoption of pandas/PySpark despite its strengths.The unified API approach also tackles a real issue. The cognitive overhead of switching between pandas for local work and PySpark for distributed work is higher than most people acknowledge. Having a consistent mental model regardless of scale would be a productivity boost.Anyway, I would love to apply for the early access and try it out. I'd be particularly interested in seeing benchmark comparisons against Ray, Dask, and Spark for different workload profiles. Also curious about the pricing model and the cold start problem that plagues many distributed systems.\n \nreply",

      "Every time I build something complex with dataframes in either R or Python (Pandas, I haven't used Polars yet), I end up really wishing I could have statically typed dataframes. I miss the security of knowing that when I change common code, the compiler will catch if I break a totally different part of the dashboard for instance.I'm aware of Pandera[1] which has support for Polars as well but, while nice, it doesn't cause the code to fail to compile, it only fails at runtime. To me this is the achilles heel of analysis in both Python and R.Does anybody have ideas on how this situation could be improved?[1] https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n \nreply",
      "The pandas mypy stubs attempt to address this to some extent, but to be honest.. It's really painful. Not helped by pandas' hodgepodge API design to be fair, but i think even a perfect API would still be annoying to statically type. Imagine needing to annotate every function that takes a data frame with 20 columns...A tantalising idea i have not explored, is to try and hook up polars' lazy query planner to a static typing plugin. The planner already has basically complete knowledge of the schema at every point, right?So in theory this could be used to give the really good inference abilities that a static typing system needs to be nice to use.\n \nreply",

Python/pandas feels Stone Age in comparison - you absolutely waste a lot of time iterating with run-time testing.\n \nreply",
      "I agree, and I suspect there are large numbers of unknown bugs in a lot of data frame based applications.But to do it right you'd need a pretty good type system because these applications implicitly use a lot of isomorphisms between different mathematical objects. The current solution is just to ignore types and treat everything as a bag of floats with some shape. If you start tracking types you need a way to handle these isomorphisms.\n \nreply",
      "This is really cool, not sure how I missed it. I assume catalog support will be added fairly quickly. But ironically I think the biggest barrier to adoption will be the lack of an off-ramp to a FOSS solution that companies can self-host. Obviously Polars itself is FOSS, but it understandably seems like there's no way to self-host a backend to point a `pc.ComputeContext` to. That will be an especially tough selling point for companies that are already on Spark. I wonder how much they'll focus on startups vs. trying to get bigger companies to switch, and whether they'll try a Spark compatibility layer like DataFusion (https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet).\n \nreply"

It could run embedded, on a client server model, or on full OLAP data warehouses.Whereas for dataframes, the API was different per use case and performance was drastically lacking behind SQL solutions. Locally, pandas was dominant, and remotely/distributed, it was PySpark. For end-users, pandas was very easy to get up and running, but it seems to have ignored what databases have learned over decades, there was no query optimization, poor data type implementation, many needless materializations, it offloaded memory handling to NumPy, and a few other design decisions that led to poor scaling and inconsistent behavior. PySpark was much closer to databases, it follows the relational model, has optimization, a distributed query engine and scaled properly.

I chose to summarise them in this section to give you a brief overview of what I would like to focus on.Perhaps most importantly, Rust has a powerful trait system that easily generalises dynamic and static dispatch and an ownership model which enforces certain memory-safety-centric invariants. Just to demonstrate a fraction of Rust\u2019s ergonomic design, we will observe this by considering the following example that compares static (i.e. compile-time polymorphism using templates) and dynamic (i.e. runtime polymorphism using virtual functions) dispatch in C++:This approach is fast, as the compiler can trace and inline the function calls.

      "You are likely aware of the English language's feature of multiple adjectives (that are modifying the same noun) needing to appear in a certain order to sound \"correct\". So for example \"yellow big balloon\" sounds wrong but \"big yellow balloon\" sounds right. This is because SIZE is supposed to come before COLOR in standard English phrases.In this case, \"robotic\" and \"private\" could be similar enough in category to be confusing. In the Order of Adjectives[0], \"robotic\" is in the TYPE category, near the bottom of the list, and \"private\" seems to fit in that same category at first glance. By that interpretation, either \"robotic private\" or \"private robotic\" works.What if instead of \"private\" it said \"Californian\"? That would make it an ORIGIN, and \"Californian robotic spacecraft\" becomes the obvious choice \u2014 otherwise, you'd think they were talking about a spacecraft belonging to robots from California. ;)So if we interpret \"private\" as an ORIGIN, your \"private robotic spacecraft\" sounds better.

I realize (with dread) that the game is about 17 years old now, but I eagerly awaited it release back in the day, and it was one of first games that I still think of as \"modern\".

      "It\u2019s a weird in between, IMO. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not emulation, because in most places the original architecture\u2019s state is maintained through macros like PPC_FUNC - the original source code is not fully ported to the host platform, but relies on a set of compile and runtime tricks which, well, emulate the properties of the guest.

      "Great article.A couple weeks ago, on a flight, I watched the movie Conclave (2024) which is about the process of selecting the Pope, in a modern context. I thought it was surprisingly good, but felt like a warning call for the next papal conclave as it illustrated how the power some of these individuals face can corrupt. Fascinating to think how this process would have played out in 16th Century Italy.\n \nreply",
      "What makes you think that movie is an accurate representation of the papal selection process? I watched it too and while the videography is amazing, the plot of the movie is clearly dictated by having an agenda rather than accurately trying to portray reality.\n \nreply",
      "I saw the movie recently as well.It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve encountered any information about how a new pope is selected. Period.As a not-dumb person, I realize it\u2019s just a movie. But the basic premise of being cordoned off from the outside world, voting until someone is chosen, with the voting going on for days and signaled through smoke by burning the ballets - I assume that basic premise is at least mostly accurate?Edit:  Indeed, after some basic googling, the premise of the movie seems to line up with the basic premise of how a pope was selected centuries ago.\n \nreply",
      "What sort of agenda did you think the movie had? I suppose there's a slight humanist agenda, since it portrays nearly all the characters pursuing goals that probably aren't considered the ideal religious goals.\n \nreply",
      "Those who say film doesn't influence popular attitudes underestimate how many people treat film as a source of knowledge. Horrifying to realize.\n \nreply",
      "All sorts of works of fiction have been sources of knowledge for much longer than film has been around. Aesop's fables and parables in the Bible are intentful examples. I don't find this horrifying.\n \nreply",
      "You should check out the voting process for electing the Doge of Venice:https://www.theballotboy.com/electing-the-doge\n \nreply",
      "There\u2019s some fairly deep statistical analysis out there on the Doge voting. To my memory it was only subverted once, leading to some changes. The analysis I remember concludes they have like one more round than needed to meet goals of the voting in terms of fairness, representation and difficulty of capture. Anyway, it\u2019s a very interesting bit of voting history that lasted a long time.\n \nreply",
      "This is a crazy process.  \nAlthough I feel like I am a bit confused.When they say \u201creduced by lot\u201d then mean by a lottery? By that same original boy or something else?They also talked about needing approval from electors, I assume that was from the previous small pool.  Can\u2019t exactly determine who they mean.\n \nreply",
      "Best not to overthink think. It\u2019s the best random number generator they thought they had. Even ours suck.They just wanted a member of the Aristocrat to be in charge is the point. An inauguration validated with whatever appears like merit (but the whole thing is rigged since only one type can ever win - the aristocrat (the entire pool is aristocrats)).Self selected group :)Have fun with Doge.\n \nreply"
