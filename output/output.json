      "I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be so pro Waymo but anecdotally I had a fantastic experience with one recently.I was at a music show very late ~1-2am in SF and walked out to grab an uber to the airbnb I was staying at. I kept getting assigned an uber, then I\u2019d wait 10 minutes, then they\u2019d cancel. Rinse and repeat for 30 minutes, mind you I even resorted to calling Lyfts at the same time and nothing bit. Then I say screw it and download Waymo. 1 minute and it\u2019s accepted my ride, and I know it\u2019s not going to cancel because it\u2019s a robot. 3 minutes and it picks me up. The car is clean, quiet, I can play my own music in it via Spotify, and it\u2019s driving honestly more safely than some uber drivers I\u2019ve had in SF. It\u2019s one of the few things where the end result actually lives up to the promise from a tech company.reply",
      ">  then I\u2019d wait 10 minutes, then they\u2019d cancel. Rinse and repeat for 30 minutes,This is such a common problem in SF (esp in odd times / from the airport). Waymo has been a lifesaver in these situations.reply",
      "Used to happen to me constantly trying to go across the bay bridge in either direction when I lived in Oakland. I didn\u2019t even mind the cancelations so much but the worst was when they would try and hide around the block, close enough to say they\u2019ve \u201carrived\u201d to try to get me marked as a no show and pocket the fee.reply",
      "They have a cancellation rate metric on their end that they are trying to avoid.I have similar problems when I dated someone across the bridge.They also lose a ton of money leaving SF at prime time / etc.reply",
      "I once got stuck at the vista point at the north end of Golden Gate, because it turns out it's nearly impossible to approach from the Marin side even though that's closer. So like ~4 drivers in a row tried, got lost on the way and canceled.reply",
      "I don't know what it is but in basically every major airport I have struggled to get an uber/lyft. I expect at minimum one cancellation...reply",
      "In many cities this is solved with the \"Uber rank\" system, where you simply get in the first car in line, give the driver a code, and then it loads up your journey. Fast and avoids any hassles with drivers rejecting your destination.reply",
      "Same. I assume it depends on the destinationPerson wants to go somewhat far from airport? That's more time on this single ride and less time pocketing peak demand moneyreply",
      "Curious why didn't you try Waymo until then? Was it just that it never had a reason to, or was something holding you back?From my experience, lot of people actively seek out Waymo if it is available.reply",
      "I took one in SF on a rainy, dark night when I was visiting a year ago. I was pretty impressed. That's not an easy city to navigate even on a sunny day and it did fine.reply"

      "No, one study doesn\u2019t upend the last few decades of understanding of emotional attachment.The study simply says that ability to connect w friends is more predictive than observations they made of apparent attachment of parents.This happens much later so of course it\u2019s more predictive of the actual end effects - that\u2019s when attachment styles actually show up for the first time. Kids grow up to be very adaptive toward their parents but when they get to the rest of society that\u2019s when the failures of connection and the failed bids for attention show up.A very resilient kid will do fine with friends even with a very bad attachment environment. A very sensitive kid or one with developmental problems will struggle in social environments.reply",
      "Also, even the proposed effect is modest:> But early friendship bonds played an even bigger part than maternal relationships in the ways people navigated adult friendships and romantic partnerships, accounting for 4 percent of the variance in adults\u2019 romantic partner- and best friend-specific attachment anxiety, and 10 to 11 percent in their partner- and best friend-specific avoidance.Just slightly less modest that analogous parental predictors, according to their claims.reply",
      "One study doesn\u2019t definitively prove anything, but this is a 30 year longitudinal analysis with 700 participants. It\u2019s way bigger than a typical studyreply",
      "My first reaction was to refute this, but I think I've convinced myself this may be correct, assuming attachment styles are the right frame.I've been painted with the Avoidant brush, and logically it makes sense, broken home, removed from mother, moved regularly changing schools once a year for 5 years.However, my siblings are the opposite. We come from the same house, they didn't change schools as often as I did, which made me wonder how we could be so different.But when looked through the lens of friendships forming the attachment style, it makes more sense. I changed schools more often than my siblings, and therefore had more friendship changes, and less ability for attachment.reply",
      "Also, beware of taking generalities (such as the claims of this study) and applying that directly that to your specific life, or anyone else's.I mean, I like your comment and am glad you got thinking about this, but it's just a line of reasoning that I see a lot and I wish I saw less, so that's why I bring it up (:\"True for most people\" does not imply \"true for me\" or \"true for that person over there\".And the reverse is not valid either, of course - \"true for me\" does not imply \"true for most people.\"There's always some tension between people's individual anecdotes and experiences (which are fascinating, and I like), and the claims of broader studies like this one.Sometimes I try to remind myself of this with the \"on average, people have 2.3 children\" factoid. Obviously, nobody actually has 2.3 children; the general truth does not necessarily apply to specific individuals; potentially not even a single one.reply",
      "100% agree. I actually think of attachment styles like this generally. Your upbringing does not dictate your life, it influences.reply",
      "The family is a system, with different roles played by each participant. For instance, in toxic families, there is often one scapegoat, with an anxious attachment style, that affords the avoidant types in the family to participate in delusions.What are the dynamics like of everyone in your family?reply",
      "Similar story here.  Six schools by seventh grade.  I think it does mess with you a bit.reply",

Successors to the highly successful Valve Index and Steam Deck, these devices are set to be released in the coming year.Igalia has long worked with Valve on SteamOS, which will power the Machine and Frame, and is excited to be contributing to these new devices, particularly the Frame.

Even if it squeezes out every single other sector that happens to want to use SDRAM to do things OTHER than buffer memory before it's fed into a PCIE lane for a GPU.- I'm really REALLY glad i decided to buy brand new gaming laptops for my wife and I just a couple months ago, after not having upgraded our gaming laptops for 7 and 9 years respectively. It seems like gamers are going to have this the worst - GPUs have been f'd for a long time due to crypto and AI, and now even DRAM isn't safe. Plus SSD prices are going up too. And unlike many other DRAM users where it's a business thing and they can to some degree just hike prices to cover - gamers are obviously not running businesses. It's just making the hobby more expensive.reply",

Except there's no election to get on to the central committee, it's like in the Soviet era where you had to run in the right circles and have sway in them.There's too much group-think in the executive class. Too much forced adoption of AI, too much bandwagon hopping.The return-to-office fad is similar, a bunch of executives following the mandates of their board, all because there's a few CEOs who were REALLY worked up about it and there was a decision that workers had it too easy. Watching the executive class sacrifice profits for power is pretty fascinating.Edit: A good way to decentralize the power and have better decision making would be to have less centralized rewards in the capital markets. Right now are living through a new gilded age with a few barons running things, because we have made the rewards too extreme and too narrowly distributed. Most market economics assumes that there's somewhat equal decision making power amongst the econs. We are quickly trending away from that.reply",

      "People in this thread are worried that they are significantly vulnerable if they don't update right away. However, this is mostly not an issue in practice. A lot of software doesn't have continuous deployment, but instead has customer-side deployment of new releases, which follow a slower rhythm of several weeks or months, barring emergencies. They are fine. Most vulnerabilities that aren't supply-chain attacks are only exploitable under special circumstances anyway. The thing to do is to monitor your dependencies and their published vulnerabilities, and for critical vulnerabilities to assess whether your product is affect by it. Only then do you need to update that specific dependency right away.reply",
      "> for critical vulnerabilities to assess whether your product is affect by it. Only then do you need to update that specific dependency right away.This is indeed what's missing from the ecosystem at large. People seem to be under the impression that if a new release of software/library/OS/application is released, you need to move to it today. They don't seem to actually look through the changes, only doing that if anything breaks, and then proceed to upgrade because \"why not\" or \"it'll only get harder in the future\", neither which feel like solid choices considering the trade-offs.While we've seen to already have known that it introduces massive churn and unneeded work, it seems like we're waking up to the realization that it is a security tradeoff as well, to stay at the edge of version numbers. Sadly, not enough tooling seems to take this into account (yet?).reply",
      "At my last job, we only updated dependencies when there was a compelling reason.  It was awful.What would happen from time to time was that an important reason did come up, but the team was now many releases behind.  Whoever was unlucky enough to sign up for the project that needed the updated dependency now had to do all those updates of the dependency, including figuring out how they affected a bunch of software that they weren't otherwise going to work on.  (e.g., for one code path, I need a bugfix that was shipped three years ago, but pulling that into my component affects many other code paths.)  They now had to go figure out what would break, figure out how to test it, etc.  Besides being awful for them, it creates bad incentives (don't sign up for those projects; put in hacks to avoid having to do the update), and it's also just plain bad for the business because it means almost any project, however simple it seems, might wind up running into this pit.I now think of it this way: either you're on the dependency's release train or you jump off.  If you're on the train, you may as well stay pretty up to date.  It doesn't need to be every release the minute it comes out, but nor should it be \"I'll skip months of work and several major releases until something important comes out\".  So if you decline to update to a particular release, you've got to ask: am I jumping off forever, or am I just deferring work?  If you think you're just deferring the decision until you know if there's a release worth updating to, you're really rolling the dice.(edit: The above experience was in Node.js.  Every change in a dynamically typed language introduces a lot of risk.  I'm now on a team that uses Rust, where knowing that the program compiles and passes all tests gives us a lot of confidence in the update.  So although there's a lot of noise with regular dependency updates, it's not actually that much work.)reply",
      "I think it also depends on the community as well. Last time I touched Node.js and Javascript-related things, every time I tried to update something, it practically guaranteed something would explode for no reason.While my recent legacy Java project migration from JDK 8 -> 21 & a ton of dependency upgrades has been a pretty smooth experience so far.reply",
      "Yeah, along with any community's attitudes to risk and quality, there is also a varying, er, chronological component.I'd prefer to upgrade around the time most of the nasty surprises have already been discovered by somebody else, preferably with workarounds developed.At the same time, you don't want to be so far back that upgrading uncovers novel migration problems, or issues that nobody else cares about anymore.reply",
      "> I'm now on a team that uses Rust, where knowing that the program compiles and passes all tests gives us a lot of confidence in the update.That's been my experience as well. In addition, the ecosystem largely holds to semver, which means a non-major upgrade tends to be painless, and conversely, if there's a major upgrade, you know not to put it off for too long because it'll involve some degree of migration.reply",

      "I fought off the local imposition of Dependabot by executive fiat about a year ago by pointing out that it maximizes vulnerabilities to supply chain attacks if blindly followed or used as a metric excessively stupidly. Maximizing vulnerabilities was not the goal, after all. You do not want to harass teams with the fact that DeeplyNestedDepen just went from 1.1.54-rc2 to 1.1.54-rc3 because the worst case is that they upgrade just to shut the bot up.I think I wouldn't object to \"Dependabot on a 2-week delay\" as something that at least flags. However working in Go more than anything else it was often the case even so that dependency alerts were just an annoyance if they aren't tied to a security issue or something. Dynamic languages and static languages do not have the same risk profiles at all. The idea that some people have that all dependencies are super vital to update all the time and the casual expectation of a constant stream of vital security updates is not a general characteristic of programming, it is a specific characteristic not just of certain languages but arguably the community attached to those languages.(What we really need is capabilities, even at a very gross level, so we can all notice that the supposed vector math library suddenly at version 1.43.2 wants to add network access, disk reading, command execution, and cryptography to the set of things it wants to do, which would raise all sorts of eyebrows immediately, even perhaps in an automated fashion. But that's a separate discussion.)reply",

And just as someone can hammer a nail poorly, so too can a matrix be multiplied poorly. I would say the matrices being multiplied in service of training LLMs are not a particularly beautiful example of what matrix multiplication has to offer.

      "Let me try.In US schools during K-12, we generally learn functions in two ways:1. 2-d line chart with an x-axis and y-axis, like temperature over time, history of stock price, etc. Classic independent variable is on the horizontal axis, dependent variable is on the vertical axis. And even people who forgotten almost all math can instantly understand the graphics displayed when they're watching CNBC or a TV weather report.2. We also think of functions like little machines that do things for us. E.g., y = f(x) means that f() is like a black box. We give the black box input 'x'; then the black box f() returns output 'y'. (Obviously very relevant to the life of programmers.)But one of 3blue-1brown's excellent videos finally showed me at least a few more ways of thinking of functions. This is where a function acts as a map from what \"thing\" to another thing (technically from Domain X to Co-Domain Y).So if we think of NVIDIA stock price over time (Interpretation 1) as a graph, it's not just a picture that goes up and to the right. It's mapping each point in time on the x-axis to a price on the y-axis, sure! Let's use the example, x=November 21, 2025 maps to y=$178/share. Of course, interpretation 2 might say that the black box of the function takes in \"November 21, 2025\" as input and returns \"$178\" as output.But what what I call Interpretation 3 does is that it maps from the domain of Time to the output Co-domain of NVDA Stock Price.3. This is a 1D to 1D mapping. aka, both x and y are scalar values. In the language that jamespropp used, we send the value \"November 21, 2025\" to the value \"$178\".But we need not restrict ourselves to a 1-dimensional input domain (time) and a 1-dimensional output domain (price).We could map from a 2-d Domain X to another 2-d Co-Domain Y. For example X could be 2-d geographical coordinates. And Y could be 2-d wind vector.So we would feed input of say location (5,4) as input. and our 2Dto2D function would output wind vector (North by 2mph, East by 7mph).So we are \"sending\" input (5,4) in the first 2d plane to output (+2,+7) in the second 2d plane.reply"

      "My opinions of Vulkan have not changed significantly since this was posted a year ago https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40601605I'm sure Vulkan is fun and wonderful for people who really want low level control of the graphic stack, but I found it completely miserable to use. I still haven't really found a graphics API that works at the level I want that I enjoyed using; I would like to get more into graphics programming since I do think it would be fun to build a game engine, but I will admit that even getting started with the low level Vulkan stuff is still scary to me.I think what I want is something like how SDL does 2D graphics, but for 3D.  My understanding is that for 3D in SDL you just drop into OpenGL or something, which isn't quite what I want.Maybe WebGPU would be something I could have fun working on.reply",
      "`wgpu` in Rust is an excellent middle ground, matching the abstraction level of WebGPU. More capable than OpenGL, but you don\u2019t have to deal with things like resource barriers and layout transitions.The reason you don\u2019t is that it does an amount of bookkeeping for you at runtime, only supports using a single, general queue per device, and several other limitations that only matter when you want to max out the capabilities of the hardware.Vulkan is miserable, but several things are improved by using a few extensions supported by almost all relevant vendors. The misery mostly pays off, but there are a couple of cases where the API asks you for a lot of detail which all major drivers then happily go ahead ignore completely.reply",

It took me around 3 months to do it without any previous knowledge of Vulkan (I had previous OpenGL experience and some experience with making game engines, though).The engine wasn\u2019t implemented as a general purpose engine, which is probably why it took me a few months (and not years) to achieve this. I started by making a small 3D game and separated reusable parts into the \u201cengine\u201d afterwards.

      "It's a shame that this didn't end up going anywhere. When Qualcomm was doing their press stuff prior to the Snapdragon X launch, they said that they'd be putting equal effort into supporting both Windows and Linux. If anyone here is running Linux on a Snapdragon X laptop, I'd be curious to know what the experience is like today.I will say that Intel has kind of made the original X Elite chips irrelevant with their Lunar Lake chips. They have similar performance/battery life, and run cool (so you can use the laptop on your lap or in bed without it overheating), but have full Linux support today and you don't have to deal with x86 emulation. If anyone needs a thin & light Linux laptop today, they're probably your best option. Personally, I get 10-14 hours of real usage (not manufacturer \"offline video playback with the brightness turned all the way down\" numbers) on my Vivobook S14 running Fedora KDE. In the future, it'll be interesting to see how Intel's upcoming Panther Lake chips compare to Snapdragon X2.reply",
      "Roughly the same on my Intel Lenovo. It\u2019s a great little machine. And Linux runs nicely.reply",

      "Forget equal effort: Start off with hardware docs.reply",
      "Equal effort is far more likely from Qualcomm than hardware docs. They don't even freely share docs with partners, and many important things are restricted even from their own engineers. I've seen military contractors less paranoid than QCOM.reply",
      "I'd have to say that full  hardware documentation, even under NDA, is prerequisite to claim equal effort. The expectation on a desktop platform (that is, explicitly not mobile, like phones or tablets) is that development is mostly open for those who want to, and Qualcomm's business is sort of fundamentally counter to that. So either they're going to have to change those expectations (which I would prefer not to happen), provide more to manufacturers, or expect that their market performance will be poor.reply",
      "While I almost certainly wouldn't have done more than wished for one, it's a shame they're not getting any return for their effort.reply",
      "Does anyone know why Linux laptop battery life is so bad? Is it a case of devices needing to be turned off that aren't? Poor CPU scheduling?reply",
      "It's ACPI - most laptops ship with half-broken ACPI tables, and provide support for tunables through windows drivers. It's convenient for laptop manufacturers, because Microsoft makes it very easy to update drivers via windows update, and small issues with sleep, performance, etc. can be mostly patched through a driver update.Linux OTOH can only use the information it has from ACPI to accomplish things like CPU power states, etc. So you end up with issues like \"the fans stop working after my laptop wakes from sleep\" because of a broken ACPI implementation.There are a couple of laptops with excellent battery life under linux though, and if you can find a lunar lake laptop with iGPU and IPS screen, you can idle around 3-4W and easily get 12+ hours of battery.reply",
      "> Does anyone know why Linux laptop battery life is so bad?It's extremely dependent on the hardware and driver quality. On ARM and contemporary x86 that's even more true, because (among other things) laptops suspend individual devices (\"suspend-to-idle\" or \"S0ix\" or \"Modern Standby\"), and any one device failing to suspend properly has a disproportionate impact.That said, to a first approximation, this is a case where different people have wildly different experiences, and people who buy high-end well-supported hardware experience a completely different world than people who install Linux on whatever random hardware they have. For instance, Linux on a ThinkPad has excellent battery life, sometimes exceeding Windows.reply"

In particular, the long battery runtimes\u2014usually one of the strong arguments for ARM devices\u2014were not achieved under Linux. A viable approach for BIOS updates under Linux is also missing at this stage, as is fan control. Virtualization with KVM is not foreseeable on our model, nor are the high USB4 transfer rates.

      "One thing that needs to be emphasized with \u201cdurable execution\u201d engines is they don\u2019t actually get you out of having to handle errors, rollbacks, etc. Even the canonical examples everyone uses - so you\u2019re using a DE engine to restart a sales transaction, but the part of that transaction that failed was \u201ccharging the customer\u201d - did it fail before or after the charge went through? You failed while updating the inventory system - did the product get marked out or not? All of these problems are tractable, but once you\u2019ve solved them - once you\u2019ve built sufficient atomicity into your system to handle the actual failure cases - the benefits of taking on the complexity of a DE system are substantially lower than the marketing pitch.reply",
      "The key to a durable workflow is making each step idempotent.  Then you don't have to worry about those things.  You just run the failed step again.  If it already worked the first time, it's a no-op.For example, stripe lets you include an idempotency key with your request.  If you try to make a charge again with the same key, it ignores you. A DE framework like DBOS will automatically generate the idempotency key for you.But you're correct, if you can't make the operation idempotent, then you have to handle that yourself.reply",
      "Temporal plus idempotency keys solves probably the majority of infrastructure normally needed for production systemsreply",
      "Except to run temporal at scale on prem you\u2019ll need 50x the infra you had before.reply",
      "Indeed, one of the main selling points of DBOS. All the functionality of Temporal without any of the infrastructure.reply",
      "Ah I don't know if I would agree with that. Temporal does a lot of stuff; we just don't happen to need most of it and it's really heavyweight on the database side (running low 500 or so workflows/second of their own 'hello world' style echo benchmark translates to 100k database ops/second..DBOS is tied to Postgres, right? That wouldn't scale anywhere near where we need either.Sadly there aren't many shortcuts in this space and pretending there are seems a bit hip at the moment. In the end, mostly everyone who can afford to solve such problems are gonna end up writing their own systems for this.reply",
      "In my one encounter with one of these systems it induced new code and tooling complexity, orders of magnitude performance overhead for most operations, and made dev and debug workflows much slower. All for... an occasional convenience far outweighed by the overall drag of using it. There are probably other environments where something like this makes sense but I can't figure out what they are.reply",
      "I'm not sure which one you used, but ideally it's so lightweight that the benefits outweigh the slight cost of developing with them.  Besides the recovery benefit, there is observability and debugging benefits too.reply",
      "I don't want to start a debate about a specific vendor but the cost was very high. Leaky serialization of call arguments and results, then hairpinning messages across the internet and back to get to workers. 200ms overhead for a no-op call. There was some observability benefit but it didn't allow for debugger access and had its own special way of packaging code so net add of complexity there too. That's not getting into the induced complexity caused by adding a bunch of RPC boundaries to fit their execution model. All that and using the thing effectively still requires understanding their runtime model. I understand the motivation, but not the technical approach.reply",
      "> All for... an occasional convenience far outweighed by the overall drag of using itIf you have any long-running operation that could be interrupted mid-run by any network fluke (or the termination of the VM running your program, or your program being OOMed, or some issue with some third party service that your app talks to, etc), and you don\u2019t want to restart the whole thing from scratch, you could benefit from these systems. The alternative is having engineers manually try to repair the state and restart execution in just the right place and that scales very badly.I have an application that needs to stand up a bunch of cloud infrastructure (a \u201cworkspace\u201d in which users can do research) on the press of a button, and I want to make sure that the right infrastructure exists even if some deployment attempt is interrupted or if the upstream definition of a workspace changes. Every month there are dozens of network flukes or 5XX errors from remote endpoints that would otherwise leave these workspaces in a broken state and in need of manual repair. Instead, the system heals itself whenever the fault clears and I basically never have to look at the system (I periodically check the error logs, however, to confirm that the system is actually recovering from faults\u2014I worry that the system has caught fire and there\u2019s actually some bug in the alerting system that is keeping things quiet).reply"
