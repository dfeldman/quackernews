      "> that era was so raw and fresh, the future was being invented right there! Very happy daysI've been told by several Gen-Z that they've never been to a \"rave\", and I feel sorry for them. In my town, we had quite the underground scene, but then times changed and it is so much smaller now. Now, \"kids\" just call it all EDM instead of the specific genre that we know and love.\n \nreply",
      "There's still plenty of fresh underground music and the 'kids' are doing just fine.  Yeah there's loads of mainstream garbage out there, but there always was.  The main difference is that this stuff was being invented, whereas most electronic music now is derived from those early 90s invented genres, but even saying that there's still plenty of creativity.There's a night in London called Cartulis (which is usually at Fold), when I go there it feels very much like the early rave scene to me (this is just one example, of course).  I think there's a tendency when we get older to not be as exposed to the bubbling undercurrent of music, so it's easy to just say \"it's not as good as it used to be\", but that would be a mistake imho.  It's there if you look for it.\n \nreply",
      "I'm interested in a lot of subculture music, and it really isn't there like it was for the most part.  Most families of music seem to have stagnated or regressed.  The early 90s gangster rap is definitely superior to mumble rap/emo rap, the 90s IDM/jungle/trance is superior to modern EDM/house/trap and the pop mainstream now is just garbage compared to the the mainstream from the late 80s/90s.Mixing and production are worlds better and musicianship has improved compared to where it was for genres where people care about musicianship, but the actual music is mostly either painfully derivative or actively worse because it's trying too hard to be \"different.\"Modern metal is amazing compared to the stuff from the 90s though.\n \nreply",
      "I agree with you as far as Hip-Hop quality goes (assuming that \"gangster\" encompasses things like Old School East Coast, G-Funk, etc). There was a beauty in how limited the production assets of Hip-Hop were in those days, which fostered a very special kind of creativity. Not to mention how it intermixed with the afro-zeitgeist of that time.But for example techno and house these days have such a gargantuan amount of variety. And because those genres were digital-ish to begin with, they didn't suffer as much from the evolution of DAWs compared to some other genres.This would have done well at a 90s rave (especially from 4:45 onward): https://open.spotify.com/track/5v2NmAWURnM260nd2acPLrI guess for \"90s\" Metal it strongly varies how much studio backing there was and if it is early or late 90s.

      "> Mixing and production are worlds betterLong gone are the days of \"shoes in the dryer\" mixes where guys were just slamming two DATs together with no pitch control. Sadly, I think we've gotten to the point of those tight mixes being less of the skill of the DJ and the result of software. With everything being done on laptops with cool software, I really wonder how many DJs are even mixing and just performing while a premixed file plays.But as you say, the production quality has definitely improved. The music is just clean with no quality loss from layering/multi-tracking/bouncing. The concept of the space between notes has never been so distinguished.\n \nreply",
      "I didn't intend someone taking away from that no fresh music was being made. I simply said that the parties of old are no longer happening, so that experience isn't available to them.I'm constantly listening to new music, and I've come up with lots of new tracks that will make a helluva set list, one day. Problem I have is only owning 1200s, and none of the gear to let those drive digital files.

      "A lot of comments are focusing on the value as a RISC-V development platform, which is obviously important, but I'm also hopeful that this presages more Framework mainboard options besides just what Framework itself offers. There is already a pretty big community offering I/O modules beyond Framework's options, but the true benefit of a Framework system is in the ability to not be locked in to only what one company things is worth the time and effort to develop.

Energy embodied in GPUs and machines amortizes over their lifetimes and should be counted against all the things those GPUs did, do and will do, of which the training in question is just a small part.

      "Just saw this, congratulations! Would you mind giving an ELI5 explanation for a wider audience?\n \nreply",
      "[Not the OP but I think I understand it well enough to take a whack at an ELI5.]Elliptic curves are a particular kind of cubic equation, exactly like the quadratic equations you studied in junior high algebra, except with one term being raised to the third power instead of just squared (and a few other conditions).  It turns out that these equations have vastly more complicated behavior than quadratics and give rise to a whole host of problems that mathematicians are still working to solve.  One of the interesting problems arises when you ask: what are the solutions to the equation if we restrict ourselves only to rational numbers?  It turns out that rational solutions to elliptic curve equations can be grouped into families of solutions where each member of the family can be derived from other members by linear operations (addition and multiplication by a constant).  The number of such families of solutions is called the rank of the equation.  (Note: it's actually a little more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it.  See [1] if you want the details.)It is observed empirically (by solving lots of elliptic curve equations) that the rank tends to be small.  Indeed, the elliptic curve that made the news did so because it has a rank of 29, the largest rank currently known.  But no one knows if this is the biggest possible (almost certainly not) or if there is an upper bound on the possible rank of an elliptic curve.  Solving that would win you a Fields medal.(Note: there are results on the upper bound of the average rank of families of elliptic curves [2] but that is not the same as an absolute upper bound.)---[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_an_elliptic_curve[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_an_elliptic_curve#Uppe...\n \nreply",

      "For the longest time I thought elliptic curves where quadratic curves.Wouldn't it had been more accurate to name them elliptic surfaces?\n \nreply",
      "The name derives from the fact that they originally arose in connection with trying to determine the arc length of an ellipse.  See:https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/mypapers/wayn...\n \nreply",
      "They're curves (one-dimensional), not surfaces. An example of an elliptic curve is y^2 = x^3 + 1. The polynomial P(x,y) = x^3 + 1 - y^2 has degree 3. A surface is a 2 dimensional geometric shape.\n \nreply",
      "Just to be clear, an ellipse is a quadratic curve.  Ellipses are not elliptic curves.  (They are still curves, though, as long as you restrict to plugging in real numbers, not complex.)  The terminology is unfortunate.\n \nreply",
      "Well, the basics, oversimplified, are this:- In general, elliptic curves are solutions of P(x, y) = 0 where P is a polynomial of degree 3 in two variables. \"Points\" on the curve are solutions of this equation.- If you intersect an elliptic curve with a straight line, you end up with a polynomial in one variable, of degree 3 (in general). Since a polynomial of degree 3 has 3 solutions (in the appropriate context), this means that if you have two points on the curve, and you draw a line through these two points, there is a third aligned with them which belongs to the curve. So we have an operation on the curve, which to every pair of points associates a third point. This can be explicitly calculated.- It can be proven (again, by explicit calculation) that this operation is associative and commutative, and that there is a \"zero\" element, i.e. that this operation forms a \"group\".Now we want to study these elliptic curves and their associated groups with one additional condition: that the points are rational, i.e. have coordinates that are rational numbers (a/b). For each curve with rational parameters (i.e. the coefficients of the polynomial are rational), we want to study the rational points of this curve.For some elliptic curves, there is a finite number of points, so the associated group is a finite commutative group.For other elliptic curves, however, there are infinitely many rational points, and mathematicians have wanted to classify their structure.A foundational result in number theory known as the Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve over a number field (such as the rationals, \u211a) is finitely generated. In other words, although there may be infinitely many points, they can be expressed as a finite set of points (known as \"generators\") combined under the group operation. This structure forms what is called a \"finitely generated abelian group\", which can be decomposed into a direct sum of a finite subgroup (called the \"torsion\") and a free part of rank r, where r is called the \"rank\" of the elliptic curve.This rank \"r\" essentially measures the \"size\" of the free part of the group and has deep implications in both theoretical and computational number theory. For example, if r=0, the group is finite, meaning that the set of rational points on the curve is limited to a finite collection. When r>0, there are infinitely many rational points, which can be generated by combining a finite number of points.So the challenge is to find a curve with a large number of generators. All of these computations (for a given curve at least) are quite explicit, and can be carried out with a bignum library (the numbers tend to get quite large quickly). I used PARI/GP for my thesis.\n \nreply"

      "Skimming the actual paper ... it seems pretty bad?The thing about Beethoven's 9th and biological materials which is mentioned in the OP is just that, out of a very large knowledge graph, they found small subgraph isomorphic to a subgraph created from a text about the symphony. But they seem not to cover the fact that a sufficiently large graph with some high-level statistical properties would have small subgraphs isomorphic to a 'query' graph. Is this one good or meaningful in some way, or is it just an inevitable outcome of having produced such a large knowledge graph at the start? The reader can't really tell, because figure 8 which presents the two graphs has such a poor resolution that one cannot read any of the labels. We're just expected to see \"oh the nodes and their degrees match so it has the right shape\", but that doesn't really tell us that their system had any insight through this isomorphism-based mining process.For the stuff about linking art (e.g. a Kandinsky painting) with material design ... they used an LLM to generate a description of a material for DALL-E where the prompt includes information about the painting, and then they show the resulting image and the painting. But there's no measure of what a \"good\" material description is, and there certainly is no evaluation of the contribution of the graph-based \"reasoning\". In particular an obvious comparison would be to \"Describe this painting.\" -> \"Construct a prompt for DALL-E to portray a material whose structure has properties informed by this description of a painting ...\" -> render.It really seems like the author threw a bunch of stuff against the wall and didn't even look particularly closely to see if it stuck.Also, the only equation in the paper is the author giving the definition of cosine similarity, before 2 paragraphs justifying its use in constructing their graph.

      "This is a win for price competition - the \"broker fee\" paid by the renter is a classic example of principal agent problems / information asymmetry.First, the service is being provided to the landlord (listing, tours, etc.), not the client, for all listings these days (I don't know any young person who has ever used a renter's agent, except maybe if it's provided in a relocation package). The renter has no choice in which broker to use to find/transact w/ the property, so there's very little price pressure for these broker fees.Second the information asymmetry - the terms of the fee are completely opaque in the listings, and are not disclosed basically until signing unless you press brokers earlier. So there's basically no competitive pressure pushing these fees down, since it's basically a \"junk fee\" from a user experience perspective tacked on at the very end (and not listed on listings), and the landlord - who IS in a position to negotiate on price - doesn't care.I don't buy the argument that there will be some long-term price hike in rents as a result of this decision - people who rent for 1-5 years already are paying a MASSIVE \"net effective\" premium for having an additional month's rent tacked on up front - but also it strongly incentivizes tenant retention (e.g. by being more responsive, keeping prices lower, etc.), because the landlord does not want to have to eat a broker's fee next listing.\n \nreply",
      "Perfectly said on both counts. Rents, unlike broker fees, are highly transparent prices that are far more influenced by market pressure and competition, a win for buyers in a market already very lopsided toward sellers. Because broker fees are disclosed selectively and later in the purchase funnel, buyers (renters) often make less optimal and more expensive choices due to that information asymmetry.There definitely will be a small spike in the cost of rentals, but 1) it will definitely not be a perfect 12-15% transfer from what the fee costs, and 2) I predict that downward price pressure will bring rental costs around what they are now, especially given the prevalence of no fee units. The cost will likely just cut into landlords' revenue, and anyone claiming prices will rise substantially are probably lobbying on behalf of landlords.\n \nreply",
      "Tenants will have more cash each month.  Tenants bid up rents to the point of affordability, and they'll become more affordable.   Furthermore, there will be more would-be tenants b/c you don't need to save up a for a broker fee -- as long as your income is high enough, you can get a unit, at least in theory.  So more competition....\n \nreply",

The broker is banking on you balking, so she gets to tell the owner (who's never met you or even been to the US) \"sorry - the existing tenant doesn't want to renew, so you're going to have to pay me to market the apartment again.\"\n \nreply",

They will be able to charge more, especially on renewal leases.2) Rent regulated apartments:  LLs can't play those games, but they can say 'only available if you hire such and such a broker',  or they might only list the apartments on a website that operates on a subscription basis where they get a cut somehow.   Or,  at the margins, this is a significant cost for money-losing units, so they might just add those units to the list of units permanently off the market.I do expect brokerage fees to decline somewhat, and this may affect pricing for streeteasy and zillow and the other advertising portals,  but this is not going to be a huge change, and is going to hurt a bunch of low-income tenants.\n \nreply",

      "Lots of interesting debates in this thread. I think it is worth placing writing/coding tasks into two buckets. Are you producing? Or are you learning?For example, I have zero qualms about relying on AI at work to write progress reports and code up some scripts. I know I can do it myself but why would I? I spent many years in college learning to read and write and code. AI makes me at least 2x more efficient at my job. It seems irrational not to use it. Like a farmer who tills his land by hand rather than relying on a tractor because it builds character or something. But there is something to be said about atrophy. If you don't use it, you lose it. I wonder if my coding skill will deteriorate in the years to come...On the other hand, if you are a student trying to learn something new, relying on AI requires walking a fine line. You don't want to over-rely on AI because a certain degree of \"productive struggle\" is essential for learning something deeply. At the same time, if you under-rely on AI, you drastically decrease the rate at which you can learn new things.In the old days, people were fit because of physical labor. Now people are fit because they go to the gym. I wonder if there will be an analog for intellectual work. Will people be going to \"mental\" gyms in the future?\n \nreply",
      ">  a certain degree of \"productive struggle\" is essentialHonestly, I'm not sure this would account for most of the difficulty in learning. In my experience most of the difficulty involved in learning something involved a few missing pieces of insight. It often took longer to understand the few missing pieces than the rest of the topic. If they are accurate enough, LLMs are great for getting yourself unstuck and keep yourself moving. Although it has always been a part of the learning experience, I'm not sure frantically looking through hundreds of explanations for a missing detail is a better use of one's time than to dig deeper in the time you save.\n \nreply",

In saying this, these fans claim that disabled people do not have a right to feel safe when watching their favorite series, and that their wellbeing doesn\u2019t matter in comparison to a few brighter shots of teenagers using their magic powers to punch each other.I don't get it. Why is it bad wanting to see the unsafe version for yourself?> Over 2500 fans signed a change.org petition asking Crunchyroll to take down this edited, safe, version of the series and instead upload an unedited version that was true to the original vision\u2014even if it had the potential to cause seizures.That's not how I read the petition in question. People are asking to get access to the original that they know exist.

      "> As fans, we implore Crunchyroll to try to acquire an uncut version of the simulcast as we are paying good money each month for the services they provide.Seems like they want Crunchyroll to offer it, I wasn't able to spot a mention of taking the safe one down; it's an uncharitable or invalid characterization on the part of the author imo\n \nreply",
      "The whole vibe of the petition was dismissive of the issues and only argued for getting the flashing version, so I understand author's view. E.g.> These things are supposed to help prevent seizures, [...] the ghosting is almost making the visual stimuli worse as people have attested to feeling nauseous and dizzy from the obscene amounts of frame blending.Emphasis mine.I don't know how bad the blurring was in motion, but I read the petitioner's argument as \"this version is worse in every way for reasons that are only hypothetical\". I really don't see much room for a generous interpretation.\n \nreply",
