      "I tried to finish this quiz but just can\u2019t. Every question I got was a very big, \u201cit depends on context\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you prefer strong static or dynamic or a mix?\u201d Well\u2026 are we teaching 9th graders an intro to coding, writing a quick script to answer a bespoke data question, or writing a data processing library?\u201cOn algorithms I focus on\u2026\u201d  Okay, well\u2026 do we care about performance? Where is it running? How often will it run? Will the code be disposed of soon or live a decade? Do we need it working today or next week?I just don\u2019t understand how to even begin formulating  an opinion on any of these questions without any context.To use the compass analogy: shouldn\u2019t you want to best know how to use a compass? What value is there in saying, \u201cmy favourite bearing is east-northeast\u201d? That is, the substance in any of this is the \u201cit depends\u2026\u201d portion. Any answers to this quiz are really just a proxy for the kinds of contexts people are solving problems in.reply",
      "I have the same issue. For many of the questions my answer is \"all of the above, but A in context A, B in context B, etc.\". Many are also not mutually exclusive.Take this example: \"When debugging I typically:\"> Write tests to isolate the problemIn the case of math functions, or more primitive building blocks, writing tests can help ensure correctness of the underlying functions, to exclude them from the problem search.> Reason about the code logically firstThis is always useful.> Use a debugger to step through code systematicallyUseful when dealing with a larger codebase and the control flow is hard to follow. The call stack can give quick guidance over trying to manually decipher the control flow.> Add print statements to understand data flow:Useful when debugging continuous data streams or events, e.g. mouse input, where you don't want to interrupt the user interaction that needs to be debugged.reply",
      "Is the fact that the answer isn\u2019t easy a feature or bug?reply",
      "I landed right in the middle - -1, -2. Which seems weird because I\u2019m very opinionated about a lot of this stuff. I like a lot of the questions but a lot of my answers felt like I was arbitrarily picking something. That\u2019s probably why.Eg for testing, do I want \u201cwhatever finds bugs most effectively\u201d or \u201cproperty based testing\u201d? Well, property based testing is usually the most time efficient way to find bugs. So, yes both of those. Debugging: do I use print statements, or a debugger, or logically think it through? Yes all of those. But if I arbitrarily said I use a debugger in a multiple choice test, I don\u2019t think that tells you much about how I code!I do - controversially - think some of the answers are naming bad practices. Like abstraction first is a bad idea - since you know the least about your problem before you start programming it up. Abstraction first inevitably bakes in whatever bad assumptions you walked in the door with into your code. Better to code something - anything - up and use what you learned in the process to iterate on your software architecture decisions. I also generally hate modern OO and these days I prefer static types over dynamic types.But yeah. Interesting questions! Thanks for putting this together.reply",
      "Same. I got dead centre, even though I feel like I have strong biases, and rarely agree with my coworkers on design and style choices.reply",
      "Maybe your preferences are so contradictory that they cancel each other out :)I got very close to centre also, just slightly on the \"concrete\" and \"human friendly\" sides. But who wouldn't want to be concrete or human-friendly?reply",
      "I likewise got very close to the centre, and was surprised.If you had shown me the diagram only, and asked me to position myself on it I would have placed myself on the middle of the perimeter of the second quadrant (135 degrees along the circumference), to indicate that I strongly prefer human friendly and concrete over computer friendly and abstract respectively.And even as I was answering the questions I felt that I was leaning heavily towards that, with answers like starting simple, documenting well and so on.I think some of the pull in the opposite direction comes down to interpretation as well.And actually I see in the repo for the quiz there is a JSON file that contains scores for each question that one could have a look at to see if the answers are scored the same way that you think they would be.For people who haven\u2019t done the quiz yet, don\u2019t look at the json file until after taking the quiz.https://github.com/treeform/devcompas/blob/master/questions....reply",

      "Here's a recent Raft story from when I was trying to learn how to use it. I'm working on coding a multiplayer io game for fun. One key part was that it needs replication of game state so that live games can fail over if one of the servers crashes or is restarted.I was like, \"wait, that's what raft does, and my game state is already a state machine ... let's do this thing\". I then ended up putting my entire game state into raft, and even abused it as a generic pubsub engine.It was fun, and it worked, and was actually not hard to setup using the Rust implementation.\nThen when I was done, I realized how pathological it was to put literally all game state and every single event into Raft, so decided to stop indulging myself by having fun and trying to hack Raft into an unintended use case, and just used Redis for game state and pubsub.I never load tested the Raft implementation, but once I do have some perf testing tools, I'd be interesting to run the Raft code vs. Redis comparison to see how throughput differs. For this use case, at some point Raft should fall over while Redis would be chugging along.reply",

      "How does one precisely define love for purposes of defining morality?The article\u2019s author was very imprecise, defining love and morality in subjective terms relating to one\u2019s personal outlook and perceptions of others.I\u2019m not at all interested in subjective morality.The reason most philosophers have defined morality and ethics in terms of duties and obligations is precisely to try to remove subjectivity.  I\u2019m not saying anyone has been successful, but other approaches don\u2019t appear to lead towards objective morality.reply",
      "The idea that morality is grounded in love rather than rules sounds appealing but it collapses once applied outside personal relationships. Love is subjective and unevenly distributed. People love their family more than strangers, their country more than foreigners. If morality is only love, then preference and bias become virtue. That is no foundation for fairness in law, politics, or daily life.Rules and duties exist to correct for partiality. The point of justice is that it applies equally, even when love does not. A judge cannot acquit someone because she loves him, a doctor cannot favour a patient because he is charming. Love without principle too easily becomes nepotism or tribalism. The most brutal conflicts in history were driven by deep love for one\u2019s own group, not lack of it.Love matters for motivation. It can inspire people to act with kindness. But moral frameworks require more than sentiment. They need universality and consistency, which only rules and duties can provide. Murdoch\u2019s vision mistakes a source of energy for the standard itself. Without shared norms, love does not scale beyond the private sphere.reply",
      "It seems that you are conflating attachment with love, which is often done, but always wrong. They are absolutely not the same thing and are at odds with one another as often as they align, if not more often - as your examples illustrate.It is possible to hold love for everyone, in any situation, regardless of the circumstances. Of course no one is perfect and so just because something is possible does not mean it always occurs. But this is not the point.The point is that the origin of morality is love. In the absence of the experience of love, it is possible to approximate the correct behaviours to imitate it, but it is a pale and brittle imitation of real love-derived action and most often descends into immorality under pressure or nuance.The modern justice system is a fantastic example of this. It doesn't work in any but the most extreme cases - and even then there is an argument to be made against it. Locking people up like animals doesn't improve society or help the offenders. It provides a temporary relief to victims but even that is hollow. Punishing children has been repeatedly shown to be ineffective for correcting behaviour. Why we think adults are different is a simply a lack of love.reply",
      "The distinction between love and attachment is valid, but it does not solve the problem. Even if one defines love as universal, impartial goodwill, it remains aspirational and fragile. To say morality originates only in love is to assume a capacity that human beings rarely sustain in practice. That is precisely why societies construct rules and duties: to create reliable standards even when love fails.The justice system is far from perfect, but dismissing it as a \u201cbrittle imitation\u201d overlooks what it prevents. Most people are not saints. Universal love may be possible in theory, but history shows that in practice societies without enforceable norms often descend into cycles of revenge, corruption, or rule by the strongest. Systems of law are crude, but they are better than trusting every individual to embody unconditional love.Rehabilitation and restorative justice models do exist, and they align with the spirit of love by seeking repair rather than punishment. But they are still structured by rules. Without those, there is no guarantee of fairness or safety. Love can inspire moral action, but rules are what make morality workable in communities of imperfect humans.reply",
      "The issue of love's notorious inconsistency is especially damaging to using it as a foundation of an ethical system. If I acted when I loved something and then decided later on that I didn't love it and would make a different choice, which frame of mind do I use to evaluate the morality of the decision?Philosophers have pretty much torn love apart as a basis for an ethical framework.  It is true we're all very biased and love plays a role in how we perceive but morality has to be based on slightly more objective concepts like fairness, evidence and precedence that we have a chance of evaluating consistently when our feelings change.reply",
      "Yes. Love is mammal behaviour. I know my hind brain is telling me to love my kids. Do you know your own mind?reply",
      "Perfect explanation of why love and reason are often opponents.  We are humans, we have emotion, but alas not all are aware of their own minds.reply",
      "The essay goes into this, clearly means love in a different way to how you've taken it, and doesn't exclude the use of rules to codify it:\"Loving attention: a kind of just, patient, generous attention to others. This, she thinks, is what will improve the moral quality of our vision and put us in touch with reality as it truly is. Loving attention, she insists, is central to morality, and that is because it draws us out of ourselves towards the object of love, overcoming our habitual tendency to turn inward.\"reply",
      "This conception is simplistic, a straw man, and one that appears to be wholly ignorant of the Cosmopolitan tradition and reasonable criticisms thereof.reply",
      "if you make it a rule to do the most horrible things to children and women and men and the elderly, would it then be moral?reply"

She is the author of Iris Murdoch\u2019s Moral Philosophy: Reframing the True, the Real and the Good (forthcoming, OUP).Edited byNigel WarburtonBeing in love is one of the most profound experiences we can have, one that can powerfully move us and irrevocably change the way we see ourselves, one another, and even the wider world. Literature and film often explore romantic love\u2019s capacity to move us and radically alter our world (think of Romeo and Juliet, for instance), but this experience is not limited to romantic love: parents sometimes speak of experiencing overwhelming love at the first sight of their children, for example.On the face of it, this powerful experience has little to do with morality. For many thinkers influenced by Immanuel Kant, there is no place for luck in morality, and accordingly little place for the emotions"

      "I do it more or less this way - except I keep the root intact until the end. It keeps the onion structurally intact until I'm done with the dicing. At which point, the root takes a single chop to lop off, and then the whole thing scatters into tiny, mostly uniform dices. It's quite satisfying.reply",

      "This is silly. I\u2019ve seen Indian street vendors do it the most efficient way. You tilt the knife with the front part down and the back maybe a quarter inch above the surface. That way as you slice the onion the little quarter inch holds it together as you turn it 90 degrees and make the perpendicular set of cuts.reply",
      "That may be the most useful thing I've seen on the internet in months.Thanks much!reply",
      "> It turns out that making horizontal cuts almost never helps with consistency.They made the horizontal cuts evenly spaced between the cutting surface and the top of the onion, which is nonsensical to me. I believe that a single horizontal cut at around 15-20% height would be better for uniformity than a horizontal cut at 50% height.reply",
      "Yeah, that's the way that I cut onions: you make vertical cuts followed by one single horizontal cut slightly above the cutting board.This way of calculating doesn't take into account the creative ways you can make cuts.  You could also do mostly vertical slices, and then slightly angle inwards when you do the final few cuts.  That would get you a more optimal distribution as well.reply",
      "Which is exactly how I was taught to do it while working in kitchens 25 years ago.The other thing is that this seems to ignore that the onion is round in the other direction too. As far as I can see, it only covers the first dice cut.reply"

      "My interpretation of the progress.3.5 to 4 was the most major leap. It went from being a party trick to legitimately useful sometimes. It did hallucinate a lot but I was still able to get some use out of it. I wouldn't count on it for most things however. It could answer simple questions and get it right mostly but never one or two levels deep.I clearly remember 4o was also a decent leap - the accuracy increased substantially. It could answer niche questions without much hallucination. I could essentially replace it with Google for basic to slightly complex fact checking.* 4o was the first time I actually considered paying for this tool. The $20 price was finally worth it.o1 models were also a big leap over 4o (I realise I have been saying big leap too many times but it is true). The accuracy increased again and I got even more confident using it for niche topics. I would have to verify the results much less often. Oh and coding capabilities dramatically improved here in the thinking model. o1 essentially invented oneshotting - slightly non trivial apps could be made just by one prompt for the first time.o3 jump was incremental and so was gpt 5.reply",
      "I have a theory about why it's so easy to underestimate long-term progress and overestimate short-term progress.Before a technology hits a threshold of \"becoming useful\", it may have a long history of progress behind it. But that progress is only visible and felt to researchers. In practical terms, there is no progress being made as long as the thing is going from not-useful to still not-useful.So then it goes from not-useful to useful-but-bad and it's instantaneous progress. Then as more applications cross the threshold, and as they go from useful-but-bad to useful-but-OK, progress all feels very fast. Even if it's the same speed as before.So we overestimate short term progress because we overestimate how fast things are moving when they cross these thresholds. But then as fewer applications cross the threshold, and as things go from OK-to-decent instead of bad-to-OK, that progress feels a bit slowed. And again, it might not be any different in reality, but that's how it feels. So then we underestimate long-term progress because we've extrapolated a slowdown that might not really exist.I think it's also why we see a divide where there's lots of people here who are way overhyped on this stuff, and also lots of people here who think it's all totally useless.reply",

Private equity has been steadily hoovering up these relatively high-margin, low-regulation businesses for the same economic reasons that software companies get big. If you try to create a vet clinic, you will be assimilated or crushed by a bigger player with a brand and the ability to undercut your prices.reply",
      "Is the vet clinic thing a lasting phenomenon? Are independent vet clinics not economically viable or is there just a VC/PE market imbalance where capital is overbidding for a business that doesn't really have a great moat. I would be perfectly willing to believe that if you knock on the door of a perfectly viable business and offer them more than it's worth as well as a salaried position at the new business, (almost) no one says no.I think the cash merry go round will stop eventually because the moat, in as much as there is one, is the vet themselves, not the business. If my vet leaves and opens a new practice, I will follow the person. Vet services don't really scale either, you can hit efficiencies with admin, but I'm sure a software company is willing to eat the PE firm's lunch there. With software, costs are heavily weighted to the fixed side. With vets, seeing twice the number of dogs takes twice the number of vet hours, vet tech hours, etc.reply",
      "Vet clinics have a moat (exactly as you're implying): the customer relationship. That relationship, plus optimization on the fixed costs, gives an incentive to acquire the practice, maintain the staff as employees, and collect the operating margin. It's not like you really care if your favored pet doctor works for Brand A or Brand B, and -- let's be honest -- you're price sensitive. No matter what you say, there's a limit to how much you'll pay in order to follow your favorite vet, because veterinary services are a commodity, and your pet doesn't know the difference. So there's price pressure as well.You're right that vet clinics aren't like software in the variable cost structure, but that just makes the software business more attractive for consolidation, not less. Bigger players will have the customer relationship, lower fixed costs, and high margins, with little threat of competition.reply",
      "> I think the cash merry go round will stop eventually because the moat, in as much as there is one, is the vet themselves, not the business.The moat is the land. It doesn't even matter if it self-owned or a lease.The vet just can't walk away and open a new practice nearby.reply",
      "There's probably a middle ground here. Making a profit ASAP is only really possible if you're selling expertise, such as consulting. I really like the emerging term, \"seed strapping\" which aims to address this conundrum in the startup world: raise just enough to build the first iteration, then act like a bootstrapped business.reply",
      "Yep, totally \u2014 the OG advice was founder-focused. I just couldn\u2019t resist twisting it a bit, because the line itself is too good not to repurpose.reply",

      "> the team took a small sample from the cord\u2019s loose end and used an instrument called a mass spectrometer to measure tiny variations in the hair\u2019s isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Those isotopes hold clues to a person\u2019s diet, such as the amounts of maize and meat they ate in life. Maize, for example, is among the crops that rely on a form of photosynthesis known as C4 photosynthesis, which causes more of the isotope carbon-13 to build up in their tissues than in many other types of plants. Elevated levels of carbon-13 in a hair sample would most likely signal a maize-rich diet, Hyland says. Similarly, a meat-rich diet tends to raise the body\u2019s levels of the isotope nitrogen-15.It's so impressive that we can estimate someone's diet from a hair sample. I had no idea that this was possible.reply",

      "It seems a bit much to stick a Proper Noun in front of Neural Networks and call it a new paradigm.I can see how that worked for KANs because weights and activations are the bread and butter of Neural networks.  Changing the activations kind-of does make a distinct difference.  I still thing there's merit in having learnable weights and activations together, but that's not very Kolmogorov Arnold theorem, so activations only seemed like a decent start point (but I digress).This new thing seems more like just switching out one bit of the toolkit for another.   There are any number of ways to measure how a bunch of values are like another bunch of values.   Cosine similarity, despite sounding all intellectual is just a dot product wearing a lab coat and glasses.  I assume it is easily acknowledged as not the best metric, but really can't be beat for performance if you have a lot of multiply units lying around.It would be worth combining this research with the efforts on translating one embedding model to another.   Transferring between metrics might allow you to pick the most appropriate one at specific times.reply",
      "Interesting, can this be applied to regression?reply",
      "> Another useful property of the model is interpretability.Is this true? my understanding is the hard part about interpreting neural networks is that there are many many neurons, with many many interconnections, not that the activation function itself is not explainable. even with an explainable classifier, how do you explain trillions of them with deep layers of nested connectionsreply",
      "I think the case for interpretability could have been made better, but in Figure 3 I think if you look at the middle \"prototype\" rows from the traditional vs Tversky layers, and scroll so you can't see the rows above, I think you could pick out mostly which Tversky prototype corresponds to each digit, but not which traditional/linear prototype corresponds to each digit.So I do think that's more interpretable in two ways:1. You can look at specific representations in the model and \"see\" what they \"mean\"2. This means you can give a high-level interpretation to a particular inference run: \"X_i is a 7 because it's like this prototype that looks like a 7, and it has some features that only turn up in 7s\"I do think complex models doing complex tasks will sometimes have extremely complex \"explanations\" which may not really communicate anything to a human, and so do not function as an explanation.reply",
      "I've decided 100% of papers saying their modification of a neural network is interpretable are exaggerating.reply",
      "Seems cool, but the image classification model benchmark choice is kinda weak given all the fun tools we have now. I wonder how Tversky probes do on top of DINOv3 for building a classifier for some task.reply",
      "crawl walk run.no sense spending large amounts of compute on algorithms for new math unless you can prove it can crawl.reply",
      "It's the same amount of effort benchmarking, just a better choice of backbone that enables better choices of benchmark tasks. If the claim is that a Tversky projection layer beats a linear projection layer today, then one can test whether that's true with foundation embedding models today.It's also a more natural question to ask, since building projections on top of frozen foundation model embeddings is both common in an absolute sense, and much more common, relatively, than building projections off of tiny frozen networks like a ResNet-50.reply"
