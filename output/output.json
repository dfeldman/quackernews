      "I'm biased, as I lead the Zulip project. But I think this is a reasonable place for me to post some thoughts.Given current events in the USA, I can't emphasize enough how worried one should be about the fact that a few companies like Discord, Google (Gmail), and Meta have databases with access to the private conversations of hundreds of millions of people with their closest friends and family members, linked up with their identity.Some of the big strengths of running a self-hosted Zulip server for your community are:- Zulip servers are operationally simple, highly stable and easy to upgrade.- Zulip is much better than Discord or Slack for managing the firehose of busy communities. Or at least, a lot of people tell us that they prefer the user experience to everything else they've tried, after a few weeks of getting used to it. :)- Your community leaders get to make the policy decisions about data protection, identity, etc.- It's 100% FOSS software, with an extremely readable and maintainable codebase that ~1500 people have successfully contributed code to. I don't think you'll find modern alternatives with a comparable featureset to Discord that are more resilient to the sponsoring company being acquired or going out of business.- We are a values-focused organization (https://zulip.com/values/) where providing a public service is important to us all.- Each server is completely self-contained and independent, with the only centralized services needed from us being desktop/mobile app publication and mobile push notifications delivery (which is free for community use and soon to be E2EE).I'm happy to answer any questions.reply",
      "Because I have some experience with FOSS, I know you don't get the recognition that you deserve. So on behalf of everyone who's too distracted to say thank you.Thank you!Admittedly, it did take a day (less than), but once I got used to the interface Zulip provides. It's better than what I would have asked for! It's phenomenal software! The whole experience is better than anything else that exists. And everyone charging for the same features should feel embarrassed given how much better Zulip is!Genuinely, it's impressive what y'all have created. So thank you!reply",
      "I'm asking because I hate Matrix and actually want you to convince me: why should I accept the risk of migrating my friend group from Discord to Zulip, which has already \"broken the seal\" of restricting features behind a monthly fee even for self-hosted users, when I could migrate us to Matrix instead? Matrix seems like the much less risky option.I see that you have a \"community\" tier that's free and doesn't restrict notifications, but it's not clear to me exactly what's involved in proving that we should qualify.reply",
      "Mobile push notifications are a special case because it's literally not technically possible to self-host them. Or rather, it's possible if you build the iOS and Android apps from source and distribute them through TestFlight or an analogous Android channel, but it's not possible for the developer of an App Store or Play Store app to allow its users to point it at a different push-notification server, because the public key has to be hardcoded in the app binary. So if you want your self-hosted Zulip server to work with the Zulip client apps in the App Store and Play Store, you have to use Zulip's push server, and there's nothing Zulip can do to fix that.Matrix works analogously; if you use the Element app from the App Store or Play Store, then you're using Element's push notification server, even if your Matrix homeserver is self-hosted. It's possible that Element allows their server to be used gratis in situations where Zulip charges a fee, I don't know their policies or anything, but in principle Matrix still leaves you exactly as dependent on a third party's goodwill unless you make your friends install a privately distributed mobile app.Zulip IIUC does not restrict self-hosting of any feature that's technically possible to self-host.reply",
      "But how ntfy does it then? It is one app that allows you to subscribe to multiple different notification endpoints. I have uptime notifications set up this way.Wouldn't it be possible for Zulip to go this route as well?reply",
      "The same way that Element does - they host a service for you that relays push notifications their Firebase Cloud Messaging endpoint for Android or iOS Instant Notifications for Apple. I believe ntfy's hosted option is the way they offset the costs of hosting this, even if self-hosted options can take advantage of those servers free of charge.I think it's reasonable for Zulip to ask for compensation for access to these gateways, since Apple and Google do not make them available to end users free of charge, and the burden of responsibility to ensure that these systems aren't abused is on them. Also, the fact that they offer mobile push notifications for any self hosted server of up to 10 users is pretty generous, and there seems to be a Community plan option for larger servers that includes \"groups of friends\" as a qualifier. It really seems they're offering quite a bit.reply",
      "This isn't true, self-hosted Android push notifications in ntfy are provided using a \"foreground service\" by default (i.e: the app keeps a websocket open and listens), unless you set up firebase for yourself and build a custom version of the app with the cert baked in.https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/phone/#instant-deliveryreply",
      "Because ntfy doesn\u2019t, at least not in a way that detaches you from a central authority.On its own notification to your device will happen eventually when the ntfy app on your phone wakes up and polls. Pull, not push.My ntfy server has a config line for an upstream, which is a service that then uses push. Basically it\u2019s self hosted and handing off push.reply",
      "The default behaviour for self-hosted on Android is to have a foreground service which holds a websocket open, so it does get pushed from the server and doesn't rely on your phone being awake.https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/phone/#instant-deliveryThe upstream approach you describe is only necessary for iOS devices that don't permit apps to do that.https://docs.ntfy.sh/config/#ios-instant-notificationsreply",
      "On Android the OS implementation of \"push\" notifications is pull/poll based as well. At some interval, the OS polls Google's servers to see if there are any messages available.  Firebase essential acts as a message broker, so that it only has to poll a single server, instead of a separate server for every service that wants to send notifications, and there is only a single service polling.But I really wish Android supported specifying additional servers to poll (and/or replace the default server), so you could use a self-hosted service in addition to or instead of Google's service.reply"

      "The challenges mentioned on the article are challenges that are known to every larger distributed system. They are not challenges solved or to be solved by functional programming.But the solutions and tools functional programming provides help to have higher verifiability, fewer side effects and more compile-time checks of code in the deployment unit. That other challenges exists is fully correct. But without a functional approach, you have these challenges plus all others.So while FP is not a one-size-fits-all solution to distributed systems challenges, it does help solve a subset of the challenges on a single system level.reply",
      "> Static types, algebraic data types, making illegal states unrepresentable: the functional programming tradition has developed extraordinary tools for reasoning about programs.But none of these things are functional programming? This is more the tradition of 'expressive static types' than it is of FP.What about Lisp, Racket, Scheme, Clojure, Erlang / Elixir...reply",

And in practice much of the article seems to be about the problems introduced by rigid typing, rather than, say, the problems of map, filter & reduce, etc.Your quote is used in the context of reading old logs using a typed schema if that schema changes, which really doesn't have that much to do with FP.reply",

      "Cool project!The most interesting part, IMO, is the \"SRAM with EEPROM backup\" chip. It allows you to persistently save the clock hands' positions every time they're moved, without burning through the limited write endurance of a plain old EEPROM. And it costs less than $1 in single quantities. That's a useful product to know about.reply",
      "That's really neat.  TIL.So the way this works seems to be this:  It's an SRAM and an EEPROM in one little package along with a controller that talks with each, with a little capacitor (this clock uses 4.7uf) placed nearby.The SRAM part does all of the normal SRAM stuff:  It doesn't wear out from reading/writing, and as long as it has power it retains the data it holds.The EEPROM does all the normal EEPROM stuff:  It stores data forever (on the timescale of an individual human, anyway), but has somewhat-limited write cycles.The controller:  When it detects a low voltage, it goes \"oh shit!\" and immediately dumps the contents of the SRAM into EEPROM.  This saves on EEPROM write cycles:  If there are no power events, the EEPROM is never written at all.Meanwhile, the capacitor:  It provides the power for the chip to perform this EEPROM write when an \"oh shit!\" event occurs.When power comes back, the EEPROM's data is copied back to SRAM.---Downsides?  This 47L04 only holds 4 kilobits.  Upsides?  For hobbyist projects and limited production runs, spending $1 to solve a problem is ~nothing.  :)reply",
      "Has anyone found the chip on AliExpress? I only get unrelated listings with that part number, but this is a pretty interesting chip I'd like to get a few of.An alternative would be a supercapacitor and a voltage divider connected to the ADC pin of the microcontroller. When the 5V rail dies, the supercapacitor can hold 3.3V for a few seconds while you write everything to the EEPROM.reply",

That gave me a very easy place to start, so I started.I read up on it a bit using the datasheet and a whitepaper.

      "I got one of those dongles from my insurance company that plugged into the ODB2 port and reported my driving habits.I was a bad driver. It would frequently beep at me to let me know that I had braked too hard. I was mystified. \"What should I have done differently,\" I'd think, as I raged at the objective machine that judged me so.The next time my brother came to visit, he called mom. \"Oh, and presidentender is a good driver now.\" I didn't put the pieces together right away, but it turned out that the dongle had actually trained me, like a dog's shock collar.The reason for my too-frequent hard-braking events wasn't speed, although that would be a contributing factor. It was a lack of appropriate following distance. Because I'd follow the drivers in front of me too closely I'd have to brake hard if they did... Or if they drive normally and happened to have a turn coming up.Over the period I had the insurance spy box in my truck I learned without thinking about it to increase my following distance, which meant that riding with me as a passenger was more comfortable and it beeped less often. Of course since I'd been so naughty early during the evaluation they didn't decrease my rates, but I think the training probably did make me statistically less likely to crash.reply",
      "Maintaining a safe following distance is incredibly challenging on busy freeways where hard braking is often 'required'. Most people have likely found themselves in this situation: vehicle changes lanes in front of you; you slow down to maintain a safe following distance, another car sees a gap and changes lanes in front of you. Repeat for your entire commute.Incredibly frustrating, and I've driven all over North America - there's practically no major city where this doesn't happen. If you're not maintaining a safe following distance on city/residential streets, that's a different matter.reply",
      "> vehicle changes lanes in front of you;I will never understand why this is so rage-inducing for people.Changing lanes is a necessary part of navigating, even during busy traffic.  People on an on-ramp will need to get in front of somebody.  People needing to move back to the right because their exist is coming up will need to get in front of somebody.Your lane is not a birth right.  Let people merge.>  you slow down to maintain a safe following distance, another car sees a gap and changes lanes in front of you. Repeat for your entire commute.This happens because literally everyone is tailgating each other so hard that the gap in front of you is the only gap that exists for people to change lanes to either get on or off the highway.reply",
      "It's frustrating because someone is taking your safety buffer as their opportunity to travel faster. And it results in you having to travel slower and slower to maintain the gap that is constantly consumed, tragedy of the commons style, by opportunists.reply",
      "It seems like a tragedy, but actually it can be a boon as long as you travel in neither the leftmost nor rightmost lane. The majority of the traffic entering your buffer will be exiting your buffer out the other side as soon as they can, so you can just chug along at a (greatly reduced, but) consistent speed. Meanwhile, the traffic to either side of you is in standstill, paralyzed by your bow wake.reply",
      "It's wild to me how often the left lane is not the fastest lane.I've had times where the right lane ends up being the fastest.  On I-5 near Woodburn, OR, it's 3 lanes.  So many drivers, including truckers, will often stay out of the right lane entirely to avoid being caught up in traffic coming on/off.  Meanwhile, the left lane is going 5 mph under the limit because there's a left-lane camper somewhere miles ahead.  So I can fly past everybody in the right lane because there's actually barely any traffic coming on/off and everybody is avoiding the right lane for no reason at all.reply",
      "> On I-5 near Woodburn, ORThe section of I-5 between Portland and Salem is absolutely psychotic, and I have never been able to reason out exactly why.  It consistently has a left lane jammed with angry people going at or below the speed limit, a fairly normal center lane filled with cruisers, and a mostly empty right lane with the occasional big rig and regular very-high-speed cars expressing their frustration with the left lane by going 25+ mph over the limit in the right lane.I know that's what you basically just said.  Just venting.  The driver behavior in that section of freeway confounds me, and I do not know what the underlying cause is.  It is otherwise an unremarkable bit of interstate like any other.reply",
      "It's wild to me that it's allowed and accepted to overtake on the right on US highways.reply",
      "Truckers sometimes have a good reason to do that -- they can't brake or accelerate as quickly as a small vehicle, and thus can end up going very slowly if they stick with the right lane. To a driver going 3 exits down the 205 it's not a big deal, to a truck driver doing the same they may be at the end of a long haul up the I5 and every minute starts to count since it can affect their pay. And if you can avoid hard braking/hard acceleration in the right lane, that can help your fuel costs quite a bit since slowly coasting behind someone doing 5 under in the left lane is more efficient than jerking around in the right lane.There are plenty of ramps on I5 and 205 that I merge to the left for because I know they will spill into the right and (when it exists) middle lanes. Because of how traffic also reacts to brake lights (some people brake too hard even when they have sufficient distance to let off the gas and coast to a slower speed) it seems like it ends up making my experience through those stretches a bit better.Ultimately, any individual behaviour is largely irrelevant, it's what the whole mass of cars moving along does that affects things the most. Often you don't want to be the (significantly) odd one out regardless of the situation.reply",

      "> When we pack high-density information into a data table or a complex dashboard we are increasing the visual entropy of the entire system. Forcing the brain to decode intricate, non-universal shapes in a tiny 16-pixel footprint, creates a \u201ccognitive tax\u201d that users pay en masse every time they scan the table.What if it's an icon with a simple shape? How does that compare to noising up the table with long phrases and repetitive words? Is the cognitive tax if icons a lot higher or just a little higher? What if it's an app where the user will be using it for hours, so they'll quickly learn what the icons mean and will appreciate the space they save?Is a tick icon really that big a deal in place of \"Task completed\"? Or a pencil instead of \"Edit\"? Sometimes you don't have a choice because of lack of space too. There's always tradeoffs to make. Obviously try to avoid icons that are hard to guess though but sometimes that's not always possible.I can't say I've ever felt tired looking at icons in a table, but when designing I have had the experience of replacing wordy repetitive text with some intuitive icons in a complex table and it suddenly looking less intimidating.reply",
      "Right, this article overlooks the difference between a first encounter and regular encounters. The concise representation pays off when you do learn it, as long as it's executed well.And I'm fine with a bit of cognitive exploration to figure out a green check and red X scheme rather than see a whole table column filled up with words like \"active\" and \"inactive\". The former allows more columns on screen at once. Horizontal scrolling is a worse impediment to assimilating information from a table.reply",
      "I would almost always rather have the words; words are things I can easily search for and manipulate using the text-processing tools in my possession.Personally, my brain \"page faults\" whenever it has to interpret an emoji, which makes most use of in-line icons far worse than the text they represent. I expect few people have this problem, but I also expect that I'm not the only one with it.reply",
      "My gut feel (personal experience, not research) is that the whole of the icons' nature is important. Them having simple shapes doesn't necessarily solve the problem and could in some cases make it worse.Imagine for example a set of icons that are monochrome, open-ended glyphs comprised of a single stroke with line weight similar to that of the text. This could complicate visual parsing greatly due to high visual similarity to text.On the other hand, a 16px checkbox control with subtle gradients, shadows, and depth cues looks absolutely nothing like text and is filtered out by the brain almost automatically (unless of course the checkbox state is pertinent to the user's intent). Same goes for a 16px colorful icon with shading like used to be ubiquitous in desktop operating systems.reply",
      "The box itself around a data table label could hint at a state, if the goal is to define only a handful of states (green rounded capsule for a completed state; diamond capsule for an in-progress condition; red square for an error; purple parallelogram for some special condition; etc).Not sure how this is for accessibility in terms of colour selection, but I\u2019m sure this could be fine-tuned.reply",
      "I wrote about something very similar a long time ago.[0]The key problem is that most contemporary web design does not follow any idioms. Idioms are conventions of design that are universally understood. Skillful use of idioms makes it much easier to parse what is going on on a given page.Where we are with most applications is that they try to define their own idioms, i.e. their own icons, their own navigation patterns, etc. But this is very arrogant because they're assuming that the user has the time to build that familiarity with all those idioms. This is never the case.Every day I use web applications from nominally mature companies, and they have totally different icon sets for the same actions. This is immensely distracting and hard to read.

      "> The originals sound better. The aliasing provides a crunchiness and sharpness to the final output that drives emotional energy.In the mid-1980s the first really affordable sampler was the Ensoniq Mirage, which used the Bob Yannes-designed ES5503 DOC (Digital Oscillator Chip) to generate its waveforms. It played back 8-bit samples and used a fairly simple phase accumulator that didn't do any form of interpolation (I don't count \"leftmost neighbour\" as interpolation). Particularly when you pitch it down, you get a rough, clanky, gritty \"whine\" to samples, that the analogue filters didn't necessarily do a lot to remove.Later on they released the EPS which had 13-bit sampling. Why 13-bit? I don't know, I guess because the Emulator I and II used 8-bit samples but \u03bc-law coding, giving effectively 13-bit equivalent resolution. It also used linear interpolation to smooth the \"jumps\" between samples, and even if you loaded in and converted a Mirage disk the \"graininess\" when you pitched things down was gone.I'm currently writing some code to play back Mirage samples from disk images, and I've actually added a linear interpolator to it. Some things sound better with it, some things sound worse. I think I'll make it a front panel control, so you can turn it on and off as you want.reply",

Otherwise you were stuck with 3 or maybe 4 hardware voices. e.g. the timbre and filter of the C64 SID chip was gorgeous (another Bob Yannes design), but 3 voices was all you got.

      "Static inline functions can sometimes serve as an optimisation barrier to compilers. Its very annoying. I've run into a lot of cases when targeting C as a compilation target where swapping something out into an always-inline function results in worse code generation, because compilers have bugs sadlyThere's also the issue in that the following two things don't have the same semantics in C:    float v = a * b + c;\n\nvs    static_inline float get_thing(float a, float b) {\n        return a*b;\n    }\n\n    float v = get_thing(a, b) + c;\n\nThis is just a C-ism (floating point contraction) that can make extracting things into always inlined functions still be a big net performance negative. The C spec mandates it sadly!uintptr_t's don't actually have the same semantics as pointers either. Eg if you write:    void my_func(strong_type1* a, strong_type2* b);\n\na =/= b, and we can pull the underlying type out. However, if you write:    void my_func(some_type_that_has_a_uintptr_t1 ap, some_type_that_has_a_uintptr_t2 bp) {\n        float* a = get(ap);\n        float* b = get(bp);\n    }\n\na could equal b. Semantically the uintptr_t version doesn't provide any aliasing semantics. Which may or may not be what you want depending on your higher level language semantics, but its worth keeping the distinction in mind because the compiler won't be able to optimise as wellreply",
      "`uintptr_t` and `intptr_t` are integer types large enough to hold a pointer. They're not pointer types (They're also optional in the standard).In the first `my_func`, there is the possiblity that `a` and `b` are equal if their struct layouts are equivalent (or one has a proper subset of the other's fields in the same order). To tell the compiler they don't overlap we would use `(strong_type1 *restrict a, strong_type2 *restrict b)`.There's also the possibility that the pointers could point to the same address but be non-equal - eg if LAM/UAI/TBI are enabled, a simple pointer equality comparison is not sufficient because the high bits may not be equal. Or on platforms where memory access is always aligned, the low bits may be not equal. These bits are sometimes used to tag pointers with additional information.reply",
      "The inline function receives the operands as arguments, and so whatever they are, they get converted to float. Thus the inline code is effectively like this:  float v = (float) ((float) a) * ((float) b) + c;\n\nSince v is float, the cast representing the return conversion can be omitted:  float v = ((float) a) * ((float) b) + c;\n\nNow, if a and b are already float, then it's equivalent. Otherwise not; if they are double or int, we get double or int multiplication in the original open code.reply",
      "> Now, if a and b are already float, then it's equivalent.Not necessarily! Floating-point contraction is allowable essentially within statements but not across them. By assigning the result of a * b into a value, you prohibit contraction from being able to contract with the addition into an FMA.In practice, every compiler has fast-math flags which says stuff it and allows all of these optimizations to occur across statements and even across inline boundaries.(Then there's also the issue of FLT_EVAL_METHOD, another area where what the standard says and what compilers actually do are fairly diametrically opposed.)reply",
      "The first mention of contraction in the standard (I'm looking at N3220 draft that I have handy) is:A floating expression may be contracted, that is, evaluated as though it were a single opera-\ntion, thereby omitting rounding errors implied by the source code and the expression evalua-\ntion method.86) The FP_CONTRACT pragma in <math.h> provides a way to disallow contracted\nexpressions. Otherwise, whether and how expressions are contracted is implementation-defined.If you're making a language that generates C, it's probably a good idea to pin down which C compilers are supported, and control the options passed to them. Then you can more or less maintain the upper hand on issues like this.reply",
      "It seems to me that either you want to allow for contraction everywhere, or not all. Allowing it only sometimes is worst of both worlds.reply",
      "If you allow contraction after inlining, whether or not an FMA will get contracted becomes subject to the vicissitudes of inlining and other compiler decisions that can be hard-to-predict. It turns out to be a lot harder of a problem to solve than it appears at first glance.reply",
      "Compiler bugs and standards warts suck, but you know what sucks more? Workarounds for compiler bugs and edge cases that become pessimizing folk wisdom that we can dispell only after decades, if ever. It took about that long to convince the old guards of various projects that we could have inline functions instead of macros. I don't want to spook them into renewed skepticism.reply",

      "There has to be, since it seems to consist of what I assume are fairly straightforward parameters in the URL that encode position and direction.Looking online, it seems to be:  https://earth.google.com/web/@<lat>,<lon>,<alt>a,<range>d,<fov>y,<heading>h,<tilt>t,<roll>r\n\nwhere <range> is the \"distance from camera to target point\".Apparently the tricky part is placing a pin, which belongs to an encoded /data= parameter, and from what I gather nobody's discovered how to set that data.It seems that it might be possible to dynamically generate a KML file which defines everything (including pins) using markup, but it's not clear if there's a way to pass that or encode it in a single link to Google Earth (as opposed to the user having to manually load it once in Google Earth). Google Maps is basically the same as Google Earth in the web interface, so there might be a way to do these things there.So it's definitely possible to do something, but figuring out exactly how far you can go might take some experimentation.reply",
      "Thanks!That imgur link is great, I totally see what you mean. So surely there is a way to at least automate linking to these views? I don't know about embedding them cos Google will want money. We're very open to suggestions, and PRs of course! https://github.com/AllTheLines/viewviewreply",
      "I had a slightly different question (that wasn't googleable), that you may be able to answer with the data you have.... What two points on earth are furthest from each other when taking into account the earth is an ellipsoid? I'm guessing Chimborazo and whatever is diametrically opposed to it, but is there anything else that's close?reply",
      "There aren't that many antipodes on land. It is mainly South America to Southeast and East Asia. With New Zealand to Spain.Chimborazo's antipode is Sumatra. That may be the best, unless there is peak in Indonesia that lines up with Andes in Columbia.reply"
