      "My time to shine! I still own an early square body truck with the 6.2L Detroit Diesel. The thing that stands out to me in this article is that the Suburbans shown are an earlier generation produced from 67-72. Those did not have a Diesel engine, however the 6.2L Detroit Diesel was designed to drop into anything with a Small Block Chevy, so I can see how these may have been retrofitted. In fact, these engines are still produced today in 6.5L form (see the AM General Optimizer) and are used in the HMMWV.These really are very simplistic engines and simplistic vehicles in general. Mine has power nothing, at least electronically. The shifter really is comically large and very inconvenient to whoever sits in the middle. The highest gear is third gear.Powerful? No, not really. But surprisingly efficient for the size. Reliable as well.\n \nreply",

The DNA is usually highly degraded, which limits the analyses to short read sequencing (in this case they used 76 bp reads). The halflife of human DNA is ~521 years.To mitigate these problems they used multiple targeted approaches including one to isolate mitochondrial DNA, where they managed to sequence the whole ~16kb human mtDNA, where each base was covered by 62 sequencing reads on average (62x coverage).They used another to isolate specific regions containing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are DNA mismatches known to be related to ancient human DNA and humans.  They targeted 470,724 single nucleotide polymorphisms of which 70% (336,429) were recovered.They did perform shotgun sequencing on all of the DNA isolated, but due to species assignment issues they again focused on fragments that contain diagnostic SNPs in these cases they only recovered a small number of SNPs per sample, again due to the relatively low proportion of human DNA and its degradation (20,526, 3,734, 124,862, 85,901, 34,756, 41,632, 34,677 and 72,992) as per the legend in figure 3.\n \nreply",

I went to school in Abingdon, Oxon, which is where the Morris Garage comes from.  My car didn't!There is a standard for range - WLTP - does the US subscribe to it?  The W stands for Worldwide.My car has a WLTP range of 323 miles.  I've managed better than that.  The standard itself is pretty decent and far better than the old one.EVs are different to ICEs.  Mind you they are both pretty efficient at around 50mph - funny that.  EVs hate cold but if you pre-heat the battery, then its not so bad.  An ICE can always have a bigger tank and you can easily pop a 15l can in the boot (trunk) to grab an extra 50 miles or so.  EVs don't have that flexibility.However, I pay 7p per KWh to charge my car and I fuel up at home instead of at Tesco.  My \"tank\" costs about \u00a35 and I can get about 300 miles out of it.My other car (Renault Clio) costs about \u00a370 at the moment (it has been far worse) to fuel up and I'll get roughly 700 miles out of it.In Europe I think that EV vs !EV is almost certainly won but I do get that in the Americas, where it can get proper chilly at times and the distances involved can be huge means that an EV might not be indicated without a lot of caveats.  EVs mostly do cost more too for the initial purchase, which isn't helpful.Despite all that, do note I routinely pay roughly \u00a35 for 300 miles, and I don't have to piss around with garages.

      "How can Tesla advertise a \u201cmore accurate\u201d number if they are required by regulation to use EPA estimate?EPA range estimates being inaccurate is a real problem. They do not, and are not designed to, give actual expected range. It\u2019s meant to be an \u201caverage\u201d of \u201cmixed\u201d driving.Take latest Model Y as example. If you compare EPA range vs WLTP (commonly used in EU)327mi EPA est. (526km) US version (long range) /\n586km WLTP est. (364mi) EU version (long range)The WLTP is \u201caverage\u201d as well, so which of these is more accurate?This problem is not unique to Teslas, and actually not unique to EVs either. It\u2019s just more noticeable, as ICE vehicles usually advertise MPG and tank size, not total range. So EVs suffer from their own advertisement highlighting numbers that will never be accurate.\n \nreply",

      "It isn't super harmful to occasionally use the full capacity for longer road-trip type situations, but it is indeed slightly better for long-term (100k+ mile) battery health to keep it in the 10-80% range most of the time.

      "A optimized version would use 64-bit accumulators (`psadbw` on SSE2, or some sort of horizontal adds on NEON). The `255` max constraint is pointless.Many programming languages/frameworks expose this operation as `reduce()`.\n \nreply",
      "Reduce does not accept a predicate.\n \nreply",

      "Some people already mentioned this in the r/cpp discussion. Small correction: 256 is not the correct number of iterations, since if all elements in that slice are even, then your 8-bit counter will wrap-around to zero, which can lead to a wrong answer. What you want is 255 iterations.I've looked at the generated assembly for such a solution and it doesn't look great. I'm expecting a significant speed penalty, but I haven't had the time to test it today. Will probably do so tomorrow.\n \nreply",
      "255 is not ideal either because it results in a partial vector at the end of either 15 or 31 elements. 256-V where V is the vector size is better, so 240 for SSE2/NEON or 224 for AVX2.This is still lower than optimal because the compiler will reduce to a uint8. Both SSE2 and NEON support reducing to a wider value by _mm_sad_epu8 and vpadal_u8, respectively. This allows for 255 iterations in the inner loop instead of 15 or 7.\n \nreply",

      "Wow! Incredibly fascinated to see 1957 tech make such fascinating animations! It\u2019s so time consuming. Imagine the patience to take those pictures frame by frame\n \nreply",
      "You can go see one in person, it sticks through the floor of the Disney Family Museum in the Presidio. There is lots of animation history in that building. If you just wanna see the camera the top part pokes into the gift shop which you don't need admission to go into\n \nreply",
      "I highly enjoy watching these old instructional documentaries even if the tech is obsolete by now. There\u2019s something that makes old tech a lot more graspable as a concept even if you\u2019re not familiar with the technology.\n \nreply",
      "It's worth pointing out that Walt was one of the inventors of this camera, as well as all his other roles in making the company's art. Concepts we have today like Photoshop layers and CSS stacking contexts are direct descendants of this invention.\n \nreply",

      "I wonder when and why they stopped making films like these.  I've been enjoying watching Behind the Attraction and The Imagineering Story on Disney+ with my kids.  They are full of these old films of Walt going over their ideas and explaining the things they are and have built.  It's a shame that stopped.\n \nreply",
      "You can see one of these multiplane cameras on display at the Walt Disney Family Museum in the Presidio of San Francisco.\n \nreply",
      "There is also a display of one in Orlando, I believe at Magic Kindgom.\n \nreply",
      "It\u2019s in Walt Disney Presents at Hollywood Studios. There is a bunch more Disney models and memorabilia inside as well. Feels like a hidden gem because it\u2019s always pretty empty, plus there is even a character meet and greet with little wait.\n \nreply"

      "I went to the trouble of finding monthly egg production totals for the US based on \"NASS quick stats.\"https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/80AF9DAE-99AE-31D0-...Hopefully yall can make heads or tails of the data.The querying tool is also linked at\nhttps://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/#80AF9DAE-99AE-31D0-8F1C-EC...\n \nreply",
      "First of all I think this article was put together quite well, it was succinct had a great flow and was very easy to follow. The data was laid out to support the case; overall it was great to read.Understanding a problem requires a holistic view of the larger system. An egg producer may say prices are higher Because supply is lower due to culling. Part of that statement is true. The author then zooms out to better understand the larger system.The truth of a matter deviates significantly from one party\u2019s assertions.it\u2019s scary to me that people lack the skills, the desire or incentives to understand and objectively seek understanding of what\u2019s happening around us especially in highly charged US political landscape. This isn\u2019t like pure scientific pursuit of knowledge but a more practical day to day ability to question, understand and gather new information with the purpose of developing an objective understanding of the world.\n \nreply",
      "> Understanding a problem requires a holistic view of the larger system.It does, but the result is extremely uncomfortable.  And the solving it will require actions that are even more uncomfortable.You have to come to grips with the fact that there are monopolies at every single level.  There is no inventory anywhere except bottom.  There is no over capacity at any level.Consequently, supply and demand simply do not work.  There is no \"excess supply\" to use to make extra profit by eating the extra demand.  There is no upstart supplier who can absorb the extra demand.  The big suppliers can ratchet up prices with zero consequences.  What are you gonna do about it?> it\u2019s scary to me that people lack the skills, the desire or incentives to understand and objectively seek understanding of what\u2019s happening around us especially in highly charged US political landscape.They don't lack the skills.  They have chosen to treat politics like sportsball rather than something to actively think about.\n \nreply",
      ">\"The big suppliers can ratchet up prices with zero consequences. What are you gonna do about it?\"I think one (uncomfortable) solution is this. Consumers should budget their expenses. So when the egg prices increase, they should consume less to maintain their budget for eggs, for example, a month.This will mean that when the companies increases prices, more of their stock will remain unsold, increasing their expenses stocking them to go up. This could also cause disruptions on their supply chain. This should force them to reduce prices.\n \nreply",

Americans on average have way more space to mess around in than say most Europeans - the place is fucking huge.  Chickens are very easy to \"grow your own\".I'm not an American and clearly you have managed to get your collective knickers in a twist over a non issue, which almost certainly means that there is a bigger picture and a rather more important issue that really needs fixing.Please stop fiddling whilst Rome burns.\n \nreply",

Why?Argument-dependent lookup.If you make a function call through an unqualified name, the compiler starts by looking for a matching class member, a function declaration in block scope, or a non-function. In our case, there is no invoke that matches any of those criteria, so we keep going. (The winrt::impl::invoke is in namespace scope, not block scope.)Next, argument-dependent lookup identifies a bunch of namespaces that should be part of the search. For each argument, the namespace containing the type of that argument is added, the class the type is contained in (if it is a nested typ"
