On paper it should be a good thing; being publicly owned should mean that your corporation has turned from a private business venture into effectively public infrastructure that's impossible to boycott and depended on to some extent by everybody. As a result, financial statements should be (and are) public and transparent, and the company should be able to be externally steered via regular elections in a manner that benefits the public and not just its founders.The issue really lies in the fact that the (long-term, majority) shareholders aren't much, if at all, related to the customers or employees of the business, but first the founders, and then parties who are merely interested in rising stock prices and dividends. It feels like the solution here ought to somehow desegregate voting rights from how many shares are owned, instead of dismantling the concept of public ownership entirely.

Sure the actual bug ended up being (what I imagine to be) a <1hr fix plus the time for QA testing to make sure it didn't break anything.Is the issue that people aren't checking their security@ email addresses? People are on holiday? These emails get so much spam it's really hard to separate the noise from the legit signal? I'm genuinely curious.reply",
      "In my experience, it comes down to project management and organizational structure problems.Companies hire a \"security team\" and put them behind the security@ email, then decide they'll figure out how to handle issues later.When an issue comes in, the security team tries to forward the security issue to the team that owns the project so it can be fixed. This is where complicated org charts and difficult incentive structures can get in the way.Determining which team actually owns the code containing the bug can be very hard, depending on the company. Many security team people I've worked with were smart, but not software developers by trade. So they start trying to navigate the org chart to figure out who can even fix the issue. This can take weeks of dead-ends and \"I'm busy until Tuesday next week at 3:30PM, let's schedule a meeting then\" delays.Even when you find the right team, it can be difficult to get them to schedule the fix. In companies where roadmaps are planned 3 quarters in advance, everyone is focused on their KPIs and other acronyms, and bonuses are paid out according to your ticket velocity and on-time delivery stats (despite PMs telling you they're not), getting a team to pick up the bug and work on it is hard. Again, it can become a wall of \"Our next 3 sprints are already full with urgent work from VP so-and-so, but we'll see if we can fit it in after that\"Then legal wants to be involved, too. So before you even respond to reports you have to flag the corporate counsel, who is already busy and doesn't want to hear it right now.So half or more of the job of the security team becomes navigating corporate bureaucracy and slicing through all of the incentive structures to inject this urgent priority somewhere.Smart companies recognize this problem and will empower security teams to prioritize urgent things. This can cause another problem where less-than-great security teams start wielding their power to force everyone to work on not-urgent issues that get spammed to the security@ email all day long demanding bug bounties, which burns everyone out. Good security teams will use good judgment, though.reply",
      "Oh man this is so true. In this sort of org, getting something fixed out-of-band takes a huge political effort (even a critical issue like having your client database exposed to the world).reply"

      "I'm sad.  I'm a software guy, not much of a hardware expert, so please bear with me if I\"m too pessimistic.  However, I feel that if trends like this continue, it might be the end of enthusiast-level personal computing as we know it.  No more being able to head down to the electronics store and purchase RAM, motherboards, processors, GPUs, storage, and other components.  We're going to be limited to locked-down terminals connected to cloud services, both of which provided by a small number of multinational corporations.  If we're lucky, we might still have USB peripherals.The sad thing is that we enthusiasts are a small market compared to the overwhelming majority of computer users who don't mind locked-down devices, or at least until they've been bitten by the restrictions, but if there are no alternatives other than retrocomputing, then it's too late.  For decades we enthusiasts have been able to benefit from other markets with overlapping needs such as gaming, workstations, and corporate servers.  However, many on-premise servers have been replaced by cloud services, the workstation market has been subsumed by the broader PC market, and PC gaming has faced challenges, from a push toward locked-down consoles to challenges in the GPU market due to competition with cryptocurrency mining and now AI.One of the things I'm increasingly disappointed with is the dominance of large corporations in computing.  It seems harder for small players to survive in this ecosystem.  Software has to deal with network effects and large companies owning major platforms, and building your own hardware requires tons of capital.I wonder if it's possible even for a company to make even 1980s-era electronics without massive capital expenditures?  How feasible is it for a small company to manufacture the equivalent of a Motorola 68000 or Intel 386?I'd like to see a market for hobbyist computing by hobbyist computer shops, but I'm not sure it's economically feasible.reply",
      "I've seen things going the opposite way.  It's only recently that an average person could jump on eBay and get assembled low-level electronic module/boards for cheap, and assemble into their project.Yes, you'll probably have difficulty walking into a STORE to buy PC components, but only because online shopping has been killing local shops for decades now.  You'll find it easy to get that stuff online, for better prices.PCs, since the very start, have been going through a process of being ever more integrated each generation.  Not too many people install sound cards, IDE controllers, etc., anymore.  CPUs, GPUs, and RAM are about the only holdouts not integrated on the motherboard these days.  It's possible that could change, if CPUs and GPUs becomes fast enough for 99% of people, and RAM gets cheap enough that manufacturers can put more on-board than 99% of people will need.  And while you might not be happy about that kind of integration, it comes with big price reductions that help everyone.  But we're not there yet, and I can't say how long down the road that might be.reply",
      "Not my experience. I've been able to go to a local store to buy PC components for more than 35 years now and last did to upgrade the RAM in the laptop to be eligible for Win11. Online only was not cheaper and local store had it available same day. Local store does have online presence and is a chain tho.Mouse replacement on a weekend coz old one broke same story (button smashed in and not usable at all any longer). Online not cheaper, no same day available at any price, Amazon delivery without Prime no next day either. Local chain store had it for immediate pickup and I was gaming again in 30 minutes.reply",
      "At this point it's getting ridiculously easy to justify the acquisition of such manufactory - I wonder if there are existing players in other categories (be it hardware or even software) that are considering about trying to get into this field. I mean - I get it that someone like OVH may not have the caps yet to handle something like this - but I wouldn't be surprised if they could find a good company to partner with - same is for pretty much everywhere.I'm really wondering about hardware as well but today's tech is surprising in it's scale and requirements - I wouldn't be surprised if we could do mid 70's tech as hobbyist today - but further than that...reply",
      "Wow. They're not selling off the business, they're totally exiting it.This is a big loss. Crucial offered a supply chain direct from Micron. Most other consumer DRAM sources pass through middlemen, where fake parts and re-labeled rejects can be inserted.reply",

      "Wondering if we're going to have a situation in the future where we end up having to buy the hand-me-downs from industry after they're done with them (and thus kind of outdated tech)? Kind of seems like the days of building your own PC are numbered.reply",
      "This is already happening in the NAS HDD space. Prices on new units have been stagnant or rising for a couple years now.reply",
      "Even the hand-me-down situation has been changing.  I remember in the 2010s being able to shop at Weird Stuff in Sunnyvale, which was a treasure trove of old enterprise equipment, a heavenly place for a retrocomputing enthusiast like me.  I even bought accessories for my NeXTstation there!  The shop kept the good retro stuff in the back away from the general public for people who asked kindly about retro gear :).  I saw some 1980s and 1990s classic Macs, too, in the restricted area.Unfortunately Weird Stuff is a thing of the past, though this had less to do with a reduced supply of surplus and more to do with Silicon Valley\u2019s high real estate prices.  Thankfully there are still good stuff to be found at e-waste recyclers, but if more companies are relying on the cloud, and if more devices are integrated boards with everything soldered on (such as most modern Apple hardware), the hand-me-downs of the future are going to be harder to work on than today\u2019s hand-me-downs.  I\u2019m just an average software guy whose hardware experience is limited to a graduate-level computer architecture course and building PCs.  I can talk about caching and branch prediction, but I\u2019ve never picked up a soldering iron in my life; I\u2019m no Louis Rossmann.reply",

      "This vulnerability is basically the worst-case version of what people have been warning about since RSC/server actions were introduced.The server was deserializing untrusted input from the client directly into module+export name lookups, and then invoking whatever the client asked for (without verifying that metadata.name was an own property).    return moduleExports[metadata.name]\n\n\nWe can patch hasOwnProperty and tighten the deserializer, but there is deeper issue. React never really acknowledged that it was building an RPC layer. If you look at actual RPC frameworks like gPRC or even old school SOAP, they all start with schemas, explicit service definitions and a bunch of tooling to prevent boundary confusion. React went the opposite way: the API surface is whatever your bundler can see, and the endpoint is whatever the client asks for.My guess is this won't be the last time we see security fallout from that design choice. Not because React is sloppy, but because it\u2019s trying to solve a problem category that traditionally requires explicitness, not magic.reply",
      "To me it just looks like unacceptable carelessness, not an indictment of the alleged \"lack of explicitness\" versus something like gRPC. Explicit schemas aren't going to help you if you're so careless that, right at the last moment, you allow untrusted user input to reference anything whatsoever in the server's name space.reply",
      "But once that particular design decision is made it is a question of time before that happens. The one enables the other.The fact that React embodies an RPC scheme in disguise is quite obvious if you look at the kind of functionality that is implemented, some of that simply can not be done any other way. But then you should own that decision and add all of the safeguards that such a mechanism requires, you can't bolt those on after the fact.reply",
      "The endpoint is not whatever the client asks for. It's marked specifically as exposed to the user with \"use server\". Of course the people who designed this recognize that this is designing an RPC system.A similar bug could be introduced in the implementation of other RPC systems too. It's not entirely specific to this design.(I contribute to React but not really on RSC.)reply",

      "There's an amazing way to derive Maxwell's equations, and the equations for 3 of the other fundamental forces of nature, directly from Lie group symmetry. You try to write down a theory that is symmetric under -local- symmetry transformations, meaning that the theory should give the same predictions even if you rotate (in some abstract space that you tack into the theory) by an angle that depends on position arbitrarily. At first this seems impossible, because any derivatives with respect to position will depend on the spatial variation of the rotation angle. But if you add an additional field that subtracts off the variation in the rotation angle, you find that this field is a dynamical object that coincides with the electromagnetic field! (Or to be more correct, it's the vector potential, which is directly related to electric and magnetic fields).So there's some strange sense in which these laws of nature seem to arise from, or are at least deeply connected to geometry.reply",
      "Indeed you can use symmetry, but it feels more like a mathematical hack, and the fact that it agrees with reality could be a coincidence. You can state that, and there is a lot of evidence for, that nature follows some basic geometrical rules. Applying that through a Lie theory framework on a symplectic manifold to see how charges behave differentially will eventually get you to Maxwell equations because of how those Lie algebras operate. However for me the real revelation was just using the Lienard\u2013Wiechert approach to calculate how charged particles should behave in a relativistic field, which is as simple as it gets, and then see that you can build the full electromagnetic theory on top of that, with the bonus that the formulation is already relativistic. The same resulting symmetry in a corresponding Lie group is consequence of that (nicely captured by Hodge's equation), and invariance or operator rules don't need to be forced.reply",

      "Ex-Google here; there are many people both current and past-Google that feel the same way as the composite coworker in the linked post.I haven't escaped this mindset myself. I'm convinced there are a small number of places where LLMs make truly effective tools (see: generation of \"must be plausible, need not be accurate\" data, e.g. concept art or crowd animations in movies), a large number of places where LLMs make apparently-effective tools that have negative long-term consequences (see: anything involving learning a new skill, anything where correctness is critical), and a large number of places where LLMs are simply ineffective from the get-go but will increasingly be rammed down consumers' throats.Accordingly I tend to be overly skeptical of AI proponents and anything touching AI. It would be nice if I was more rational, but I'm not; I want everyone working on AI and making money from AI to crash and burn hard. (See also: cryptocurrency)reply",
      "My friends and I have always wondered as we've gotten older what's going to be the new tech that the younger generation seems to know and understand innately while the older generations remain clueless and always need help navigating (like computers/internet for my parents' generation and above). I am convinced that thing is AI.Kids growing up today are using AI for everything, whether or not that's sanctioned or if it's ultimately helpful or harmful to their intellectual growth. I think the jury is still out on that. But I do remember growing up in the 90s, spending a lot of time on the computer, older people would remark how I'll have no social skills, I won't be able to write cursive or do arithmetic in my head, won't learn any real skills, etc, turns out I did just fine and now those same people always have to call me for help when they run into the smallest issue with technology.I think a lot of people here are going to become roadkill if they refuse to learn how to use these new tools. I just built a web app in 3 weeks with only prompts to Claude Code, I didn't write a single line of code, and it works great. It's pretty basic, but probably would have taken me 3+ months instead of 3 weeks doing it the old fashioned way. If you tried it once a year ago and have written it off, a lot has changed since then and the tools continue to improve every month. I really think that eventually no one will be checking code just like hardly anyone checks the assembly output of a compiler anymore.You have to understand how the context window works, how to establish guardrails so you're not wasting time repeating the same things over and over again, force it to check its own work with lots of tests, etc. It's really a game changer when you can just say in one prompt \"write me an admin dashboard that displays users, sessions, and orders with a table and chart going back 30 days\" or \"wire up my site for google analytics, my tag code is XXXXXXX\" and it just works.reply",

      "Yes, because they're more likely to understand that the computer isn't this magical black box, and that just because we've made ELIZA marginally better, doesn't mean it's actually good.

For beginners and people who do cookie cutter work, this can be incredible because it writes the same or better code they could write, fast and for free. But for experts, the code it produces is consistently worse than what we can do. At best my pride demands I fix all its flaws before shipping. More commonly, it\u2019s a waste of time to ask it to help, and I need to code the solution from scratch myself anyway.I use it for throwaway prototypes and demos. And whenever I\u2019m thrust into a language I don\u2019t know that well, or to help me debug weird issues outside my area of expertise.

The most obviously wrong thing is with CSS - when I try to do some styling, it gets 90% of the way there, but there's almost always something that's not quite right.Then I tell the AI to fix a style, since that div is getting clipped or not correctly centered etc.It almost always keeps adding properties, and after 2-3 tries and an incredibly bloated style, I delete the thing and take a step back and think logically about how to properly lay this out with flexbox.reply",

Automatic decay should have died when it became possible to pass structs by value. Its continued existence continues to result in people writing objectively inferior function signatures (though part of this it the absurdity of C type declarations making the objectively correct type a pain to write or use, another one of the worst actual design mistakes).Fat pointers or argument-aware non-fixed size array parameters are a separate valuable feature, but it is at least understandable for them to not have been included at the time.reply",

The examples from the article are neat but fairly specific because cryptographic functions always work with pre-defined array sizes, unlike most algorithms.Incidentally, that was one of the main complaints about Pascal back in the day (see section 2.1 of [1]): it originally had only fixed-size arrays and strings, with no way for a function to accept a \"generic array\" or a \"generic string\" with size unknown at compile time.[1] https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/bwk-on-pas...reply",

      "I've watched a lot of live coding tools out of interest for the last few years, and as much as I'd like to adopt them in my music making it's not clear to me what they can add to my production repertoire compared to the existing tools (DAWs, hardware instruments, playing by hand, etc).The coding aspect is novel I'll admit, and something an audience may find interesting, but I've yet to hear any examples of live coded music (or even coded music) that I'd actually want to listen to. They almost always take the form of some bog-standard house music or techno, which I don't find that enjoyable.Additionally, the technique is fun for demonstrating how sound synthesis works (like in the OP article), but anything more complex or nuanced is never explored or attempted. Sequencing a nuanced instrumental part (or multiple) requires a lot of moment-to-moment detail, dynamics, and variation. Something that is tedious to sequence and simply doesn't play to this formats' strengths.So again, I want to integrate this skill into my music production tool set, but aside from the novelty of coding live, it doesn't appear well-suited to making interesting music in real time. And for offline sequencing there are better, more sophisticated tools, like DAWs or trackers.reply",
      "Every generation of musicians for the past 8 decades has had the same thoughts.  What live coding tools for synthesis offers you is an understanding of the nature of generational technology.Consider this: there are teenagers today, out there somewhere, learning to code music.  Remember when synthesisers were young and cool and there was an explosion of different engines and implementations?This is happening for the kids, again.Try to use this new technology to replicate the modern, and then the old sound, and then discover new sounds.  Like we synth nerds have been doing for decades.reply",
      "Music coding technology has been around a long time - think of tools like csound and pd and Max/MSP. They're great for coding synthesizers. Nobody uses them to do songs. Even Strudel has tools for basic GUI components because once you get past the novelty of 'this line of code is modulating the filter wowow' typing in numeric values for frequency or note duration is the least efficient way to interact with the machine.Pro developers who really care about the sound variously write in C/C++ or use cross compilers for pd or Max. High quality oscillators, filters, reverb etc are hard work, although you can certainly get very good results with basic ones given today's fast processors.Live coding is better for conditionals like 'every time [note] is played increment [counter], when [counter] > 15 reset [counter] to 0 and trigger [something else]'. But people who are focused on the result rather than the live coding performance tend to either make their own custom tooling (Autechre) or programmable Eurorack modules that integrate into a larger setup, eg https://www.perfectcircuit.com/signal/the-programmable-euror...It's not that you can't get great musical results via coding, of course you can. But coding as performance is a celebration of the repl, not of the music per se.reply",
      "I see it as a neat way for nerds to nerd out about nerd stuff in an experiential way. Like, this is not going to headline a big time rave or festival or anything, but in a community of people who like math or programming or science, sure, why not introduce this kind of performance as another little celebration of their hobby?Years ago I went to a sci-fi convention for the first time, because I had moved to a new town and didn't know anyone, and I like sci-fi. I realized when I was there that despite me growing up reading Hugo and Nebula award winners, despite watching pretty much every sci-fi show on TV, despite being a full-time computer nerd, the folks who go to sci-fi conventions are a whole nother subculture again. They have their own heroes, their own in-jokes, their own jargon... and even their own form of music! It's made by people in the community for the community and it misses the point to judge it by \"objective\" standards from the outside, because it's not about trying to make \"interesting music\" or write the best song of all time. The music made in that context is not being made as an end in itself, or even as the focus of the event, it's just a mechanism to enable a quirky subculture to hang out and bond in a way that's fun for them. I see this kind of live coded music as fulfilling a similar role in a different subculture. Maybe it's not for you, but that's fine.reply",
      "I find trackers to be in the same category you put live coding into, probably DAWs as well, but many people do some amazing things with all three. In the more academic computer music world there is a fair amount of diversity in live coding where it is generally combined with algorithmic/generative techniques to rapidly create complexity and nuance. SuperCollider seems to have the most interesting output here, for me at least; I have seen little that really grabs me but they do show the capabilities of the process and I find that quite interesting. Improvisation and jamming is just not my thing, so live coding falls a bit short for me.reply",
      "100% agree.I think this format of composition is going to encourage a highly repetitive structure to your music. Good programming languages constrain and prevent the construction of bad programs. Applying that to music is effectively going to give you quantization of every dimension of composition.I'm sure its possible to break out of that but you are fighting an uphill battle.reply",
      "Quite the opposite actually. certain live coding languages give you the tools to create extremely complex patterns in a very controlled manner, in ways you simply wouldn't be able to do via any other method. the most popular artist exploring these ideas is Kindohm, who is sort of an ambassador figure for the TidalCycles language. \nHaving used TidalCycles myself, the language lends itself particularly well to this kind of stuff as opposed to more traditional song/track structures. And yet it also constrains and prevents the construction of bad programs in a very strict manner via its type system and compiler.It's also notable for being probably the only Haskell library used almost exclusively by people with no prior knowledge of Haskell, which is an insane feat in itself.reply",
      "> Quite the opposite actually. certain live coding languages give you the tools to create extremely complex patternsI think I must not be expressing myself well. These tools seem to be optimized for parametric pattern manipulation. You essentially declare patterns, apply transformations to them, and then play them back in loops. The whole paradigm is going to encourage a very specific style of composition where repeating structures and their variations are the primary organizational principle.Again, I'm not trying to critique the styles of music that lend themselves well to these tools.> And yet it also constrains and prevents the construction of bad programs in a very strict manner via its type system and compiler.Looking at the examples in their documentation, all I see are examples like:    d1 $ sound \"[[bd [bd bd bd bd]] bd sn:5] [bd sn:3]\"\n\nSo it definitely isn't leveraging GHC's typechecker for your compositions. Is the TidalCycles runtime doing some kind of runtime typechecking on whatever it parses from these strings?> It's also notable for being probably the only Haskell library used almost exclusively by people with no prior knowledge of Haskell, which is an insane feat in itself.I think Pandoc or Shellcheck would win on this metric.reply",

I have a power-hungry GPU (3080) and CPU (9800X3D).All my audio equipment was on the same UPS (and therefore outlet) as my gaming PC.The result is that any time a particularly stressful game would be open, I'd get buzzing in the speakers. (Especially if the framerate was at 360) If you ask audiophiles online they will swear up and down that a cheater plug, balanced cables, or optical isolation will fix it - that will not fix it. It's not a ground problem. It's not coming from the connection from the PC to the DAC - it's a power issue.It seemed almost inconceivable to them that the problem was EMI from the computer making it into the equipment.I temporarily got a double-conversion UPS (converts AC to DC to AC again) and housed the audio equipment on that instead (separate from PC) Lo-and-behold the noise was completely gone.However, those UPS are extremely expensive, and far worse they're very loud because the fans run constantly.So, I went with a simpler alternative. Just get a power strip and plug all the audio equipment into that on a different outlet. That reduces it massively. You can also get some strips that are designed to reduce EMI, but I haven't felt the need as of yet.reply",
      "If you're a bit handy, you can assemble a line filter using a part like this https://enerdoor.com/products/fin27/ for a heck of a lot cheaper than you can buy a filtered power strip.You may also be able to solve the problem with a simple common mode choke, either the clip-on type, or a toroid that you wrap the cable through a couple-few times. https://palomar-engineers.com/rfi-kits/acdc-power-line-choke...reply",
      "A filter like that will have very little attenuation in the audio spectrum.I agree however that indiscriminately throwing ferrites at problems can be a good solution!reply",
      "Even if there's very little audio-frequency attenuation, it's possible for higher frequencies to produce audio-frequency intermodulation distortion, and filtering could reduce this. This is one reason \"high definition\" (ultrasound sampling rate) audio is a bad idea as a listening format.reply",
      "This reminds me of my favorite \"Downfall\" meme video.[Youtube] \"Hitler fails radiated emissions\" - Orin Laney: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeo8ZZTfwZQreply",
      "Ferrites - almost never doing any harm, sometimes doing good. :-)reply",
      "Maybe you\u2019re right. My experience is with radios, where it\u2019s possible that high frequency noise is conducted into the RF section rather than into the audio amplifier. I know that in one case, both my transmitted signal and received audio output were absolute garbage (edit: because it was picking up noise from the vehicle ignition) until I added a choke to the power input wiring.reply",
      "Well the OP\u2019s electrical noise almost certainly is coming through the USB connection as their DAC has no external power supply. Extremely common.Your problem of an AC power supply not sufficiently filtering out high-frequency noise from mains is exceptionally rare to the point that yes, I also don\u2019t believe that was the correct diagnosis of your issue.reply",
      "Pure sine wave UPSs are not that expensive anymore man. I think the biggest \"desktop\" pure sine wave cyberpower sells (1500VA/1000W, CP1500PFCLCD) is <$300 now. I have a couple of them, they are great.reply",
      "It's not about pure sine wave - it's double conversion. Only double-conversion would actually isolate the equipment from EMI on the line. Without that pure sine wave won't do squat for EMI.And one of those, even the cheapest ones, run for about ~$900. And they are LOUD.reply"

    "first_paragraph": "\nDec 3, 2025\n      I am working on an isometric game inspired from Gnomoria, RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress, etc. It uses my own simple engine (with rust and wgpu-rs).

It\u2019s only my game.And it\u2019s really annoying, as you might imagine.Why can I play Overwatch and Fortnite fine, while my isometric game makes my headset buzz?\nI had a fairly decent CPU, a 3090RTX card, 32GB RAM and USB audio through a MODI 2 DAC.\nNothing out of this world, but nothing too bad. One important detail here is that the power to the MODI device comes from an USB port in my computer. This was the first clue, I tried other ports with no change in results (headphones still buzzed).Initially, I started to think it\u2019s some sort of power-use related issue, because maybe my PSU was getting old, or had daemons in it.

      "Big thanks to MinIO, RustFS, and Garage for their contributions. That said, MinIO closing the door on open source so abruptly definitely spooked the community. But honestly, fair play to them\u2014open source projects eventually need a path to monetization.I\u2019ve evaluated both RustFS and Garage, and here\u2019s the breakdown:Release Cadence: Garage feels a bit slower, while RustFS is shipping updates almost weekly.Licensing: Garage is on AGPLv3, but RustFS uses the Apache license (which is huge for enterprise adoption).Stability: Garage currently has the edge in distributed environments.With MinIO effectively bowing out of the OSS race, my money is on RustFS to take the lead.reply",
      "> open source projects eventually need a path to monetizationI guess I'm curious if I'm understanding what you mean here, because it seems like there's a huge number of counterexamples. GNU coreutils. The linux kernel. FreeBSD. NFS and iSCSI drivers for either of those kernels. Cgroups in the Linux kernel.If anything, it seems strange to expect to be able to monetize free-as-in-freedom software. GNU freedom number 0 is \"The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose\". I don't see anything in there about \"except for business purposes\", or anything in there about \"except for businesses I think can afford to pay me\". It seems like a lot of these \"open core\" cloud companies just have a fundamental misunderstanding about what free software is.Which isn't to say I have anything against people choosing to monetize their software. I couldn't afford to give all my work away for free, which is why I don't do that. However, I don't feel a lot of sympathy to people who surely use tons of actual libre software without paying for it, when someone uses their libre software without paying.reply",
      "I think, if anything, in this age of AI coding we should see a resurgence in true open-source projects where people are writing code how they feel like writing it and tossing it out into the world. The quality will be a mixed bag! and that's okay. No warranty expressed or implied. As the quality rises and the cost of AI coding drops - and it will, this phase of $500/mo for Cursor is not going to last - I think we'll see plenty more open source projects that embody the spirit you're talking about.The trick here is that people may not want to be coding MinIO. It's like... just not that fun of a thing to work on, compared to something more visible, more elevator-pitchy, more sexy. You spend all your spare time donating your labour to a project that... serves files? I the lowly devops bow before you and thank you for your beautiful contribution, but I the person meeting you at a party wonder why you do this in particular with your spare time instead of, well, so many other things.I've never understood it, but then, that's why I'm not a famous open-source dev, right?reply",
      "you mean... like Linux? or gcc?reply",
      "There is https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfsI haver not used it but will be likely a good minio alternative for people who want to run a server and don't use minio just as s3 client.reply",
      "Is it stable now? Last time I checked, the amount of correctness bugs being fixed in the Git history wasn't very confidence-inspiring.reply",
      "Since storage is a critical component, I closely watched it and engaged with the project for about 2 years circa as i contemplated adding it to our project, but the project is still immature from a reliability perspective in my opinion.No test suite, plenty of regressions, and data loss bugs on core code paths that should have been battled tested after so many years. There are many moving parts, which is both its strength and its weakness as anything can break - and does break. Even Erasure Coding/Decoding has had problems, but a guy from Proton has contributed a lot of fixes in this area lately.One of the big positive in my opinion, is the maintainer. He is an extremely friendly and responsive gentleman. Seaweedfs is also the most lightweight storage system you can find, and it is extremely easy to set up, and can run on servers with very little hardware resources.Many people are happy with it, but you'd better be ready to understand their file format to fix corruption issues by hand. As far as i am concerned, i realized that after watching all these bugs, the idea of using seaweedfs was causing me more anxiety than peace of mind. Since we didn't need to store billions of files yet, not even millions, we went with creating a file storage API in ASP.NET Core in 1 or 2 hours, hosted on a VPS, that we can replicate using rsync without problem. Since i made this decision, i have peace of mind and no longer think about my storage system. Simplicity is often better, and OSes have long been optimized to cache and serve files natively.If you are not interested in contributing fixes and digging into the file format when a problem occurs, and if your data is important to you, unless you operate at the billions of files scalability tier Seaweedfs shines at, i'd suggest rolling your own boring storage system.reply",
      "We're in the process of moving to it, and it does seem to have a lot of small bugfixes flying around, but the maintainer is EXTREMELY responsive. I think we'll just end up doing a bit of testing before upgrading to newer versions.For our use case (3 nodes, 61TB of NVMe) it seems like the best option out of what I looked at (GarageFS, JuiceFS, Ceph). If we had 5+ nodes I'd probably have gone with Ceph though.reply",
      "I'm looking at deploying SeaWeedFS but the problem is cloud block storage costs. I need 3-4TB and Vultr costs $62.50/mo for 2.5TB. DigitalOcean $300/mo for 3TB. AWS using legacy magnetic EBS storage $150/mo... GCP persistent disk standard $120/mo.Any alternatives besides racking own servers?*EDIT* Did a little ChatGPT and it recommended tiny t4g.micro then use EBS of type cold HDD (sc1). Not gonna be fast, but for offsite backup will probably do the trick.reply",
