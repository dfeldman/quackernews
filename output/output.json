      "Dear news publications - if you aren't willing to accept an independent record of what you published, I can't accept your news. It's a critical piece of the framework that keeps you honest. I don't care if you allow AI scraping either way, but you have to facilitate archival of your content - independently, not under your own control.reply",
      "How is the publisher supposed to fund their operations let along make a profit. How about a 1 year lock on the archive pages. There are many ways of keeping that record but not taking views undermining the business modelreply",
      "It's a great question, but they didn't seem to have a problem with this before AI, so I have to assume that the presence of a free available copy wasn't really impacting their revenue.reply",
      "Maybe it would be better if these news operations had to find better ways to sustain themselves than the current paradigms. Also, the internet archive is not the only archive, and there will be more. This ins't something they can really stop.reply",
      "The records already exist. Check your local library. The entire point of this is the scrapers undermine the business model.If anything, we should simply me asking archive.org to limit their access to humans.reply",
      "Libraries dont keep all periodicals and dont keep them forever. And microfilm is really lossy, unreliable, and difficult to search.reply",
      "To hell with contempt of business model. Business models aren't sacred. Besides which, with business models owners capture the newsroom anyway.reply",
      "As a news publisher (RedBankGreen.com) I\u2019ll tell you that pretty much nobody is in it for the money anymore, at least at the local level.It\u2019s passion and love of the community, despite the many struggles and drawbacks.AI bots scrape our content and that drastically reduces the number of people who make it to our site.That impacts our ability to bring on subscribers and especially advertisers - Google and Meta own local advertising and AI kills the relatively tiny audience we have.I dread the day that it happens in realtime - hear sirens? Ask AI who already scraped us.reply",
      "Every business (even news) needs a business model.reply",
      "Yes, but not every business works, and not every business model works, and not every business model works with every business, etc etc.It's on the business to find a model that works within the environment of the free market and within the social framework.If a business model only works by limiting competition, it's a bad model.If it only works by limiting the rights of consumers, it's a bad model.If it only works by blocking a legal activity (website crawling and scraping of publicly-facing data, for instance), it's a bad model.And if their business can't operate otherwise, it's a bad business. No business has an intrinsic right to exist.reply"

      "I\u2019m paying over 40 dollars a month for YouTube but it doesn\u2019t allow me to choose almost anything of what I see, despite trying hard to fine-tune my recommendations.I can\u2019t permanently turn off shorts - and this I find personally insulting. It really feels like encountering a drug dealer outside my house every time I come home, always expecting me to cave and try some of that good smack.But apart from ignoring me when I say I\u2019m not interested in whole genres of \u2018fun\u2019 videos, it also resets the streaming quality to the lowest setting every single day and then hides the quality setting deep inside a menu with several fiddly clicks.And this isn\u2019t for my benefit of course: I can easily stream 4K video to my screens. It\u2019s to shave a few cents off each stream and max the gouging.reply",
      "YT is desperate for me to engage with rage bait news, and I\u2019m not biting.It\u2019s so god damn annoying, regardless of how often I choose to ignore channels or don\u2019t suggest feedback.All they care about is vote time\u2026give me content I want to view!Also, in the evenings, my timeline gets weirdly paranoid phobia centric, like deep insecurities people live with that are triggering and keep you up late. It\u2019s so obvious YT is doing this to try and bait me into watching these deeply emotional and personal content, and again, ignoring it and providing feedback seems to do nothing to my feed. I hate it.reply",
      "I kept having issues like this, with a different kinds of videos, until I scrubbed my history of any of the kinds of videos I did not want.If I click on something I thought I would want to watch and it is the kind of video I do not want recommended to me I immediately delete it from my watch history, block the channel, and some times block that profile from viewing my youtube channel.~2 years ago I never had to delete anything from my watch history and my feed/recommendations were ok, now I have to if I do not want my feed/recommendations to occasionally be flooded with something I do not want.reply",
      "I only use YouTube with my watch history set to off. So there is no feed, and I only see updates from channels I actually subscribed to. If I want to see some random crap I go search for it but it\u2019s a clean slate next time I open the app. I have found this method of using YouTube to be extremely useful.reply",
      "Turn off history. Completely disables the food. The only content you see is what you search for.reply",
      "To me history is useful to continue watching or find videos I\u2019ve already seen. Turning it off will remove a feature I actually need. They force us to see their horrible \u201cfor you\u201d content in exchange - so shameful.reply",
      "Do not give them the satisfaction. Dont like videos and never comment on anything. The videos are the bait. The comments sections are the trap.  Use youtube as a multi-channel TV.  Keep it a one-way stream of data. Give them nothing beyond the unavoidable knowledge of what you watch.reply",
      "I use ReVanced on Android and it allows me to hide shorts. A 'pirated' version of the app offers a much better experience than even the paid option of it.reply",
      "> We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy. Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem. If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate\u2019s service is more valuable.- Gabe Newellreply",

      "Kickstarter is full of projects like this where every possible shortcut is taken to get to market. I\u2019ve had some good success with a few Kickstarter projects but I\u2019ve been very selective about which projects I support. More often than not I can identify when a team is in over their heads or think they\u2019re just going to figure out the details later, after the money arrives.For a period of time it was popular for the industrial designers I knew to try to launch their own Kickstarters. Their belief was that engineering was a commodity that they could hire out to the lowest bidder after they got the money. The product design and marketing (their specialty) was the real value. All of their projects either failed or cost them more money than they brought in because engineering was harder than they thought.I think we\u2019re in for another round of this now that LLMs give the impression that the software and firmware parts are basically free. All of those project ideas people had previously that were shelved because software is hard are getting another look from people who think they\u2019re just going to prompt Claude until the product looks like it works.reply",

      "Is there more context to this? I'm assuming Ben is experimenting and demonstrating the danger of vibe circuit designing? Mostly because I know he has a ton of experience and I'd expect him to not make this mistake (also seems like he told the AI why it was wrong)reply",
      "People make these mistakes too. Several times in my high school shop class kids shorted out 9V batteries trying to build circuits because they didn't understand how electronics work. At no point did our teacher stop them from doing so - on at least one occasion I unplugged one from a breadboard before it got too toasty to handle (and I was/am an electronics nublet). Similarly there was also a lot of hand-wringing about the Gemini pizza glue in a world where people do wacky stuff like cook fish in a dishwasher or defrost chicken overnight on the counter or put cooked steak on the same plate it was on when raw just a few minutes prior.LLMs are just surfacing the fact that assessing and managing risk is an acquired, difficult-to-learn skill. Most people don't know what they don't know and fail to think about what might happen if they do something (correctly or otherwise) before they do it, let alone what they'd do if it goes wrong.reply",
      "Well said, but I'd add that LLMs are also surfacing the fact that there's a swathe of people out there who will treat the machines as more trustworthy than humans by default, and don't believe they need to do any assessment or risk management in the first place.reply",
      "What\u2019s wrong with dishwasher salmon?reply",
      "What's your point?The AI is being sold as an expert, not a student. These are categorically different things.The mistake in the post is one that can be avoided by taking a single class at a community college. No PhD required, not even a B.S., not even an electricians certificate.So I don't get your point. You're comparing a person in a learning environment to the equivalent of a person claiming to have a PhD in electrical engineering. A student letting the magic smoke escape from a basic circuit is a learnable experience (a memorable one that has high impact), especially when done in a learning environment where an expert can ensure more dangerous mistakes are less likely or non existent. But the same action from a PhD educated engineer would make you reasonably question their qualifications. Yes, humans make mistakes but if you follow the AI's instructions and light things on fire you get sued. If you follow the engineer's instructions and set things on fire then that engineer gets fired likely loses their license.So what is your point?reply",

Well I think a bunch of companies are asking this same question to their employees and realising that the productivity gains they are betting on were overhyped.LLM's can be a very useful tool and will probably lead to measurable productivity increases in the future, at their current state they are not capable of replacing most knowledge workers.

      "Is this the same compiler that famously spurred Richard Stallman to create GCC [1] when its author \"responded derisively, stating that the university was free but the compiler was not\"?It seems to be free now anyway, since 2005 according to the git history, under a 3-clause BSD license.[1] https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.htmlreply",
      "The relevant bit:\" Shortly before beginning the GNU Project, I heard about the Free University Compiler Kit, also known as VUCK. (The Dutch word for \u201cfree\u201d is written with a v.) This was a compiler designed to handle multiple languages, including C and Pascal, and to support multiple target machines. I wrote to its author asking if GNU could use it.He responded derisively, stating that the university was free but the compiler was not. I therefore decided that my first program for the GNU Project would be a multilanguage, multiplatform compiler.\"And not only was the university 'free' and the compiler not, neither was 'Minix', which was put out there through Prentice Hall in a series of books that you had to pay a fairly ridiculous amount of money for if you were a student there.So the VU had the two main components of the free software world in their hand and botched them both because of simple greed.I love it how RMS has both these quotes in the same text:\"Please don't fall into the practice of calling the whole system \u201cLinux,\u201d since that means attributing our work to someone else. Please give us equal mention.\"\"This makes it difficult to write free drivers so that Linux and XFree86 can support new hardware.\"And there are only a few lines between those quotes.reply",
      "I was one of those students saving up the large sum for the book, when Linux was announced.  There were other tensions at the time - the biggest was that Minix on 8086 was 16 bit real mode only.  Someone had developed patches to run in 32 bit protected mode, but they were invasive and large, and the Minix maintainers would not integrate them as the increased complexity would not help the mission of Minix being easy to learn and tinker with.  The filesystem code was also single threaded, essentially doing one request at a time.  IIRC there were patches to address that too, also not integrated for the same reason.  (Note that the books included print outs of the source so keeping it short did matter.)This explains the final 2 sentences of the original Linux announcement:> PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.The book publisher is blamed for preventing Minix from being freely distributed:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix#Licensingreply",
      "Re your last paragraphs: I think RMS really meant just the Linux kernel when he wrote that(the topic is drivers, after all), not GNU/Linux, the OS or GNU/Linux, \"the system\". So it can be argued that he isn't really contradicting himselfreply",

They weren\u2019t very smart, the servos were too slow and too weak.So I looked at Huggingface Lerobot project. I ordered the servos for the SO-ARM101. Trained it to pick up a ball and throw it. That sucker launched it across the room. I\u2019ve now replaced the gripper with a TPU soft grip. And I\u2019m training it to use a pen and paper.These newer Dynamixel and Feetech servos are far more capable than the old RC servos I was using for years.

      "I was very interested in athletic robots, so I left my job in software to build a quadruped and make it backflip [1]. I made the hardware at home (the design was open-source [2]) and wrote the framework to generate jumps, flips, etc. I started with basically zero robotics knowledge, so it was a lot of work, but it was incredibly fulfilling and super fun. I personally learn best by building things.I'd say start playing with 3D printing and motors to make mechanisms that move (pendulums, simple walkers, ...). +1 to tinkering with the 3D printer itself (that someone mentioned) as you can learn a lot about how the machine works and figure out ways to improve it.You've mentioned the physical aspect, but simulation could also be a good starting point. You can now very easily train RL agents in sim to say, walk, and transfer to real hardware afterwards.Finally, if you like flying stuff, there's drones you can buy that are controlled programmatically (e.g. Crazyflie). I haven't played a lot with these, but I've seen them used to teach control and they seem like a nice, inexpensive platform to experiment with.[1]: https://github.com/rkourdis/trajopt?tab=readme-ov-file#backf...[2]: https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.ioreply"
