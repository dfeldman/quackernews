      "The main thing I learned was that Cronenberg was offered the directing job for ROTJ. Cronenberg was at one time in line to direct Totall Recall, and he wrote a draft of the screenplay. Totall Recall certainly includes a bit of the trademark body horror.Cronenberg made The Fly in Hollywood, and I think it's it's great, but he wasn't able to get much more than that on the go, even though he came close to landing several high profile gigs.In some alternate history timeline Cronenberg's name would have been attached to several big time Hollywood properties, and the world would be mostly the same just a little bit grosser. Of course, I'm happy with Cronenberg's mostly Canadian produced oeuvre the way it is, I just like to wonder.I also used to wonder what the world would look like if Lynch has directed ROTJ, but I came to realize it was a ridiculous premise, Lynch needed far more creative elbow room than what the 3rd instalment of an established franchise could possibly afford, and there was no chance Lynch would ever agree to such a thing. So we got Dune instead and I'm happy with that too.\n \nreply",

      "> Through some digging, I found that when a desktop enters S3 sleep, the system cuts power to PCIe GPUsI am not sure how correct this assumption is. S3 is supposed to cut power to everything but RAM, but for example Gigabyte Aorus motherboards are notorious for an NVMe SSD sleep bug that randomly prevents the system from properly sleeping or waking.This is fixed by adding the following udev rule:  # Generic PCIe fix for sleep bugs by preventing wakeup from any PCIe port\n  ACTION==\"offline\", SUBSYSTEM==\"pci\", DRIVER==\"pcieport\",     ATTR{power/wakeup}=\"disabled\"\n   \nor more targeted:  # Gigabyte sleep fix by preventing wakeup from problematic PCIe port, depends on motherboard model\n  ACTION==\"offline\",  SUBSYSTEM==\"pci\", ATTR{vendor}==\"0x8086\", ATTR{device}==\"0x43bc\", ATTR{power/wakeup}=\"disabled\"\n   \nYou can find any glitched PCIe wakeup device with:  1. cat /proc/acpi/wakeup (you'll have to trial and error your way through the wakeup devices if it isn't immediately clear)\n  2. cat /sys/class/pci_bus/*/*/yourWakeupDevicePci/uevent | grep PCI_ID\n  3. prepend \"0x\"\n\nYou also have the option of:  udevadm info --attribute-walk /dev/whatever\n  \nbut for that you need to know some basic identifier of your glitchy device.Or if you want to shellscript it (less reliable than letting udev do it for you and needs to be done via systemd service file or another automation):  # Gigabyte sleep fix, port depends on mobo model\n  /bin/bash -c 'if grep 'RP05' /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep -q 'enabled'; then echo 'RP05' > /proc/acpi/wakeup; fi'\";\n\n\nYes I really hate this (and other) Linux sleep issues.\n \nreply",

      "Did you try the general fix? And reload udev rules?You also have to make sure it applies after the default rules.You can check if the rule applies once you have everything set up by doing an `udevadm` attribute walk of your SSD device (not partition), and then following it up all the way up the device tree until you see your specific device port (target fix) or PCIe driver subsystem (general fix). Then check if \"power/wakeup\" is set to \"disabled\". If it is set to disabled, something else is keeping your device awake on sleep.For that you can check /proc/acpi/wakeup, and there's also a specific systemd invocation (that I forgot) you can do that shows if your device slept, how long it slept, how much battery was drained, and if your device woke-up, slept or failed to resume, it'll give you a reason.. to the best of its ability.\n \nreply",
      "Hmm, on my motherboard I had to disable spontaneous wake by adding to /etc/udev/rules.d/:  ACTION==\"add\", KERNELS==\"0000:00:01.1\", ATTR{power/wakeup}=\"disabled\"\n\nAnd my Logitech Bolt receiver wakes multiple of my Linux computers instantly, I don't know why it doesn't do that on Windows and haven't tried doing a USB capture (and don't know what equipment I'd need to try it out, logic analyzer? Glasgow?). In the meantime I've added a rule to block that:  ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", DRIVERS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"046d\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"c548\", ATTR{power/wakeup}=\"disabled\"\n \nreply",
      "Good tip!KERNELS==\"0000:00:01.1\" sounds like an interesting way to do it, since you can target separate functions of the PCI device (in this case: domain 0, bus 0, slot 1, function 1).\n \nreply",

Manufacturers also know most people aren\u2019t going to use a big part of the functions they\u2019re supposed to provide to OSes, and no one is really checking them, so it\u2019s very common for devices to have only partial support for things they supposedly do.\n \nreply",

Lenovo manages to do sleep/wake fine in Linux almost as well as Apple in my experience and I sleep/wake my Lenovo laptop regularly -- this is across two different models I have used so far (X1 and X390).

I traced this behavior to an amdgpu driver power/memory management bug, which took over a year to brainstorm and implement solutions for.TL;DR: The bug is fixed in agd5f/linux, and the change should be out in stable kernel 6.14.I started debugging this issue in 2023-09.

      "Hard to disagree. I can usually tell what type of type of experience devs have by the snarky, dismissive responses I've gotten on various internet forums over the last two decades. e.g. \"Oh but you would never have this problem if you performed proper code review\" - Random_Rockstar_Dev_254However not all legacy projects are bad to work on. If they're decently developed, then often you'll find that most of the pain is in setting up your local codebase. e.g. sorting out make files, or header file clashes etc. And if you're lucky, some poor bastard has already done the hard work for you.As an aside, I know tons of experienced \"Senior\" developers who just suck at their jobs. The problem is they have tons of experience in delivering terrible products based on terrible code and architectural decisions. They just never had anyone to show them any better. And now that they're \"Senior\", noone can tell them anything. Many devs who work in corporates understand this pain. Shoutouts to my peers who have to \"fix\" 3000 line stored procs with a 100 line \"change control comment saying stuff like \"2009-04-03   JS   Added TAX_REF_ID\". I live your pain.EDIT: Also, if you happen to work at company that thrives on terrible legacy products, try to drill it into their heads that BAU Support is not part of the solution.

      "To add (some overlap):  - Share credit and be generous with sharing\n    - It is better to error in the direction of over sharing credit than under sharing (taking credit for yourself)\n  - Slow down, say \"I don't know\" (good to follow up with \"but I'll find out\")\n    - Saying \"I don't know\" is often a better answer than guessing\n    - Guesses are fine, but should be prefaced and be clear that you speculate BUT will follow up and verify\n    - Not knowing is the first step to knowing. You've turned an unknown unknown into a known unknown. That's a big step! And often one of the hardest! \n  - Encourage juniors to speak up and not be afraid of raising issues, even if those senior to them disagree.\n    - Either the junior provides valuable feedback that was missed (everyone is fallible) or it is a learning experience for the junior and //we invest in juniors//.\n    - Seniority does not make the dev, the logic/ideas/thinking does.\n  - Mentor more. I think we often want to send juniors to their corner so we can concentrate on our work, but you have to train those who will later on become your peers.\n    - There are no graybeards without noobs\n  - Encourage more collaboration\n    - Especially when there are complementary skill sets\n  - Drive culture that recognizes that ones ideas are not a reflection of their value. What I mean is that it is okay to be wrong. The idea is distinct from you, and you are more than just one idea\n    - We're all wrong, it is just a matter of \"how\" wrong\n    - Having a \"bad idea\" or \"wrong solution\" doesn't mean /you're/ wrong/bad.\n  - Recognize that we're all on the same team. Criticism is constructive\n    - A critique is not a dismissal, it is because we are all on the same team trying to make the best thing. An outside view is often helpful to finding issues. We work as a team, so criticism is debugging as a team, just as you criticize your own work when initially formulating ideas (you reject some ideas, find limits, and formulate plans. Criticism is the collaborative version).\n    - This means also be careful how you hand out criticism. Ensure it is always constructive. It always contains an explanation and a path forward (as much as possible). \n    - Competition can be beneficial, but it can easily create tribalism. Fight the natural tribalism because we're all on the same team (helps to have team mixing)\n  - Make time for learning\n    - The job always involves learning, no matter how senior you are. If there is only time for \"doing\" and no \"learning\" then you will only gain debt and you especially are teaching juniors the wrong lesson. \n\nI would state that the first point can be a bit tricky. I've worked in some environments where one or two people follow the point and no one else does, so this ends up with those people being seen as \"non-productive.\" This is more representative of poor management though and I'd push back against the toxicity to the extent possible.For managers: the last point is really important. Your coders shouldn't always be sitting in front of their IDE or terminal typing code. They should be spending a fair amount of time reading docs, writing docs, and googling. Writing docs is actually important as it helps communicate ideas, which also serve as reports to YOU. This communication also helps de-abstract the ideas and often leads to finding issues. It is an important step to debugging. (It is often a good idea to have juniors build or append docs when they are onboarding. Dual serves as the intro to the codebase)\n \nreply",

Maybe my way of thinking about the situation is different than yours, and I could also be completely wrong. I am just much more pessimistic when it comes to how much value is in user data (especially as AI develops more), to think that larger players won't do anything they can to collect user data by finding loopholes in the law, or allowing themselves to be taken to court because the laws aren't defined well enough.\n \nreply",

The first one is the idea that privacy is dead, implying it's not worth putting any effort to protect personal data anymore. This is the abdication mindset. This attitude is the one that scares me the most because without giving it a fight then of course the battle is lost in advance. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, privacy is dead if you let it die.All human rights have seen advancements and improvements in history through long battles and hard-earned victories. There needs to be people willing to fight in order to win the fight. Losing a human right is easy. Protecting a human right always requires lots of effort.The second mindset I want to bring up might seem like the diametric opposite, but in fact often leads to the same outcome overtime, and feeds the aforementioned.

      "Love me some Peter Gutmann. This is classic Gutmann.A lot of this presentation is mooted by understanding PQC as an scientific question rather than an engineering one. What are the precise natures of quantum-superior attacks on cryptosystems and what are key establishments and signatures that resist those attacks? Whatever else you think of quantum cryptanalysis those are undeniably important theoretical questions.A few more slides are mooted by the likelihood that any mainstream deployed PQC system is going to be hybridized with a classical cryptosystem.As an articulation of a threat model for modern computing, it simultaneously makes some sense and proves too much: if you think OWASP-type vulnerabilities are where everyone's head should be at (and I sort of agree), then all of cryptography is a sideshow. I'm a connoisseur of cryptographic vulnerabilities that break real systems the way SQL injection does (a bitflipping attack on an encrypted cookie, a broken load-bearing signature scheme) but even I have to admit there's 1 of those for every 10,000 conventional non-cryptographic attack.But of course, it also depends on who your adversary is. Ironically, if you're worried about state-level SIGINT, the barrier for OWASP-style attacks may be higher than that of large-scale codebreaking; passive interception and store-now-decrypt-later is the SIGINT love language.My biggest thing with all of this is a core belief about organizations like NSA: that they exist primarily to secure budget for NSA. Given that, the one thing you absolutely don't want to do is have a system that is breakable only at almost-implausible cost.(Also, his RSA-1024 analysis is off; it's missing batch attacks).\n \nreply",

      "Using the largest number factored as a benchmark for progress in quantum computing is like evaluating floor(f(0)) = 0 and floor(f(1)) = 0 and concluding f(x) = 0. You can't distinguish f(x) = 0 from f(x) = x/2 from f(x) = e^x/3 when your test is too coarse.If you want to see the progress in quantum computing today, pay attention to component reliability. For example, in 2014, the best rep code run on a quantum computer had a 1% error rate per round [1]. In 2024, it was 0.00000001% and it had become possible to run full quantum codes with a 0.2% error rate per round [2]. If it takes another decade for that 0.2% to go down by a factor of a thousand, then you've got lots of time. Maybe you'll be dead before progress exceeds the coarseness of factoring. If it takes a year instead of decade (because the cost of error correction is frontloaded) then, well, pay appropriate attention to that.[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7403[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13687\n \nreply",

      "With modern package managers you can just generate your SBOM out of your lock file and call it a day. That misses dependencies that cross language boundaries, but it gets you 98% there for 10% of the effort. But what if you are writing C++, where it's the norm for libraries to vendor their dependencies, with no way to automatically detect them?Sure, that is an opportunity for middleman to sell SBOM databases. But I could equally well see large c++ projects selling a subscription that offers an SBOM for each release, along with a couple bullet points to pad the offer (phone support, priority for feature requests and bug reports, early testing for new releases, etc).Similar to how every SaaS has an Enterprise plan that is ridiculously expensive because big companies will pay anything to get SSO and an audit trail. And the provider adds a couple more enterprise features so nobody has to justify why they pay 5x the regular price just to get those two features. Same, idea, but with companies paying $100/month to get an SBOM and nice-to-haves for software they could get for free\n \nreply",
