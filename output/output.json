Combining calendar, weather, and smart home data, it\u2019s become an important part of our daily lives.When Caitlin and I got married a decade ago, we set an intention to have a healthy relationship with technology in our home. We kept our bedroom free of any screens, charging our devices elsewhere overnight. But we missed our calendar and weather apps.So I set out to build a solution to our problem. First, I constructed a Magic Mirror using an off-the-shelf medicine cabinet and LCD display with its frame removed. It showed the calendar and weather data we needed:But it was hard to read the text, especially during the day as we get significant natural light in Colorado.

      "This is exactly why API-level access matters more than consumer subscriptions for production workloads. Consumer plans are subsidized with the assumption of interactive, low-volume usage. The moment you programmatically route through them, you break the economic model they're built on.The real issue is the lack of transparency. If Google's ToS says 'no programmatic access via third-party tools,' state it clearly and enforce it with warnings first. An instant ban with no recourse is hostile to paying customers who may genuinely not know where the line is.For anyone building production systems, the lesson is clear: use the actual API tiers, budget for it, and treat consumer subscriptions as evaluation tools only.reply",

I can then just use OS IO tooling to wire OpenClaw with their cli. Is that allowed?How does sending requests directly to the endpoints that their CLI is communicating with suddenly make their subsidized plans expensive? Is it because now I can actually use my 100% quota? If that's so, does it mean their products are such that their profitability stands on people not using them?What is even going on?reply",
      "The direct answer is their clients play extra nice with their backend.Specifically all optimize caching.The indirect answer is for everyone using third party tools to play about there are 10x using it to spam or malicious use cases hammering their backend far cheaper than if it was by API.These people are the false positives in this situation, but whether Google or Claude care is unlikely. They're happy to ban you and expect you to sign up for the API.This has always been a worry when you use a service like Google.reply",

Common system prompts and all, and more and more users hitting cache really makes the cost of inference go down dramatically.What bothers me about a lot of the discussion about providers disallowing other harnesses with the subscription plans around here is the complete lack of awareness of how economies of scale from common caching practices across more users can enable the higher, cheaper quotas subscriptions give you.reply"

That news organization is managing to be fairly independent, prevalent and significant when all others are caving to walled gardens and billionaires. social media in general should be viewed similar to journalistic organizations in terms of governance structure.it is nice to be able to take your data elsewhere, it is nicer not having the need to begin with.

The vessel would be struck with wooden sticks, the bows stained with red ochre and crew members would adorn their arms with shells.Malinowski recorded a long list of ceremonies and rituals the islanders would perform before venturing out onto the open sea.

WARN filings have the rare property of being legally mandated with specific timing (60-day advance notice), which makes the signal horizon predictable in a way that most alternative data is not.The big caveat: compliance is uneven. Companies under 100 employees are exempt, and there is a documented pattern of employers paying WARN Act penalties retroactively rather than filing -- especially in fast-moving situations where 60 days advance notice is operationally inconvenient. So the signal has systematic gaps at exactly the moments of highest market interest.Have you looked at coverage rates vs. announced layoffs (e.g., correlation with Challenger Gray reports or JOLTS)?

The article reflected on Klein\u2019s view of elementary mathematics, which I found to be surprisingly modern, and made some comments on how his view might change in the light of today\u2019s mathematics. With further reflection I realized that a discussion of elementary mathematics today should include not only some topics that are elementary from the twenty-first-century viewpoint, but also a more precise explanation of the term \u201celementary\u201d than was possible in Klein\u2019s day.So, the first goal of the book is to give a bird\u2019s eye view of elementary mathematics and its treasures. This view will sometimes be \u201cfrom an advanced standpoint,\u201d but nevertheless as elementary as possible. Readers with a good high school training in mathematics should be able to understand most of the book, though no doubt everyone will experience some difficulties, due to the wide range of topics...The second goal of the book is to explain what \u201celementary\u201d means, or at least to explain why certain pieces of mathematics seem to be \u201cmore elementary\u201d than others. It might be thought that the concept of \u201celementary\u201d changes continually as mathematics advances. Indeed, some topics now considered part of elementary mathematics are there because some great advance made them elementary...Note: \"Elementary\" here does not mean Easy.reply",

      "The caveat is that you might end up shaving a yak.More often than not I end up three or four tasks deep while trying to fix a tiny issue.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_UZFI-8D5uAreply",
      "There is simply no general recipe for this. Sometimes I put my little tools and libraries in order and then I'm very productive with them and looking back it seems to have been the key enabler to the actual thing getting done. Other times I go dirty mode and just hardcode constants, copy code files under time pressure and looking back it is clear that getting to the same result with the clean approach would have taken months and the benefit for later tasks would be unclear.I know some are tired of AI discourse, but I found AI can help to sharpen the tools but at the same time I find that my scope grows such that dealing with the tools takes just as much time but the tools have more features \"just in case\" and support platforms or use cases that I won't often need, but it feels easy enough to just do, but then as I said it still takes long in total.It's all mostly an emotional procrastination issue underneath it. Though that can go both ways. Sometimes you procrastinate on thinking about the overall architecture in favor of just making messy edits because thinking about the overall problem is more taxing than just doing a small iteration, sometimes you procrastinate on getting the thing done in favor of working on more tightly scoped neat little tools that are easier to keep in mind than the vague and sprawling overall goals.reply",
      "What looks like \"wasting time on procrastination\" may be actually \"spending time on thinking\". Thinking takes time.Making messy edits is a bet on previous code quality. If you have paid off enough technical debt, you can take another \"technical loan\" and expect the rest of the owl to still function despite the mess being introduced. If things are already messy, there's always a risk to make the fess incomprehensible and failing in mysterious seemingly unrelated ways, with the only way to fix it being to git reset --hard to the prior point, and do a more right thing. But the time would have been wasted already.My approach is usually to timebox it, and cut the losses if an acceptable solution is not yet in sight when the time runs out.reply",
      "I don't like that 'yak shaving' has degenerated into a synonym for boondoggle.Some explanations of yak shaving split it into a complex form of procrastination and also necessary annoyances - friction - obstacles.Sharpen your Tools often falls into the latter category, and it's always useful to question whether those 'necessary annoyances' are actually necessary.It is, like you say, not always necessary to tackle those annoyances right now. But it is a situation where both the Campsite Rule and the Rule of Three have some domain. As a person whose entire job is about writing code to replace tedious and error-prone human tasks, you need to interrogate yourself any time you start thinking, \"This is my life now.\" Because if anyone has the power to say 'no', it's us.It's always worth spending 12-15 minutes most times you do a task that you have to do over and over again in service of trying to reduce the task from ten minutes to five or to zero. The reward for engaging in the task more fully rather than putting it off until it has to be done is that you're working toward a day when maybe you don't have to do it at all (you've automated it entirely or you've made it straightforward enough to delegate).Hal's example is so funny because he's using both arms to scoop in everything from Column A and Column B at the same time. Everybody gets a laugh. A couple of those tasks actually had to be done. A couple could have gone on the shopping list.reply",
      "I always saw it as being multiple subtasks deep into a problem, or opening too many parentheses. Yak shaving does not imply that you're wasting time, only that the task involves solving problems that feel remote to your initial objective.For example, I want to use ES6 modules on my website, then esbuild to compile them. However masonry.js breaks it, and instead of fixing it, I decided to get rid of it, but that breaks the layout of the /guides page, and while I'm there I might as well reorganise the list of guides.So now I'm on week 2 of the switch to ES6, but I ended up redesigning a page, writing a bunch of tests, fixing unrelated UI bugs, making a few UX fixes, making changes to the static site generator, etc etc.I get to do that because I'm self-employed and thinking long-term, but if I was at $PREVIOUS_EMPLOYER doing sprints, my boss would be wondering why I spent an entire sprint on this simple task.reply",

Even simple watching movies with DRM bullshit (Widevine) or using a Brave browser that is not in the FreeBSD Ports ... or running Linux games ... or CUDA workaround ... and no NopeVidia will not provide official CUDA support anytime soon.Also please remember that entire The Matrix (1999) movie was rendered [1] on FreeBSD machines in Linux Compat Layer because the software used to do that was not natively available on FreeBSD an yet it sill run faster on FreeBSD in Linux Compat Layer then natively on Linux. Let that sink in.Even today [2] playing Linux games in Linux Compat Layer is faster then natively on Linux - with more FPS and more 'stable' gameplay.Hope that helps.[1] https://freebsd.org/press/press-rel-1/[2] https://youtube.com/watch?v=lK6eRbz9DkMreply",

Then your GE Home app can monitor and control your minisplit via GE Cloud.I haven't done anything to analyze it further, instead after trying that out once I promptly changed my WiFi password and never looked back.

For my HVAC controls the design is converging to a round mechanical Honeywell thermostat for each hydronic zone with a \"smart\" thermostat (no cloud) wired in parallel--TBD whether buy vs build. For the minisplits I'm building my own thing that can speak their IR protocol, which will also double as a per-room temperature sensor. It all gets tied together with outdoor temp sensor via HomeAssistant. So if all the \"smart\" stuff fails, the trusty mechanical guy will keep the house from freezing.There are halfway decent hybrid controls available for ducted systems but you can't afaik buy anything off the shelf to merge hydronic + minisplits. And as far as I can tell, none of the off-the-shelf smart thermostats has any built in analog backup. I view that as absolutely critical for my use, if the power goes out and I'm not around I need to be 100% certain that when the power comes back on the heat will also.EDIT: Digging around a little more it seems that Mitsubishi H2i minisplit systems don't speak zwave or zigbee, neither does Haier Arctic. I'm not 100% sure if that's accurate, but I haven't been able to find any documentation in the affirmative or negative. Those are the two heat pump options available locally. I'll be remodeling a small barn into an ADU this summer, that project will be more amenable to a forced air hybrid system, so maybe I'll be able to get away with a Honeywell smart zigbee capable thermostat that can drive it.reply",

Before shutting down forever, though, the alternate branches of the tech tree leave some faint traces behind: over-optimistic sci-fi stories, outdated educational cartoons, and, sometimes, some obscure accessories that briefly made it to mass production before being quietly discontinued.The classical example of an abandoned timeline is the Glorious Atomic Future, as described in the 1957 Disney cartoon Our Friend the Atom.

      "For a K-8 environment, it might be worth looking into local e-waste recycling non-profits or university surplus programs. Often, large institutions rotate their hardware every 3-4 years, and they are usually happy to donate older but functional Chromebooks to schools in need. Also, check out 'DigitalEquity' initiatives in your area; they often have streamlined pipelines for this exact scenarioreply",
      "I realize this does nothing to solve your problem, but for the sake of discusion, internally at Microsoft, pretty much all the developers I know have switched to using \"Devbox\", which means we use a remote desktop client to access our dev machine.A lot of us resisted this at first, but then just kindof came to accept it, and it made it so we have a lot more capable machines to do development on than the laptops that we would have to recycle every couple years.I know there have probably been a lot of \"thin client\" products/services in the education space in the past, but I think it might be time to try again.Like another poster here, I think it's \"sad\" that kids are using laptops. Laptops have small screens and poor ergonomics.A thin client setup with a good keyboard, mouse and monitor could be better and more affordable / future proof.reply",

      "Laptops can be useful: they can (and should) be locked down, and there\u2019s lots of digital media that teaches effectively, probably even better than anything on paper.(EDIT: Actually, probably not better than paper. I remember a study that note-taking by hand produced significantly better scores than typing; moreover, drawing is easier on paper, and some assignments are better drawn. But laptops can still be useful, and some assignments (like coding) are better digital. So ultimately, I think laptops should be incorporated alongside pen-and-paper.)For 2) I agree with the general idea (\u201cstatic\u201d websites should never be slow), but the aforementioned digital media includes some that can run on low specs. Worst case, you can give students PDFs of physical assignments (with form elements to put answers); but I\u2019m sure there are some minimal websites with K-5 material.reply",
      "Laptops are NOT useful for any reason in a school classroom below the 9th grade or so. No, not even for test taking, educational videos, or interactive demos.Maybe for computer science classes, but even there I'd prefer to use shared desktop computers.There is a lot of research that shows that the depth of understanding the material directly depends on the amount of effort you put in. Or that actually writing down things by hand increases the amount of recall.And to add to this, it looks like fine motor skills also directly influence brain development and may improve the IQ. The association of higher IQ with better fine motor skills is now well-established, but it also might work in reverse.reply",

      "Office really chugged on the PCs of the time though. We can debate whether modern Excel actually delivers enough more value than historical Excel to justify being as more resource-hungry, thus slower to load, as it is. But historical Excel appears fast on modern hardware, even in emulation, because the CPU, RAM, and permanent storage have had 30 years to evolve since it was released. Contemporary 386s and 486s would not have been that snappy.reply",
      "I beg to differ.  I'm 55.Let's go back to say around 1994/5.  I've just got a job as the first dedicated IT bod for a pie factory near Plymouth (Devon not MA)!  Win 3.11 was pretty much everywhere and was almost reliable - patching wasn't really a thing then in the MS world.  By then Pentium (586) was a thing but the majority of machines were 80486, 80386s were still useful.  There were also the 386/486 SX/DX and DX2 and Cyrix and so on.The planning spreadsheets were a series of Lotus 1-2-3 jobbies with a lot of manual copy and pasting and I gradually ported it to a Excel VBA job.  To cut a long story short, I was running Win311 and Excel on a Pentium 75 with 16MB RAM, IDE HDD.  Excel was way quicker to start than on a modern PC running Win 11 with an SSD.Yes, a lot of things took a while but I ended up with a finite capacity plan in VBA for an entire factory that took less than five minutes per run.  That was for meat and dough prep, make, bake and wrap and dispatch for 150 odd finished product lines.  It generated a labour plan as well and ran totally to forecast (which it also did).  Pasties, sossie rolls etc are generally made to forecast - they take a while to get through the plant and have to be delivered into depot with enough code (shelf life) for the customer (store) to be able to sell them and the consumer to not be given a dose of the trots.  As reality kicked in, you input the actual orders etc and it refined the plan.OK not the best tool for the job but I hope I show that a spreadsheet back in the day was more than capable of doing useful things.  I've just fired up LO calc on my laptop with a SSD and it took longer than I remember old school Excel starting up or perhaps the same time.reply",

      "I did earn some bread with vba as well, and always advocate for efficiency, but I just opened a 12MB xlsx file in LO, and it took a couple of seconds on a 2024 thinkpad.As far as I remember, my Win 3.11 machine (a 486 DX with 4MB RAM and 30MB HDD) wouldn't be able to store or open such a file, let alone recognize the extension. Also, it would call the file 2026022~.XL~ or something. And it took more than a couple of seconds to load office programs for sure. It would take well over a minute to load a book from a 1.44MB floppy.Anyway, software and computers have come a long way and I'm grateful for it.reply",
      "This is just not true. The only chugging back then was reading from disks, and the entire Office suite was only a handful of 3.5\" floppies.  If you had already started Excel earlier, then it was likely still cached in RAM and would start nearly instantly. If not, then it was still only a few seconds.Now what was slow was actual computations. Like try running a big spreadsheet in Excel or counting words in a big Word document on that hardware. It takes a very long time, while on modern hardware it's nearly instant.reply",
