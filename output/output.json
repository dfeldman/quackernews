      "Let me start by saying (as someone who has written a few technical books of his own)\u2014Congratulations!I am sure you (assuming this is your first book) are learning that this is a labor of love, and I wish you the very best in this endeavor. You should be proud!I was exposed to \"data oriented programming\" thanks to Clojure\u2014wherein maps/sets are the constructs used to pass data (as plain data) around, with simple functions that work with the data, as opposed to the traditional OO (hello ORM) that mangles data to fit some weird hierarchy.Java's recent innovations certainly make this a lot easier, and I am glad someone is looking at propagating a much needed message.I will take a look at the book, but I wish you the very best.\n \nreply",
      "I am also very interested in how this work in practice. With OOP at least you know the shape of your data structure as opposed to the hash map as a mere container type.\n \nreply",
      "I am an OOP programmer going back to the late 80s (including the cfront days of C++), and a serious user of Python since 2007.In Python, I sometimes try data-oriented programming, using lists and dicts to structure data. And I find that it does not work well. Once I get two or more levels of nesting, I find it far too easy to get confused about which level I'm on, which is not helped by Python's lack of strong typing. In these situations, I often introduce objects that wrap the map or dict, and have methods that make sense for that level. In other words, the objects can be viewed as providing clear documentation for the whole nested structure, and how it can be navigated.\n \nreply",
      "Living this dream in Python right now (inherited a code base that used nasty nesting of lists & dicts). You don't strictly need to do OOP to solve the problem, but it really does help to have a data model. Using dataclasses to map out the data structures makes the code so much more readible, and the support for type hints in Python is good enough that you can even debug problems with the type system.\n \nreply",
      ">Once I get two or more levels of nesting, I find it far too easy to get confused about which level I'm onAuthor here, I agree with you. I have the working memory of a small pigeon.The flavor of data orientation we cover in the book leverages strongly typed representations of data (as opposed to using hash maps everywhere). So you'll always know what's shape it's in (and the compiler enforces it!). We spend a lot of time exploring the role that the type system can play in our programming and how we represent data.\n \nreply",
      "Given the strongly typed flavour of data oriented programming, I wonder if you have any thoughts on the \"proliferation of types\" problem. How to avoid, especially in a nominally typed language like Java, an explosion of aggregate types for every context where there may be a slight change in what fields are present, what their types are, and which ones are optional. Basically, Rich Hickey's Maybe Not talk.    record Make(makeId, name)\n    record Model(modelId, name)\n    \n    record Car(make, model, year)\n    record Car(makeId, modelId, year)\n    record Car(make, model)\n    record Car(makeId, modelId)\n    record Car(make, year)\n    record Car(makeId, year)\n    record Car(make, model, year, colour)\n    record Car(makeId, modelId, year, colour)\n    record Car(year, colour)\n    \n    ....\n \nreply",
      "Hickey is great at trash-talking other languages.  In the case of Car you might build a set of builders where you write   Car.builder().make(\u201cBuick\u201d).model(\u201cLeSabre\u201d).build()\n\nOr in a sane world code generate a bunch of constructors.In the field of ontology (say OWL and RDF) there is a very different viewpoint about \u2018Classes\u2019 in the objects gain classes as they gain attributes.  :Taylor_Swift is a :Person because she has a :birthDate, :birthPlace and such but was not initially a :Musician until she :playsInstrument, :recordedTrack, :performedConcert and such.  Most languages have object systems like Java or C++ where a Person can\u2019t start out as not a Musician but become one later like the way they can in real life.Notably in a system like the the terrible asymmetry of where does an attribute really belong is resolved,  as in real life you don\u2019t have to say it is primary that Taylor Swift recorded the Album Fearless or that Fearless was recorded by Taylor Swift.It\u2019s a really fascinating question in my mind how you create a \u2018meta object facility\u2019 that puts a more powerful object system on your fingers in a language like Java or Python,  for instance you can have something like   taylorSwift.as(Musician.class)\n\nwhich returns something that implements the Musician.class interface if   taylorSwift.isA(Musician.class)\n\nwhere   TaylorSwift instanceof MetaObject.class\n \nreply",
      "That one is pretty simple. You have a Car object with four fields. The types of the fields are, respectively Optional<Make>, Optional<Model>, Optional<Year>, and Optional<Colour>.Hickey makes it sound worse than it is.\n \nreply",
      "I haven't yet had the luxury to experiment with the latest version of Java, but this is one of the reasons why I wish Java introduced named parameters the say way kotlin and scala do.Eg:  data class Make(makeId: String, name: String)\n  data class Model(modelId: String, name: String)\n\n  data class Car(make: Make, model: Model, year: String, ...)\n\nNow you can go ahead and order the params whichever way you wish so long as you're explicitly naming them:  val v1 = Car(make = myMake1, model = myModel1, year = \"2023\", ...)\n  val v1 = Car(model = myModel1, make = myMake1, year = \"2023\", ...)\n \nreply",
      "I have a long convoluted answer to this.I love that talk (and most of Rich's stuff). I consider myself a Clojure fanboy that got converted to the dark side of strong static typing.I think, to some degree, he actually answers that question as part of his talk (in between beating up nominal types). Optionality often pops up in place of understanding (or representing) that data has a context. If you model your program so that it has \"15 maybe sheep,\" then... you'll have 15 \"maybe sheep\" you've got to deal with.The possible combinations of all data types that could be made is very different from the subset that actually express themselves in our programs. Meaning, the actual \"explosion\" is fairly constrained in practice because (most) businesses can't function under combinatorial pressures. There's some stuff that matters, and some stuff that doesn't. We only have to apply typing rigor to the stuff that matters.Where I do find type explosions tedious and annoying is not in expressing every possible combination, but in trying to express the slow accretion of information. (I think he talks about this in one of his talks, too). Invoice, then InvoiceWithCustomer, then InvoiceWithCustomerAndId, etc... the world that microservices have doomed us to representing.I don't know a good way to model that without intersection types or something like Rows in purescript. In Java, it's a pain point for sure.\n \nreply"

      "I've become increasingly convinced that the idea of averaging is one of the biggest obstacles to understanding things... it contains the insidious trap of feeling/sounding \"rigorous\" and \"quantitative\" while making huge assumptions that are extremely inappropriate for most real world situations.Once I started noticing this I can't stop seeing this almost everywhere- almost every news article, scientific paper, etc. will make clearly inappropriate inferences about a phenomenon based on the exact same mistake of confusing the average for a complete description of a distribution, or a more nuanced context.Just a simple common example, is the popular myth that ancient people died of old age in their 30s, based on an \"average life span of ~33 years\" or such. In reality the modal life expectancy of adults (most common age of death other than 0) has been pretty stable in the 70s-80s range for most of human history- the low average was almost entirely due to infant mortality.The above example is a case where thinking in terms of averages causes you to grossly misunderstand simple things, in a way that would be impossible even with basic common sense in a person that had never encountered the idea of math... yet it is a mistake you can reliably expect people in modern times to make.\n \nreply",

      "Hey HN, we recently fine-tuned the llama3.1 405B model on 8xAMD MI300x GPUs using JAX instead of PyTorch. JAX's advanced sharding APIs allowed us to achieve great performance. Check out our blog post to learn about the cool sharding tricks we used. We've also open-sourced the code: https://github.com/felafax/felafaxWe're a small startup building AI infra for fine-tuning and serving LLMs on non-NVIDIA hardware (TPUs, AMD, Trainium).Problem: Many companies are trying to get PyTorch working on AMD GPUs, but we believe this is a treacherous path. PyTorch is deeply intertwined with the NVIDIA ecosystem in a lot of ways (e.g., `torch.cuda` or scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function). So, to get PyTorch code running on non-NVIDIA hardware, there's a lot of \"de-NVIDIAfying\" that needs to be done.Solution: We believe JAX is a better fit for non-NVIDIA hardware. In JAX, ML model code compiles to hardware-independent HLO graphs, which are then optimized by the XLA compiler before hardware-specific optimization. This clean separation allowed us to run the same LLaMA3 JAX code both on Google TPUs and AMD GPUs with no changes.Our strategy as a company is to invest upfront in porting models to JAX, then leverage its framework and XLA kernels to extract maximum performance from non-NVIDIA backends. This is why we first ported Llama 3.1 from PyTorch to JAX, and now the same JAX model works great on TPUs and runs perfectly on AMD GPUs.We'd love to hear your thoughts on our vision and repo!\n \nreply",
      "I, and several others, had no problem running on PyTorch on AMD GPUs, with no code changes from CUDA. Check out MosaicML's blog posts: https://www.databricks.com/blog/training-llms-scale-amd-mi25...\n \nreply",
      "Ahh, interesting, will take a look!Curious what are the steps to run PyTorch on AMD (does it work out-of-box with PyTorch+rocm docker image)? Does torch.compile work smoothly?\n \nreply",
      "Yeah I would suggest taking a look at PyTorch on AMD before saying stuff like \"scaled_dot_product_attention is an NVIDIA CUDA kernel exposed as a PyTorch function\", because that is demonstrably false.Also, FWIW, I would suggest getting a small Llama 3.1 model training fast before trying to do a big 405B model -- faster to iterate and almost everything you'll learn on the small models will scale to the 405B.\n \nreply",
      "Does JAX have its own implementations of matmul, flash attention etc? Or does it use the ROCm implementations like PyTorch does? (e.g,. hipblaslt, Composable Kernel FA etc)Not too familiar with JAX, but the abysmal PyTorch training perf on MI300x is in large part attributable to the slow perf of the ROCm libraries it is using under the hood.\n \nreply",
      "How are you verifying accuracy for your JAX port of Llama 3.1?IMHO, the main reason to use pytorch is actually that the original model used pytorch. What can seem to be identical logic between different model versions may actually cause model drift when infinitesimal floating point errors accumulate due to the huge scale of the data. My experience is that debugging an accuracy mismatches like this in a big model is a torturous ordeal beyond the 10th circle of hell.\n \nreply",
      "When you say \"model versions\", do you mean different quantizations of the model? Then it's not floating point errors that accumulate. Different quantizations of the model are different models. People will call such a model something like Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct--q4_0, claiming that it's just a \"version\" of the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. But it's just a lie. It's not the same model, and you should not expect the same results. There is no reason to debug the differences, what exactly would you expect to find, and what action would you envision to take once you find what you are looking for? However, is the quantized version still a useful LLM? Absolutely. Most people don't have an A100 to run the original model, so a quantized version is better than nothing.\n \nreply",
      "Very fascinating, can you explain more about a time when this happened?Like what area was affected by fp errors, why were they introduced (was it like refactoring of pytorch code?), how was this determined to be the cause?\n \nreply",

      "Texas Instruments has FRAM in some of their microcontrollers. It's really pleasant to use. You write to it like any other part of RAM, the only difference being that the bytes stay where they are when you lose power. With something flash you need to be more careful with how you use it.\n \nreply",
      "I've been using it in a few projects at work as a replacement for flash backed serial RAM.  It drops right in, as it is pin and function compatible with other small SPI and I2C nvram and eeprom chips, and isn't really much more expensive in small capacities.\n \nreply",

      "FRAM seems great and I wonder why it's not used more.  TI has some MSP430 processors that include it, but when they went to the MSP432 (ARM architecture), they said something about a process incompatibility.  Some ARM or Risc-V processors with FRAM would be great.Any idea what the process issue is?  Would you say FRAM is on the decline?  Super low powered CMOS ram used to also be a thing, but I haven't seen that in a while either.Added: article mentions flash memory is $15/gbit.  I guess that is NOR flash?  NAND is way way cheaper, more like $15/terabit.Another question: is it reasonable to say that FRAM automatically implements secure erasure?  Like if you overwrite a cell, can you be sure that the old contents are gone?  With flash, you have to worry about stuff like sector remapping other the covers.Here's a 4 mbit Adafruit FRAM breakout, out of stock but smaller sizes are available: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4719TI MSP430FR5969 development board: https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430FR5969\nThat is a fancy MSP430 processor with 64KB of FRAM and 2KB of regular ram.  The board is $16.  The regular ram is I think a little bit faster than the FRAM and good for \"infinite\" write cycles instead of mere trillions, so I guess you need both.  They have a few more of these boards including one with 128KB of FRAM if I remember right.\n \nreply",
      "The metal ions from the ferroelectric material can contaminate the silicon production line. I read that they would manufacture the silicon die at one facility (i.e. make the transistors) and then do the rest of the fabrication (the ferroelectric material, top metal, etc.) at another facility to avoid contamination. Maybe that's the process incompatibility that you mentioned. I don't know if FRAM is on a decline or will hold on as a niche product.\n \nreply",

Our Voronoi diagram implicitly specifies the shape of the room using the distance from the Voronoi sites, thus facilitating the topological changes in the wall layout by moving these sites.

      "Disclaimer WP Engine Customer -I read the comments from Matt M yesterday, and it felt like a hit piece.I run a website for a couple scifi like conventions, we need cheap reliable hosting without me having to deal with the vagaries of running wordpress myself.I would have bought a product like WP Engine directly from Automattic, but AFAIK they dont offer one, this feel like lashing out at a competitor because they failed to enter a market segment, and now feel their lunch is being ate.I ran websites for a long time without any version control, and would have no problem doing it again, the benefit of WordPress is the semi-WYSIWYG editor and the plugin ecosystem.\n \nreply",
      "> Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg unleashed a scathing attack on a rival firm this week, calling WP Engine a \u201ccancer to WordPress.\u201dIn my experience, WordPress itself could be called a Cancer to the Web.The amount of new clients I've picked up who needed help rescuing broken and malware ridden WordPress sites is... well, it's more than I'd like as I really do not enjoy WordPress LOL\n \nreply",
      "I wonder to what extent that can be attributed to its ubiquity versus its quality. I've never worked with WordPress.For example, I notice that most of the automated \"attacks\" on my server are WordPress related. Is its defect rate significantly higher than other systems', or is it just that if you're going fishing you should bait for the most common fish? PHP and Apache come up a lot too.\n \nreply",
      "We had that problem in barebones WP with no plugins at all.Once we installed a few security plugins, it worked out just fine!\n \nreply",
      "And yet, reality is that for many companies, an off-the-shelf CMS is all they need, and all they can afford, and all they can figure out without hiring IT.Which means, if we want to kill WordPress, we need to offer a better solution. Not just for WordPress, but a coherent system that also reimplements the top hundred or so plugins.If anyone wants to join me rewriting it in Laravel so we could add a WSL-like layer for WordPress cancer plugins\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I wish someone would have the conversation. I don\u2019t even care whether it\u2019s Rust.\n \nreply",
      "Statamic for Laravel is pretty great for what it does.I wrote a WYSIWYG CMS for Laravel called Prodigy that I really enjoy but it hasn\u2019t gotten much market pick up.There\u2019s definitely some thinking in this area on how to move WP users toward Laravel.\n \nreply",
      "Statamic is awesome; watching Jack McDade in person at Laracon last month was great.However, Statamic is not a WordPress replacement. We need a system that can be installed, with hundreds of themes and plugins available, without touching code. An open-source Squarespace, basically.Statamic has a role, but not as a WordPress replacement for most people unfortunately\u2026\n \nreply",
      "> And yet, reality is that for many companies, an off-the-shelf CMS is all they needExcept they don't.  A static website would work for 99.9% of all businesses.The problem is that marketing wants a website that \"Doesn't look embarassing and has 5 nines uptime.\"Translation: \"Marketing wants a website that looks completely like our competitors(because reasons).  But make it completely different (because reasons)!  And make sure it's on AWS (because reasons)!\"Response from IT: \"Our website results in zero revenue to the company and is a gigantic security problem and spam magnet.  Here's the WP Engine credentials.  Now fuck off.\"\n \nreply",

      "This Ferranti Mark I computer is notable because, despite being one of the earliest electronic computers, its instruction set included 4 instructions that are now included in most modern ISAs, but which have been missing for many decades from the instruction sets of most later computers, with the exception of the supercomputers made by CDC and Cray.Those 4 instructions, with their mnemonics in the Intel/AMD x86 CPUs are:LZCNT (leading zero bits count), which was named \"The position of the most significant digit\" in this manual.POPCNT (population count), which was named \"Sideways adder\" in Mark I (it is listed in a table at the end of this manual).RDRAND (read random number), which was named \"The random numbers generator\" in this manual.RDTSC (read time stamp counter), \"The clock\" in this manual.It is said that some or even all of these less usual instructions had been suggested by Alan Turing himself to the designers of Ferranti Mark I.Another notable instruction of Ferranti Mark I was used to produce an audible beep, like the internal loudspeaker of the older IBM PC compatibles, \"The hooter\" in this manual.\n \nreply",

      ">Men in black always want popcount (it's been added to various architectures over the years at their request)I've heard this a few times, do you have anything that explains this?\n \nreply",
      "It is said that NSA has requested the addition of POPCNT to the Control Data Corporation CDC 6600 (1964), as a condition for procurement.The condition has remained in force later, so all its successors, like CDC 7600 (1969) or Cray-1 (1976), have included POPCNT.POPCNT has been added to the x86 ISA by AMD, in \"Barcelona\", in 2007, presumably because some customer for AMD Opteron has requested it. This happened during the period when the AMD server CPUs were much better than the Intel Xeons, so any wise customer was buying Opterons, not Xeons. Intel has followed AMD and it has added POPCNT to Nehalem, in 2008/2009 (for server CPUs, Nehalem has been the first that was better for any purpose than the AMD server CPUs, unlike for consumer CPUs, where Intel had surpassed AMD already since the middle of 2007, with Core 2).\n \nreply",

      "Back in my days as a CPU logic designer, I actually worked on a scientific mainframe where the MIB came by and said \"We'll buy some if you add a vector pop count.\"Anyway.... if you have cipher text that has been scrambled by a linear-feedback shift register, you can take two copies of the cipher text, shift one copy by N bits, XOR them together, and do a pop count on the result.  Repeat for bunch of different N's.  For some N that corresponds to the length of the LFSR the auto-correlation will be much better.   So now you have at least that to go on... of course you don't know the feedback equation and you don't know the initialization constant, but you have the start of a handle.\n \nreply",

To learn how to embed it, I decided to add Prolog support to Hellabot, a simple irc bot.Hellabot design requires to program its triggers using a two step process as described in the code below:Because the code to develop the trigger is in go, it requires to re-compile the bot every time a new trigger is created/updated. Because of this, embedding a language that can read the code externally is an attractive solution. In this case, I have selected Prolog due to being a flexible, high level language,  extremely well documented and ideal to parse text using Prolog\u2019s DCGs.Our strategy to remove the recompilation dependency, we will update bot to read Prolog code from a file that can be edited any time by the user. In this post, the Prolog code will be loaded when Hellabot triggers the even on message reception. This will allow the user to change the bot\u2019s logic without the need to recompile and redeploy t"
