      "The underlying idea is admirable, but in practice this could create a market for high-reputation accounts that people buy or trade at a premium.Once an account is already vouched, it will likely face far less scrutiny on future contributions \u2014 which could actually make it easier for bad actors to slip in malware or low-quality patches under the guise of trust.reply",
      "Users already proven to be trustworthy in one project can automatically be assumed trustworthy in another project, and so on.I get the spirit of this project is to increase safety, but if the above social contract actually becomes prevalent this seems like a net loss.  It establishes an exploitable path for supply-chain attacks: attacker \"proves\" themselves trustworthy on any project by behaving in an entirely helpful and innocuous manner, then leverages that to gain trust in target project (possibly through multiple intermediary projects).  If this sort of cross project trust ever becomes automated then any account that was ever trusted anywhere suddenly becomes an attractive target for account takeover attacks.  I think a pure distrust list would be a much safer place to start.reply",
      "Based on the description, I suspect the main goal isn't \"trust\" in the security sense, it's essentially a spam filter against low quality AI \"contributions\" that would consume all available review resources without providing corresponding net-positive value.reply",
      "Per the readme:> Unfortunately, the landscape has changed particularly with the advent of AI tools that allow people to trivially create plausible-looking but extremely low-quality contributions with little to no true understanding. Contributors can no longer be trusted based on the minimal barrier to entry to simply submit a change... So, let's move to an explicit trust model where trusted individuals can vouch for others, and those vouched individuals can then contribute.And per https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md :> If you aren't vouched, any pull requests you open will be automatically closed. This system exists because open source works on a system of trust, and AI has unfortunately made it so we can no longer trust-by-default because it makes it too trivial to generate plausible-looking but actually low-quality contributions.===Looking at the closed PRs of this very project immediately shows https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/pull/28 - which, true to form, is an AI generated PR that might have been tested and thought through by the submitter, but might not have been! The type of thing that can frustrate maintainers, for sure.But how do you bootstrap a vouch-list without becoming hostile to new contributors? This seems like a quick way for a project to become insular/isolationist. The idea that projects could scrape/pull each others' vouch-lists just makes that a larger but equally insular community. I've seen well-intentioned prior art in other communities that's become downright toxic from this dynamic.So, if the goal of this project is to find creative solutions to that problem, shouldn't it avoid dogfooding its own most extreme policy of rejecting PRs out of hand, lest it miss a contribution that suggests a real innovation?reply",
      "I suspect a good start might be engaging with the project and discussing the planned contribution before sending a 100kLOC AI pull request. Essentially some signal that the contributor intends to be a responsible AI driver not just a proxy for unverified garbage code.reply",
      "I think this fear is overblown. What Vouch protects against is ultimately up to the downstream but generally its simply gated access to participate at all. It doesn't give you the right to push code or anything; normal review processes exist after. It's just gating the privilege to even request a code review.Its just a layer to minimize noise.reply",
      "Did you experiment with getting an AI to critique incoming PRs, and ignoring ones where it finds clear red flags?reply",
      "And then they become distrusted and BOOM trust goes away from every project that subscribed to the same source.Think of this like a spam filter, not a \"I met this person live and we signed each other's PGP keys\" -level of trust.It's not there to prevent long-con supply chain attacks by state level actors, it's there to keep Mr Slopinator 9000 from creating thousands of overly verbose useless pull requests on projects.reply",
      "That is indeed a weakness of Web of Trust.Thing is, this system isn't supposed to be perfect. It is supposed to be better, while worth the hassle.I doubt I'll get vouched anywhere (tho IMO it depends on context), but I firmly believe humanity (including me) will benefit from this system. And if you aren't a bad actor with bad intentions, I believe you will, too.Only side effect is genuine contributors who aren't popular / in the know need to put in a little bit more effort. But again, that is part of worth the hassle. I'll take it for granted.reply",

If the author is reading this: have you tried Ghidra?That said, this seems a lot simpler than PC BIOSes in structure, as the latter are usually written in a combination of C and Asm (I can see why no one wanted to write MIPS Asm) and are self-extracting compressed archives.reply",

The decompiler goes to great lengths to produce assembly that is understandable and modifiable by replacing known constants, recognizing and replacing memory addresses with labels, inserting comments and function descriptions, marking function bounds, and many other niceties. In this article I'll describe the process of reverse engineering the structure and contents of the PROM so that I could build the decompiler.The Silicon Graphics O2 is a Unix workstation with a MIPS CPU.There are two families of CPUs available for the O2:In the early 2000s, members of the Nekochan community replaced the 300 MHz RM5200 and 350 MHz RM7000A CPUs with a faster 600 MHz RM7000C model.

      "Excellent debugging journey.If I were the author, I would skip the part about using the compiler explorer and reading the assembly. When I write C code, I need to satisfy the rules of the C language. Unless I\u2019m debugging the compiler or dealing with performance issues, my experience is that reading the generated assembler and understanding it is usually a slow way of debugging. The author eventually did compile with -fsanitize=undefined but I would honestly do that first. It prints a nice error message about the exact issue as the author has shown.reply",
      "I have to disagree. If you merely want to fix the problem, you can stop as soon as you find something that's awry and whose alteration removes the problem. But don't you want to understand the problem? Don't you want to see how the compiler can reasonably generate code that says a bool variable is true and false at the same time?reply",
      "It\u2019s about abstraction layers. Most of the time, understanding the generated assembler code isn\u2019t useful when it comes to understanding the problem. It satisfies my curiosity sure, but the problem is at the C level, an undefined behavior.Understanding what the C compiler generates is interesting, but without a corresponding intuition about the optimizer passes, such understanding is shallow and unlikely to be generalized to other problems in the future. You probably won\u2019t even remember this the next time you debug another undefined behavior. On the other hand, if you were to know the optimizer passes employed by the compiler and could deduce this code from that, then it is a useful exercise to enhance your intuition about them.reply",
      "I think it depends on your experience. I have a lot of experience from the Old Days\u2122 and from developing for microcontrollers, so I find reading assembly very natural and straightforward. When coding for the really small MCUs I've often had the disassembly generated and shown on another window every time I incrementally build, and can check and make sure it's what I was expecting to see.I do agree that knowledge of compiler optimizations is really important to working this way, though you'll eventually pick them up anyway. I don't see much value in looking at -O0 or -Og disassembly. You want the strongest stuff the compiler can generate if you're going to do this, which is usually either -O3 or -Oz (both of which are strong in their own ways). -O0 disassembly is... just so much pain for so little gain. Besides, -O3 breaks more stuff anyway!For someone without this level of experience (and who isn't interested in learning)... yeah, I can see why you'd want to do this another way. But if you've got the experience already, it's plenty fast enough.reply",
      "The thing is, you're gaining a bunch of knowledge about compiler internals and optimisations, but those aren't necessarily specified or preserved, so it's questionable how valuable that experience actually is. The next release of the compiler might rewrite the optimiser, or introduce a new pass, and so your knowledge goes out of date. And even if you have perfect knowledge of the optimiser and can write code that's UB according to the standard but will be optimised correctly by this specific compiler... would that actually be a good idea?All of that is less true in the microcontroller world where compilers change more slowly and your product will likely be locked to a specific compiler version for its entire lifecycle anyway (and certainly you don't have to worry about end users compiling with a different compiler). In that case maybe getting deeply involved in your compiler's internals makes more sense.reply",

Explicitly set the C standard to C17 or older, so the code is built using the custom boolean type.> Option 1) seemed like the easiest one, but it also felt a bit like kicking the can down the road \u2013 plus, it introduced the question of which standard to use.Arguably, that's the sanest one: you can't expect the old C code to follow the rules of the new versions of the language. In a better world, each source file would start with something like    #pragma lang_ver stdc89\n\nand it would automatically kick off the compatibility mode in the newer compilers, but oh well. Even modern languages such as Go miss this obvious solution.On the topic of the article, yeah, sticking anything other than 0 or 1 into C99 bool type is UB. Use ints.reply",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know that a large part of this is me holding it wrong, but I find it hard to justify the value of investing so much of my time perfecting the art of asking a machine to write what I could do perfectly well in less time than it takes to hone the prompt.You\u2019ve got to give it enough context - but not too much or it gets overloaded. You\u2019re supposed to craft lengthy prompts that massage the AI assistant\u2019s apparently fragile ego by telling it \u201cyou are an expert in distributed systems\u201d as if it were an insecure, mediocre software developer.Or I could just write the damn code in less time than all of this takes to get working.\"Well there's your problem. Nobody does roll-based prompts anymore, and the entire point of coding agents is that they search your code base, do internet searches, and do web fetches, as well as launch sub agents and use todo lists, to fill and adjust their context exactly as needed themselves, without you having to do it manually.It's funny reading people planatively saying, \"I just don't get how people could possibly be getting used out of these things. I don't understand it.\" And then they immediately reveal that it's not the baffling mystery or existential question there pretending it is for the purpose of this essay \u2014 the reason they don't understand it is that they literally don't understand the tech itself lolreply",
      "This just shows that the models (not AI, statistical models of text used without consent) are not that smart, it's the tooling around them which allows using these models as a heuristic for brute force search of the solution space.Just last week, I prompted (not asked, it is not sentient) Claude to generate (not tell me or find out or any other anthropomorphization) whether I need to call Dispose on objects passed to me from 2 different libraries for industrial cameras. Being industrial, most people using them typically don't post their code publicly, which means the models have poor statistical coverage around these topics.The LLM generated a response which triggered the tooling around it to perform dozens of internet searches and based on my initial prompt, the search results and lots of intermediate tokens (\"thinking\"), generated a reply which said that yes, I need to call Dispose in both cases.It was phrased authoritatively and confidently.So I tried it, one library segfaulted, the other returned an exception on a later call. I performed my own internet search (a single one) and immediately found documentation from one of the libraries clearly stating I don't need to call Dispose. The other library being much more poorly documented didn't mention this explicitly but had examples which didn't call Dispose.I am sure if I used LLMs \"properly\" \"agentically\", then they would have triggered the tooling around them to build and execute the code, gotten the same results as me much faster, then equally authoritatively and confidently stated that I don't need to call Dispose.This is not thinking. It's a form of automation but not thinking and not intelligence.reply"
