Note that this chapter appeared in the 2nd\r\n    edition of the book, not in the 1st edition.]\n\r\n        The previous chapter showed that it possible to discover a lot about a program without resorting to what is often called reverse engineering. Simply by examining a program's outward behavior, a utility such as INTRSPY shows, for example, that Windows\r\n        uses the undocumented DOS Get SysVars function, and that Microsoft's QuickC makes the weird SetPSP(0) and SetPSP(-1) calls that are discussed in chapter 4.\r\n    \n\r\n        But such external examination of a program's behavior can take us only so far. INTRSPY can't tell us why Windows calls Get SysVars \u2014 that is, which fields it uses in the SysVars data structure) \u2014 nor can INTRSPY tell us why\r\n"
