      "If you're going through all the effort to design a PCB have you thought about driving the I2S input digitally? I skimmed through the AD85050 datasheet and it has internal DSP functionality which would have been already tuned for the drivers and box by Marshall. The reason powered boxes sound decent despite their relatively cheap hardware is because of the extensive processing they have in the background to compensate for any hardware defiencies.As the AD85050 has a stereo I2S input there's a possibility for the actual crossover to be either done on the amp chip itself (with the same signal driving both channels) or done on the Amlogic SOC. The latter would be ugly as you would need another DSP chip on your board to do the crossover functionality, or perhaps you could program the AD85050 via I2C to add the appropiate low and high pass filters.A two channel A/D converter would work on the front end, as you could drive both channels with a single analog input to get a stereo I2S out with duplicate channels to drive the amp. A USB input would be much messier if you want true stereo using two speakers unless you plan on doing routing on the software side. With SPDIF you probably could get away with splitting the signal and using a SPDIF to I2S converter chip in each speaker, but you would still need some way to separate out the left and right channels. The AD85050 has mixing functionality via I2C which may help with that.And of course, all this might be more work than desigining an amp in the first place, and it really depends if you want to explore the analog or digital side of things.\n \nreply",
      "> The reason powered boxes sound decent despite their relatively cheap hardware is because of the extensive processing they have in the background to compensate for any hardware defiencies.I will not argue that that could be one ingredient, but a couple of months ago I did a toy for my kids, I bought decent speakers, placed them in a cheap plastic box, and was absolutely amazed bybthe sound quality. The amplifier is a sub 1 dollar class D bought in a Raspberry Pi shop. No processing at all. If the box is sturdy and sealed, and the speaker is good, is incredible what you can do.\n \nreply",
      "Most cheap amp ICs perform well when they're outputting less than a watt, with distortion barely audible. Try connecting the same amp board to your main HiFi system if you have one and do some listening tests against the original HiFi amp. Then turn it up and it's a completely different story.As always the speakers are the crucial part and having decent speakers will make a big difference. What a DSP can do is correct bad speakers to some degree. A typical cheap computer speaker has a muddy midrange, can't reproduce past 13 kHz or so, and has little bass due to the small driver. With DSP the manufacturer would typically low pass the amp input, smooth out the nonlinear frequency response, lift the bass a bit, and apply compression and limiting to increase perceived volume and protect the system. The results are still constrained by physics but the manufacturer is in this case able to save money on the drivers and box while getting similar sound quality.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, of course is not hifi. Not in any dreams, but for the price, being 2 orders of magnitude less money, impressive. Also in comparison with old little radios, much much much better.\n \nreply",
      "I'm interested in which speaker and amp those were. Also, the plastic box :)\n \nreply",

      "Not the OP, but if you have a little budget, HifiBerry's AMP2 [0] sounds great.

      "It's been shown that, at least for guitar speakers, the box they're in doesn't matter at all. The entirety of the sound quality or lack thereof is in speaker itself. Of course that is only one speaker , no crossover to worry about.\n \nreply",
      "That's entirely untrue, particularly at lower frequencies. This isn't audiophile cork-sniffing - the behaviour of a loudspeaker can be radically altered by the design of the enclosure. Entire textbooks have been written on the topic.https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Loudspeaker-Design-John-...\n \nreply",
      "Marshall speakers, from my experience, has a brand sound signature, and that tuning is not very optimal for every genre of music.Replacing the DSP with a simpler amplifier may allow to get more detailed sound from the drivers and the box themselves and may create a more pleasant listening experience.From what I have seen, the drivers seem pretty full-size for that box, and any disturbing sound characteristic can be tuned with a simple equalizer. A more dynamic approach might create audibly weird sound profile if done wrong.Modern DSPs are magic, but I still prefer an audio pipeline where things show their deficiencies and not hide things real-time.\n \nreply"

      "> Evaluating Constant ExpressionsThe examples are quite simple in the article but I believe more complex cases would significantly degrade the compiler speed (and probably the memory footprint as well) and would require a VM to leverage this.Which is probably assumed \"too complex\" to go into the standard.\nI'm not saying it's impossible, but I kind of understand why this would not go into any kind of standard.> Importing DeclarationsI wish C++ (or even C) would have gone into this direction instead the weird mess of what is defined for C++20.Additionally you might import module into some symbol, like:  #import \"string.c\" as str\n\nand every non-static symbols from the file can be accessed from like:  str.trim(\" Hello World \");\n\n> __import dex;This is totally tangential but I don't like when file paths are not explicit.

      "While the author has WAY more knowledge/experience than me on this and so I wonder how he would solve the following issues:Evaluating Constant Expressions- This seems really complicated...if you're working within a translation unit, thats much simplified, but then you're much more limited in what you can do without repeating a lot of code. I wonder how the author solves this.Compile Time Unit Tests- This is already somewhat possible if you can express your test as a macro, which if you add in the first point, then this becomes trivial.Forward Referencing of Declarations- I think there may be a lot of backlash to this one. The main argument against this is that it then changes the compiler from a one-pass to two pass compiler which has its own performance implications. Given the number of people who are trying to compile massive codebases and go as far as parallelizing compilation of translation units, this may be a tough pill for them to swallow. (evaluating constant expressions probably comes with a similar/worse performance hit caveat depending on how its done)Importing Declarations- This is a breaking change...one of the ways I have kind of implemented templating in C is by defining a variable and importing a c file, changing the variable, and then reimporting the same c file. Another thing I've done is define a bunch of things and then import the SQLite C Amalgamation and then add another function (I do this to expose a SQLite internal which isnt exposed via its headers). All of these use cases would break with this change.Are there any thoughts about these issues? Any ways to solve them perhaps?\n \nreply",
      "> if you're working within a translation unit, thats much simplified, but then you're much more limited in what you can do without repeating a lot of code. I wonder how the author solves this.You are correct in that the source code to the function being evaluated must be available to the compiler. This can be done with #include. I do it in D with importing the modules with the needed code.> This is already somewhat possible if you can express your test as a macro, which if you add in the first point, then this becomes trivial.Expressing the test as a macro doesn't work when you want to test the function. The example I gave was trivial to make it easy to understand. Actual use can be far more complex.> PerformanceD is faster at compiling than C compilers, mainly because:1. the C preprocessor is a hopeless pig with its required multiple passes. I know, I implemented it from scratch multiple times. The C preprocessor was an excellent design choice when it was invented. Today it is a fossil. I'm still in awe of why C++ has never gotten around to deprecating it.2. D uses import rather than #include. This is just way, way faster, as the .h files don't need to be compiled over and over and over and over and over ...D's strategy is to separate the parse from the semantic analysis. I suppose it is a hair slower, but it also doesn't have to recompile the duplicate declarations and fold them into one.Compile time function execution can be a bottleneck, sure, but that (of course) depends on how heavily it is used. I tend to use it with a light touch and the performance is fine. If you implement a compiler using it (as people have done!) it can be slow.> one of the ways I have kind of implemented templating in C is by defining a variable and importing a c file, changing the variable, and then reimporting the same c file.

All of these use cases would break with this change.I am not suggesting removing #include for C. The import thing would be additive.> Are there any thoughts about these issues?If you're using hacks to do templating in C, you've outgrown the language and need a more powerful one.

The only other solutions were multiple networks, which were created with multiple radios on different frequencies, and [edit: beam forming], which created different networks to different physical locations - if that actually worked in practice.Has anything changed? Are there new solutions to the circuit-switching limitation? Has someone managed to turn wireless into a packet-switched network?\n \nreply",
      "WiFi is a shared medium, but shared medium and circuit-switched are not the same thing. WiFi uses packets and conforming devices do not block other devices for any longer than the time to send a packet.\n \nreply",
      "That's a bit of an oversimplification. Access Points coordinate communication to ensure clients take turns, and Wi-Fi avoid collisions by having clients listen for an idle channel before transmitting and exponentially backing off if it's busy (CSMA/CA). So even when clients share the same frequency, it\u2019s not 'circuit-switched' since transmissions are managed dynamically. Clients wait for the AP to respond before sending additional data. And there's QoS features to ensure things like live voice take priority over a bulk download.Wi-Fi 6 adds OFDMA, which splits channels into sub-channels so multiple clients can transmit simultaneously, and MU-MIMO allows simultaneous streams to different clients. Beamforming helps too with directional signals.tl;dr; it is a shared medium but with lots of tech on top of it that mitigate much of the issues!\n \nreply",
      "You can multiplex by frequency as well.Also, modern wireless systems can even multiplex by location, using phased arrays, it will beam a spotlight of radio to your direction, and can noisy data from receiving phase information as well.\n \nreply",
      "How are those different than the multiple radios and beam forming (oops, I see I wrote something else) that I mentioned? I'm not being snarky; I'm trying to learn what I'm missing. Thanks.\n \nreply",

      "I've burnt out. It was horrible. I am doing much better now!The trick is to not care enough about your job to get hurt but not care so little that you could short-term be hurt.In many places if you get hurt/burnt out on the job the upper seats are looking for any reason to curb stomp you. There's no reason to give a company your all unless you have an actual stake in it or they are there to hold you up when you're dragging. I've worked at multiple places where influential people died, yes dead, below average life expectancy, - on the job - and corporate did everything they could to not even pay out on their legal obligations (life insurance, D&D). In some cases employees joked or snickered about the person who died later on - in meetings.In tech. I've found that you're not on your own but you are at the mercy of who is in charge of your schedule and rates your performance. If you lose trust in that person your best option is to leave as quickly as possible. Otherwise they will do what they can to destroy you for as much 'profit' as they can claim. Being clear. It is not about realized gains, it could even be at great detriment to a company. It is about short-term line item claimable gains. \"We got 4 good months out of her...\", \"they were terminal and now they will be working somewhere better for them...\", \"he really wasn't closing as many tickets as the rest of the team...\", \"they weren't helping as many team members as the rest of the team...\", \"we never needed someone with an advanced degree...\", etc.Check in with yourself regularly. Know the signs of burn out. The company you work for does not depend on any person caring about you in the slightest.\n \nreply",
      "> The trick is to not care enough about your job to get hurt but not care so little that you could short-term be hurt.It really depends on your personal psychology. After I burnt out in a demanding role that I adopted as a big part of my identity, I joined a new company vowing to not take work as seriously (I remember telling myself, \"if excess effort isn't rewarded, the optimal strategy is to maximize compensation, minimize necessary effort, and eliminate excess effort\").After a few months of recovery and ruminating on why I still felt so bad (plus therapy), I learned a few things about myself:1. I feel like garbage when I'm half-assing something at work or not giving my all -- especially when the people around me are putting in the work.2. When I am giving my all and I feel like I'm not being recognized, I begin to lose motivation and burn out. Simple tasks become very laborious. This is a gradual, months-long process that is difficult to recognize is happening.3. When I start to burn out, I am forced by my mind and body to half-ass things, which makes me more demotivated, which exacerbates the burnout.Putting these insights into action, I've so far been able to keep burnout at bay by finding roles where I can give work my all, receive recognition, and be surrounded by others who are putting in similar effort. This doesn't mean blindly trusting the company or destroying my work-life balance -- I believe that \"recognition for hard work\" includes proactively protecting hard workers from their workaholic tendencies and giving them the flexibility to take breaks. I'm lucky to work with really great people where I frequently pass along responsibilities or take work from others to avoid over-stressing any one person and enable things like multi-week vacations. I have no idea how I will change my approach if I lose this workplace dynamic or pick up more forcing functions on my workday (e.g. having kids) in the future, but it's working pretty well for me right now.All of this is to say: for me, the low-trust \"do the bare minimum to stay employed\" approach didn't actually help me get out of burnout into fulfillment -- What helped was finding a work situation where I could give my all and not feel taken advantage of. People are wired differently, so I want to caution against a one-size-fits-all approach.\n \nreply",
      "Yours has got to be one of the best comments that I've ever read on hacker news.> for me, the low-trust \"do the bare minimum to stay employed\" approach didn't actually help me get out of burnout into fulfillment -- What helped was finding a work situation where I could give my all and not feel taken advantage ofWhat you just described (so vividly) is meaning, and (likely) \"flow\" too. Meaning must be there for everyone, in their efforts; the need for meaning is universal. (We can call it intrinsic motivation too.)Some say that you can find meaning outside of work, and then can mostly ignore work; and it's also said (correctly I guess) that \"psychological richness\" (closely related to resilience) is important: drawing meaning & satisfaction from multiple sources.Sure, but I have a practical problem with that: if you need to work 8 hrs/day to cover your family's needs, you don't have time, energy, or opportunity left to find meaning elsewhere.And, as others have repeatedly said it here, if you are a full time employee making quite beyond your (family's) needs, and think about decreasing your working time (giving up excess money, but regaining much needed time & freedom), that is what is strictly forbidden by the runners of the Village of Happy People. You will find effectively no jobs that let you work (say) 5 hours per day, for 62.5% of your original salary. That way, you'd just not be a good slave, a good cog in the machine. Society is engineered such that you must not have free time.Therefore the only practical option is to find (or create) work that provides meaning for you intrinsically. I see no other option. You can be an employee or run your own business, the same applies. And, unfortunately, this is unattainable for most of society.\n \nreply",
      "I appreciate the kind words!The second part of your post is something I've thought about a lot. There are a lot of incentives driving business operators to try to get the most out of the fewest number of employees possible:- Less communication overhead due to fewer people- Constant availability (less need to pre-plan meetings, etc to match everyone's hours)- Less complexity WRT HR, payroll, taxes- Employees still have to pay for full healthcare, so the employer either provides this or pays a 1099 salary premium (the US's terrible approach of tying health insurance coverage to your employer rears its ugly head yet again)- Fewer SaaS seats to pay forSome of these are more solvable than others, and allowing more people to work part-time in tech is definitely swimming upstream, but I do wish more businesses would try.Sahil Lavingia (Gumroad) is one person leaning into this approach with great success: https://sahillavingia.com/work\n \nreply",

There's no good way for me to get from where I am to business owner\u2014either I'd be risking my family's livelihood on something uncertain or I'd be working in my free time to build a stable business instead of spending time with them.The compromise I've arrived at is that I give it my all during a very strict time box. I work remotely, so at 9am I start work, I take an hour for lunch, and I check out at 5. With no commute that leaves just over half my workweek waking hours for my family.During working hours I do it all\u2014I perform my job very well and am lucky enough to be in a place where it's recognized in very measurable ways (promotions, autonomy, and recognition).

      "Against all of the advice in the world, I'm trying to set things up to avoid basically everything described in the article. It's tricky because the truth is that a lot of the tactics work and that is why companies implement them. A lot of investors also consider that process to be best-in-class and look for it as a sign of maturity.The counter approach is:\n- Make complete information available as transparently as possible and don't gate it.\n- Be forthcoming about weaknesses. Don't force prospects and customers to find them.\n- Ensure that when a prospect or customer does want to talk to someone, they immediately reach someone who can handle the problem or answer the question (no need for escalations.)\n- Never have an AI agent call someone unless the customer specifically requests that and be sure that all AI agents immediately disclose that they are AI.\n- Offer flexible e-mail list subscription options (monthly, quarterly, annually, only release notes, etc.)\n- If the product is not a fit, try to offer something useful anyway such as a suggestion of another product that might be a better match for their needs.Value based pricing is one of the reasons why a lot of companies end up in these situations. Rather than setting a standard price, the company does a detailed investigation of the customer to try to find out how much value they will gain from using the product and then they set the price based on that determination.

(Apparently with Ruby there is the slight hint of adding the lazy method in between)Later I found out laziness in the whole system by default leads to some difficult issues, which quite a few people seem to agree with.

I was confused a little about the flame effect on the route before I realized it was matching my mouse on the other charts.I second the request to be able to visualize routes without timing, it'd be awesome to take some route I have planned out in caltopo and view it here.Also it seems like not quite what you're aiming for but I already have a few places I can (and sometimes do) upload these for the sharing/community/diary aspect (strava and peakery) and it would be cool to have some sort of integration where I could visualize activities from there without having to download/upload the GPX.

If you are visiting San Antonio you will definitely want to eat lunch there so that you can be in the shade during the hottest part of the day.But is it special enough to make it worth a trip to San Antonio just to see the it? No, probably not. You probably live near a river, and there are probably restaurants with a deck you can sit on while you eat lunch.

      "No Mexicans died for anyone's freedom, including their own or other Mexicans. They were serving under a dictator and didn't have a choice. (And, yes, there were some slaves in Texas, but comparatively few compared to the rest of the South.)The small force there knew they would eventually be massacred by the thousands of troops surrounding them. The defenders held them off for 13 days. When they requested parley, Santa Anna signaled no quarter. Legend has it that Davy Crockett was on the roof, fighting to keep the horde from coming up the ladder, but he died with the rest of them.Santa Anna ordered the execution of the six surviving prisoners of war. The Alamo defenders fought bravely and died in support of an idea: that men can govern themselves and live in freedom. It would take another 30 years before the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, would sign the Emancipation Proclamation and free the slaves.\n \nreply",
      "This is pretty revisionist. Slavery wasn't some ancillary factor that just happened to exist in Texas. It was core to the anglo side of the Texas revolution. The War Party was strongly proslavery and the increasing (Mexican) federal push towards abolition was a key point for them. They especially hated a Mexican predecessor to the Emancipation Proclamation called the Guerrero decree that (attempted to) free most slaves in the northern states. After independence, they wrote slavery into the constitution and some of the first laws passed prohibited slaveowners from freeing slaves without government approval. The events in Texas were just one of half a dozen revolutions opposed to Mexican federal centralization around the same time.None of this was politically palatable after the American Civil War and people certainly weren't going to focus on the non-anglo sides of the revolution that weren't so deeply proslavery, so the narrative that's taught in schools was sanitized.\n \nreply",

A lot of kids are indoctrinated with the BS that downplay the slavery aspect, it's like the Big Lie of the south.\n \nreply",
      "One of the nice things about growing up in Texas is that I 100% know what being the target of state-sponsored propaganda feels like.  The extra cool thing is that almost all the propaganda is pretty easy to refute and it is easy to access alternative (and IME more historically correct points of views) which aren't supressed by the state.That makes it a lot easier to understand the claim that folks often make, that any system is \"propaganda free\" when disagreements can be publicly stated with no governmental reprisal, is trivially false.At the same time, it's been pleasantly horrific to look at how objectively bad the reflexive assumptions most of my cohort hold about the world and then try to draw conclusions about how terrible and mistaken my own views have and probably continue to be.Thanks, Texas!\n \nreply",

      "English spelling could be significantly improved by adding a few optional accents. They could be purely additive: the ASCII spellings would remain valid for those who prefer to use them.Native English speakers don\u2019t seem to quite grasp how difficult the spelling is. I\u2019ve been using this language for thirty years and I sometimes forget how some basic words are pronounced because I mostly write it.There\u2019s no need to change physical keyboards. In the smartphone era, most English around the world is already being typed using soft keyboards and autocomplete. A spelling reform could be agreed between Google, Apple and Microsoft. They are the de facto equivalent of Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise for the English language, even if they don\u2019t use that power.Here\u2019s my basic suggestion for the optional accent marks:A long vowel is marked with an acute accent. The sound is simply the one you\u2019re familiar with from how the alphabet is pronounced. This lets us distinguish between l\u00e9ad (the verb) and lead (the metal), live (the verb) and l\u00edve (as in streaming), l\u00f3w and how, f\u00e9ar and bear, bl\u00e9ak and break, infinite and f\u00edn\u00edte, etc.It also fixes the spelling of many loan words that look like the final e would be silent and today you just have to know it\u2019s not: catastroph\u00e9, epitom\u00e9, Eurydic\u00e9, etc.This easy rule doesn\u2019t nearly cover all the weird vowel spellings, but it already fixes a substantial part of the worst obstacles for English learners.Two more accent marks could be deployed:The macron is already familiar to Japanese learners. It\u2019s a long version of the short vowel sound, as in \u014csaka. The spelling of many English loan words could be unified by deploying the macron consistently. It would allow replacing \u00e9 with \u0113 in French loan words like fianc\u0113.The grave accent could be used to assign a third vowel sound, but it\u2019s not as obvious what this should be. As an example, maybe for the letter A, it could be the sound in words like \u00e0ll and h\u00e0ul and \u00e0we. Again, the point would be to give a consistent and useful hint of a sound that doesn\u2019t follow the basic rules, not to make the spelling perfect in one stroke.\n \nreply",

The industrial megaproject is planned to be located just 5 to 11 kilometres from telescopes at Paranal, which would cause irreparable damage to astronomical observations, in particular due to light pollution emitted throughout the project\u2019s operational life. Relocating the complex would save one of Earth's last truly pristine dark skies.Since its inauguration in 1999, Paranal Observatory, built and operated by the Europe"

      "This needs (2015). Surely if ultrasound was effective in replicated studies we\u2019d have a treatment by now, right? Or have heard more about it?\n \nreply",
      "This assumes anyone attempted to replicate it or otherwise pursue it. I guess the question would be where are the studies that failed to replicate it.I have friends that work in the medical tech field. A device they started developing around 2009 is barely getting into the field now after animal trials and clinical trials around the globe. It's an extremely long process requiring a lot of capital. And you likely haven't heard of it either (it is pretty effective for treating some heart related issues).There are plenty of animal studies that show some promise that are simply abandoned for various reasons.All that said, I thought the hypothesis that those amyloids are the cause of Alzheimers hasn't really worked out, there were other drugs that targetted those and apparently didn't work that well.\n \nreply",

      "1Mhz ultrasonic _physical_ therapy devices are under $100, https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3810427/ (2012)> Applications of ultrasound in medicine for therapeutic purposes have been an accepted and beneficial use of ultrasonic biological effects for many years. Low power ultrasound of about 1 MHz frequency has been widely applied since the 1950s for physical therapy.. In this overview, the Bioeffects Committee outlines the wide range of therapeutic ultrasound methods, which are in clinical use or under study, and provides general guidance for assuring therapeutic ultrasound safety.\n \nreply",

      "> Transgenic mice with increased amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) productionLooks to me they increased amyloid-B then removed the increase, which solved symptoms. I don't know much about this but my understanding was that Alzheimer disease had to have a bit more going on than just amyloid-B accumulation.\n \nreply",
      "Yes that is the major potential problem with this type of mouse model in general. Mice are modified to have a condition that resembles something like alzheimer's disease and then treatments are tested, but there's no guarantee that the underlying disease is actually the same, so if the condition that is induced in the mice is just a symptom rather than the underlying cause of the human disease, or just superficially resembles it, the treatment may not actually be effective in humans.\n \nreply"
