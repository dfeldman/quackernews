      "This is really coolOne thing I'd suggest, for any hardware product, is that when doing your bill of materials to provide links and show estimated costs. Sure, these will change but having a rough idea of the costs is really helpful, especially when perusing on from things like HN. It can be a big difference for someone to decide if they want to try it on their own or not. It is the ballpark figures that matter, not the specifics.You did all that research, write it down. If for no one but yourself! Providing links is highly helpful because names can be funky and helps people (including your future self) know if this is the same thing or not. It's always noisy, but these things reduce noise. Importantly, they take no time while you're doing the project (you literally bought the parts, so you have the link and the price). It saves yourself a lot of hassle, not just for others. Document because no one remembers anything after a few days or weeks. It takes 10 seconds to write it down and 30 minutes to do the thing all over again, so be lazy and document. I think this is one of the biggest lessons I learned when I started as an engineer. You save yourself so much time. You just got to fight that dumb part in your head that is trying to convince you that it doesn't save time. (Same with documenting code[0])Here.

      "> So if you as an app developer include such a 3rd party SDK in your app to make some money \u2014 you are part of the problem and I think you should be held responsible for delivering malware to your users, making them botnet members.I suspect that this goes for many different SDKs. Personally, I am really, really sick of hearing \"That's a solved problem!\", whenever I mention that I tend to \"roll my own,\" as opposed to including some dependency, recommended by some jargon-addled dependency addict.Bad actors love the dependency addiction of modern developers, and have learned to set some pretty clever traps.\n \nreply",

      "Elaborate on this please.  It seems a great boon in having pushed the OO world towards more functional principles, but I'm willing to hear dissent.\n \nreply",
      "How is dependency injection more functional?My personal beef is that most of the time it acts like hidden global dependencies, and the configuration of those dependencies, along with their lifetimes, becomes harder to understand by not being traceable in the source code.\n \nreply",
      "Dependency injection is just passing your dependencies in as constructor arguments rather than as hidden dependencies that the class itself creates and manages.It's equivalent to partial application.An uninstantiated class that follows the dependency injection pattern is equivalent to a family of functions with N+Mk arguments, where Mk is the number of parameters in method k.Upon instantiation by passing constructor arguments, you've created a family of functions each with a distinct sets of Mk parameters, and N arguments in common.\n \nreply",
      "> Dependency injection is just passing your dependencies in as constructor arguments rather than as hidden dependencies that the class itself creates and manages.That's the best way to think of it fundamentally. But the main implication of that which is at some point something has to know how to resolve those dependencies - i.e. they can't just be constructed and then injected from magic land. So global cradles/resolvers/containers/injectors/providers (depending on your language and framework) are also typically part and parcel of DI, and that can have some big implications on the structure of your code that some people don't like. Also you can inject functions and methods not just constructors.\n \nreply",
      "I don't understand what you're describing has to do with dependency injection. See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43740196.\n \nreply",
      "> Dependency injection is just passing your dependencies in as constructor arguments rather than as hidden dependencies that the class itself creates and manages.This is all well and good, but you also need a bunch of code that handles resolving those dependencies, which oftentimes ends up being complex and hard to debug and will also cause runtime errors instead of compile time errors, which I find to be more or less unacceptable.Edit: to elaborate on this, I\u2019ve seen DI frameworks not be used in \u201centerprise\u201d projects a grand total of zero times. I\u2019ve done DI directly in personal projects and it was fine, but in most cases you don\u2019t get to make that choice.Just last week, when working on a Java project that\u2019s been around for a decade or so, there were issues after migrating it from Spring to Spring Boot - when compiled through the IDE and with the configuration to allow lazy dependency resolution it would work (too many circular dependencies to change the code instead), but when built within a container by Maven that same exact code and configuration would no longer work and injection would fail.I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not one of those weird JDK platform bugs but rather an issue with how the codebase is compiled during the container image build, but the issue is mind boggling. More fun, if you take the .jar that\u2019s built in the IDE and put it in the container, then everything works, otherwise it doesn\u2019t. No compilation warnings, most of the startup is fine, but if you build it in the container, you get a DI runtime error about no lazy resolution being enabled even if you hardcode the setting to be on in Java code: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/api/kotlin/spring-boot-pr...I\u2019ve also seen similar issues before containers, where locally it would run on Jetty and use Tomcat on server environments, leading to everything compiling and working locally but throwing injection errors on the server.What\u2019s more, it\u2019s not like you can (easily) put a breakpoint on whatever is trying to inject the dependencies - after years of Java and Spring I grow more and more convinced that anything that doesn\u2019t generate code that you can inspect directly (e.g. how you can look at a generated MapStruct mapper implementation) is somewhat user hostile and will complicate things. At least modern Spring Boot is good in that more of the configuration is just code, because otherwise good luck debugging why some XML configuration is acting weird.In other words, DI can make things more messy due to a bunch of technical factors around how it\u2019s implemented (also good luck reading those stack traces), albeit even in the case of Java something like Dagger feels more sane https://dagger.dev/ despite never really catching on.Of course, one could say that circular dependencies or configuration issues are project specific, but given enough time and projects you will almost inevitably get those sorts of headaches. So while the theory of DI is nice, you can\u2019t just have the theory without practice.\n \nreply"

And just now, I've seen numerous news and government sites that do not have CAA enabled... making them vulnerable to issuance bugs like this on CAs they may never have heard of, and thus making their readership/constituencies vulnerable to misinformation and fraud, especially in the context of a potential multifaceted attack against router infrastructure to perform MITM attacks at scale.Of course, you'll want to make sure you don't accidentally disavow an important subdomain where an engineer used a different CA than your usual suspects. But looking at all historic issuers for your domain hierarchies on transparency logs using e.g. https://crt.sh/ might be a good place to start.It's also good to monitor certificate transparency logs, but then the onus is on your security team to react if an incident occurs. Proactive controls are vital as well, and IMHO CAA avoids many of the downsides of pinning.\n \nreply",
      "The CAA whitelist is still enforced by the CAs themselves, so a malicious, compromised or buggy CA could ignore it. You still have to monitor CT. CAA mostly does two things:1. It makes sure that nobody accidentally issues a cert from another CA (giving you better control, avoiding the \"an engineer used a different CA\" scenario, and meaning that if you see a cert from another CA, you know it's something Very Not Good).2. It gives you a chance that an attacker able to bypass some but not all controls on a crappy CA won't be able to use that CA to get a cert for your site (if they don't manage to somehow also bypass the CAA check).I'm not sure whether CAA would have prevented this CA from issuing for this domain. I think it's more likely than not, but not certain, that it would have helped in this case.\n \nreply",
      "Domain owners may find my CAA record generator <https://sslmate.com/caa/> useful, as it can automatically generate a CAA policy that covers all the certificates found in CT logs for your domain. It's not always obvious how to translate from issuer name to CAA domain (due to white labeled intermediates); my tool consults CCADB data to determine the correct CAA domain.\n \nreply",
      "I always wonder who/what checks if CAs respect CAA. I know some browsers now check the certificate transparency log, but are there any that check the CAA record against the issuer of the certificate?\n \nreply",
      "No, because the CAA record only has to be in place at the time of issuance, rather than the whole lifetime of the certificate.Even if the semantics of CAA were changed, the challenges described in paragraph 3 of this post would apply: https://www.imperialviolet.org/2015/01/17/notdane.html\n \nreply",

      "Sure, gmail.com might be excluded, but its still a massive hole for a few reasons.This would affect ANY email provider who offers public email addresses. While I agree gmail.com is probably excluded (and maybe this doesn't bypass CAA -- maybe it does) there's a whole additional surface of anyone who has an email at any big enterprise getting a certificate for their domain.Even if I work at google.com, therefore have a google.com email, I should absolutely not be able to get a certificate for google.com just by getting an email at that company.I doubt it's even /that hard/ to buy an email account at a big company like that in the underground world, it seems like they are valuable generally and any company with 200k employees is going to have some leaks. This massively increases the attack surface of a simple leaked email account (which might otherwise have very little or no access).Crazy crazy oversight that has huge implications and is so easy to carry out that I would not be surprised if this was actually exploited by bad actors.\n \nreply",

Something goes wrong or just gets too far \"out of spec\"? Miscarriage. After a few months, the body goes so far as to sedate the mother and child before terminating the pregnancy. There is research claiming it actually shuts down the baby's nervous system before decoupling.But about a month before birth things switch around. The womb partially disconnects from control systems of the mother's body and ... there's an extremely scary way of pointing this out I once heard from a medical professor: \"you know just about the only thing a human body can still do when it's decapitated? It can give birth\"In less extreme circumstances, you actually have a switch in your circulatory system ... when pregnancy gets to this point and the mother's body loses power, it will initiate a rapid birthing process, and start shutting down organ after organ to give birth with the remaining power. That includes, eventually, the brain. Only the heart, lungs, liver and womb will remain operational. The body will shut down blood flow to the brain to continue giving birth. Once shut down it cannot be turned back on. So this kills the mother, despite the body remaining functional, in some reported cases, for over an hour, and is something gynaecologists get trained to prevent from happening.Given how common it was even a century ago for women to die giving birth, one wonders how often this mechanism was involved.\n \nreply",

If you're exhausting the context window, I would not be surprised if you're seeing high cost.Be aware of the \"cache\".Tell it to read specific files (and only those!), if you don't, it'll read unnecessary files, or repeatedly read sections of files or even search through files.Avoid letting it search - even halt it. Find / rg can have a thousands of tokens of output depending on the search.Never edit files manually during a session (that'll bust cache). THIS INCLUDES LINT.The cache also goes away after 5-15 minutes or so (not sure) - so avoid leaving sessions open and coming back later.Never use /compact (that'll bust cache, if you need to, you're going back and forth too much or using too many files at once).Don't let files get too big (it's good hygiene too) to keep the context window sizes smaller.Have a clear goal in mind and keep sessions to as few messages as possible.Write / generate markdown files with needed documentation using claude.ai, and save those as files in the repo and tell it to read that file as part of a question.\nI'm at about ~$0.5-0.75 for most \"tasks\" I give it.

Of the future actions discussed at the end, this one seems most important to me:> Investigate a solid-state replacement for the LaserDisc players.Those laserdisc players are cantankerous, mechanical beasts and even the industrial grade ones will likely be a constant point of failure across enough 80-hour operating weeks. While laserdisc based games were fairly rare, in the aggregate there were still quite a few notable titles made (led by Dragon's Lair (1983)).It would be terrific for the preservation community if someone made a solid state replacement based on an SBC like a Raspberry Pi. Fortunately, most of the games used a handful of fairly standardized serial protocols to communicate with the disc player. It doesn't seem like it would be too hard, especially using FFMPEG to drive the actual playback and the serial input could have a scriptable command parsing and translation layer.

The goal is to compute $D = \\alpha * A * B + \\beta * C$, as fast as possible. In this equation $D,A,B$ and $C$ are large matrices full of half precision floating point numbers, and $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ are constants. This problem is usually referred to as a Half-precision Generalized Matrix Multiply, or HGEMM for short.Tensor Cores are specialized hardware units on NVIDIA chips that implement a small matrix multiplication in hardware. I recently became interested in tensor cores for two reasons. First, it seems like most generative AI training and inference these days happens on A100s and H100s. Second, all of this training and inference is almost certainly running on the tensor cores of these devices, because they offer a massive throughput increase for matrix math as compared to what you get if you dont use them.
