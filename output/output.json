      "Claude for Chrome seems to be walking right into the \"lethal trifecta.\" https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/\"The lethal trifecta of capabilities is:\"\u2022 Access to your private data\u2014one of the most common purposes of tools in the first place!\u2022 Exposure to untrusted content\u2014any mechanism by which text (or images) controlled by a malicious attacker could become available to your LLM\u2022 The ability to externally communicate in a way that could be used to steal your data (I often call this \u201cexfiltration\u201d but I\u2019m not confident that term is widely understood.)If your agent combines these three features, an attacker can easily trick it into accessing your private data and sending it to that attacker.reply",
      "I built a very similar extension [1] a couple of months ago that supports a wide range of models, including Claude, and enables them to take control of a user's browser using tools for mouse and keyboard actions, observation, etc. It's a fun little project to look at to understand how this type of thing works.It's clear to me that the tech just isn't there yet. The information density of a web page with standard representations (DOM, screenshot, etc) is an order of magnitude lower than that of, say, a document or piece of code, which is where LLMs shine. So we either need much better web page representations, or much more capable models, for this to work robustly. Having LLMs book flights by interacting with the DOM is sort of like having them code a web app using assembly. Dia, Comet, Browser Use, Gemini, etc are all attacking this and have big incentives to crack it, so we should expect decent progress here.A funny observation was that some models have been clearly fine tuned for web browsing tasks, as they have memorized specific selectors (e.g. \"the selector for the search input in google search is `.gLFyf`\").[1] https://github.com/parsaghaffari/browserbeereply",
      "It is kind of funny how the systems are set up where there often is dense and queryable information out there already for a lot of these tasks, but these are ignored in favor of the difficult challenge of brute forcing the human consumer facing ui instead of some existing api that is designed to be machine readable already. E.g. booking flights. Travel agents use software that queries all the airlines ticket inventory to return flight information to you the consumer. The issue of booking a flight is theoretically solved already by virtue of these APIs that already exist to do just that. But for AI agents this is now a stumbling block because it would presumably take a little bit of time to craft out a rule to cover this edge case and return far more accurate information and results. Consumers with no alternative don't know what they are missing so there is no incentive to improve this.reply",
      "To add to this, it is even funnier how travel agents undergo training in order to be able to interface with and operate the \u201cmachine readable\u201c APIs for booking flight tickets.What a paradoxical situation now emerges, where human travel agents still need to train for the machine interface, while AI agents are now being trained to take over the human jobs by getting them to use the consumer interfaces (aka booking websites) available to us.reply",
      "This is a massive problem in healthcare, at least here in Canada. Most of the common EMRs doctors and other practitioners use either don\u2019t have APIs, or if APIs exist they are closely guarded by the EMR vendors. And EMRs are just one of the many software tools clinics have to juggle.I\u2019d argue that lack of interoperability is one of the biggest problems in the healthcare system here, and getting access to data through the UI intended for humans might just end up being the only feasible solution.reply",
      "It's because of legacy systems and people who basically have a degenerate attitude toward user interface/ user experience.  They see job security in a friction heavy process.  Hence the \"brute forcing\".. easier that than appealing to human naturereply",
      "Dude you do not understand how bad those \"APIs\" are for booking flights. Customers of Travelport often have screen reading software that reads/writes to a green screen. There's also tele-type, but like most of the GDS providers use old IBM TPF mainframes.I spent the first two years of my career in the space, we joked anything invented post Michael Jackson's song Thriller wasn't present.reply",
      "Those APIs aren't generally available to the public, are they?reply",
      "Not always, but anthropic is not exactly the public either.reply",
      "Just dumping the raw DOM into the LLM context is brutal on token usage. We've seen pages that eat up 60-70k tokens when you include the full DOM plus screenshots, which basically maxes out your context window before you even start doing anything useful.We've been working on this exact problem at https://github.com/browseros-ai/BrowserOS. Instead of throwing the entire DOM at the model, we hook into Chromium's rendering engine to extract a cleaner representation of what's actually on the page. Our browser agents work with this cleaned-up data, which makes the whole interaction much more efficient.reply"

Partly because the very small team that developed it knew the stack inside and out, and could do whatever needed to be done, in a smart way.)(Meanwhile, say, a consulting firm-led team who got a contract for a comparably complex system, and billed for 10 or 100 times the seat-warmers, with huge and ridiculously complex stacks they didn't understand... would just flounder, focus on appearances in sprint tasks, and churn out things implemented in poor ways, and with a large number of vulnerabilities, and probably take a lot longer before they could deliver a system that would survive the first day of use.)reply",

      "It looks cool but I feel this kind of tool is only useful if Ruby is the only language you use. I have to manage several runtimes for most projects. I've used asdf for years and recently switched to mise: these tools already download pre compiled binaries for Ruby, plus pretty much any other language runtime.It's likely that you get better per language features for something specific to the language though. We end up in exactly the same kind of frustration, that for some random project you need this specific tool that does dependency management of the specific runtime. asdf and mise both respect a .tool-versions file, I'd rather see things go more in that direction with some kind of standard.reply",
      "A flake.nix file plus a direnv `.envrc` file with `use flake` has solved this for me.When I cd into a project directory I get all of the tools that project needs, at the exact versions they were tested with. When I cd out of the directory, they go away. If the dependencies are well behaved (e.g. they don't do any self-modification, which is annoyingly common in the npm world) then it's often pretty easy to track all of your deps this way, imported from your npm package-lock.json or similar.Ask your favorite LLM to write your flake.nix file for you, they're pretty good at it. I've been able to drop all of the bespoke language-specific tool versioning stuff `nvm`, `uv`, `rvm`, etc for all my personal projects, and it makes it easy to add deps from outside the language-specific package managers, like ffmpeg and lame.reply",
      "If you still want to package your stuff natively for the language ecosystem, you still need all the usual metadata and you also want to specify version constraints for your dependencies and so on.Typically I wire up something like uv or rv (or Poetry or Bundler, which are fine but slower) to shell activation using Devenv, then autogenerate the Nix package from the language-native dependency specification files.reply",
      "This is the way. Nix, despite all of its issues, is still the best for reproducible developer environments. I just don't write my own flakes anymore.reply",

It doesn\u2019t just manage your ruby versions, it installs pre-compiled rubies so you don\u2019t have to wait for ruby to compile from source every time.

      "I\u2019ll be honest: there is a very good chance this won\u2019t work .... At the same time, the China concerns are real, Intel Foundry needs a guarantee of existence to even court customers, and there really is no coming back from an exit. There won\u2019t be a startup to fill Intel\u2019s place. The U.S. will be completely dependent on foreign companies for the most important products on earth, and while everything may seem fine for the next five, ten, or even fifteen years, the seeds of that failure will eventually sprout, just like those 2007 seeds sprouted for Intel over the last couple of years. The only difference is that the repercussions of this failure will be catastrophic not for the U.S.\u2019s leading semiconductor company, but for the U.S. itself.Very well argued. It's such a stunning dereliction the US let things get to this point. We were doing the \"pivot to Asia\" over a decade ago but no one thought to find TSMC on a map and ask whether Intel was driving itself into the dirt? \"For want of a nail the kingdom was lost\" but in this case the nail is like your entire metallurgical industry outsourced to the territory you plan on fighting over.reply",
      "If I may add my view as a formerly high-achieving semiconductor worker that Intel would benefit greatly from having right now, a lot of us pivoted to software and machine learning to earn more money.  My first 2 years as a software engineer earned me more RSUs than a decade in semiconductors.  Semiconductors is not prestigious work in the U.S., despite the strategic importance.  By contrast, it is highly respected and relatively well remunerated in the countries doing well in it.From this lens, the silver lining of the software layoffs going on may be to stem the bleeding of semiconductor workers to the field.

      "I'd say that VC funding may be an inappropriate tool for that. VCs want you to either grow fast, or fail fast. Not necessarily to bring profit fast, but to visibly capture the market (see Uber). Move fast, break things, rework things every week, trigger that wave of sign-ups.Agriculture is much slower, every iteration may be is a year, or (in tropical climates) half a year. Microelectronics is comparably slow, and even more unforgiving about making mistakes. Building robots does not scale ls easily as producing chips, let alone software.These areas need a different model of investment, with a longer horizon, slower growth, less influence of fads, better understanding of fundamentals. In some areas, DARPA provided such investment, with a good rate of success.reply",

      "I'd reframe that slightly. There is a vast foundation of stable, optimized businesses that are in commoditized/low-growth ares. They function as the underpinnings of the American economy.When turning the spotlight to capital that is seeking returns, it is true that these areas may be mediocre places to deploy fresh capital, but it doesn't mean that these players aren't competing, and they will probably be cranking out sheet metal and port cargo logistics optimization well after 90% of the AI startups fold.The caveat is of course Private Equity, which is about 10 trillion in assets. They can derive high returns from these areas, but it requires leverage.reply",

It also ends up with a lot of duds, but it's OK by them.What VC capital is not interested in is regular fuel, which can burn steadily and expand gradually, without a shock wave. Such companies can be quite important. Say, GitHub was such a company for many years, before it took a large VC investment and got acquired MS. Investing in such companies requires much more diligence and foresight, maybe too much predictive power to work at mass scale.VCs' math only works because a single 1000x hit easily pays for a hundred of duds. If ROI per hit is 2-3x, and research required is 10x more deep, the prospects likely start to seem too bleak for folks with billions seeking return.reply"

      "Several years ago I had the opportunity to observe when a detective came to a magistrate's office to petition for a search warrant. The warrant sought to search the contents of a person's phone, essentially without any limitations. The alleged crime was assault and battery on a family member. When asked \"What is your probable cause that the phone is likely to contain evidence of the commission of this crime?\" the detective had basically nothing to say (having put nothing to that effect in the affidavit for the search warrant) other than some vague (cooked up on the spot?) statements about the \"mobile nature of our modern society and the fact that cell phones are everywhere and everyone has one.\" The magistrate denied the warrant, but it's a sad testament to the propensity of law enforcement to cut corners that that search warrant affidavit was far from the last one I saw that targeted the cell phone of an accused and claimed that it was necessary to search the entire contents of the phone.reply",

There's just too much information on any given cell phone to be able to go through it all. So, in the end, their fishing expeditions end up being a waste of time and resources.reply",

If a warrant was issued to dump the full contents of your phone, and they used location metadata from your photo library to start determining other locations to search and got warrants for those, then that entire chain of evidence gets thrown out if the court finds the initial warrant for your phone was invalid.reply",

      "If they have a warrant that adheres to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment, then anything they might find that it outside the scope of the warrant would be illegally seized.

      "I've been planning to build something like this for a while now (just for myself). Love the planning workflow, will likely steal that idea.But code review is more than just reviewing diffs. I need to test the code by actually building and running it. How does that critical step fit in to this workflow? If the async runner stops after it finishes writing code, do I then need to download the PR to my machine, install dependencies, etc. to test it? Major flow blocker for me, defeats the entire purpose of such a tool.I was planning to build always-on devcontainers on a baremetal server. So after Claude Code does its thing, I have a live, running version of my app to test alongside the diffs. Sort of like Netlify/Vercel branch deploys, but with a full stack container.Claude Code also works far better in an agentic loop when it can self-heal by running tests, executing one-off terminal commands, tailing logs, and querying the database. I need to do this anyway. For me, a mobile async coding workflow needs to have a container running with a mobile-friendly SSH terminal, database viewer, logs viewer, lightweight editor with live preview, and a test runner. Diffs just don't cut it for me.I do believe that before 2025 is over we will achieve the dream of doing real software engineering on mobile. I was planning to build it myself anyway.reply",

      "Great pitch, you've articulated the pain point super well and I agree with it.I have personally had no luck with prompting models to ask me clarifying questions.  They just never seem to think of the key questions, just asking random shit to \"show\" that they planned ahead.  And they also never manage to pause halfway through when it gets tough and ask for further planning.My question is how well you feel it actually works today with your tool.reply",
      "Honestly, it's not there yet and I'm iterating to making it better and consistent. But, I've had a few moments where it got questions and implementations right and it felt magical. So, wanted to share it with more people and see how people like the approach.reply",
      "I think this is a neat approach. When I interact with AI tooling, such as Claude Code, my general philosophy has been to maintain a strong opinion about what it is that I actually want to build. I usually have some system design done or some picture that I've drawn to make sure that I can keep it straight throughout a given session. Without that core conception of what needs to be done, it's a little too easy for an LLM to run off the rails.This dialogue-based path is a cool way to interact with an existing codebase (and I'm a big proponent of writing and rewriting). At the very least you're made to actually think through the implications of what needs to be done and how it will play with the rest of the application.How well do you find that this approach handles the long tail of little things that need to be corrected before finally merging? Does this approach solve the fiddly stylistic errors that need to be made on its own, or is it more that the UI / PR review approach that you've taken is more ergonomic for solving them?reply",
      "hey! that's awesome to hear, thanks for the feedback.we've tried a lot of things to make code more in-line with our paradigms (initially tried a few agents to parse out \"project rules\" from existing code, then used that in the system prompt), but have found that the agents tend to go off-track regardless. the highest leverage has just been changing the model (Claude writes code a certain way which we tend to prefer, vs GPT, etc) and a few strong system prompts (NEVER WRITE COMMENTS, repeated twice).so the questions here are less about that, but more about overall functional / system requirements, and acknowledging that for stylistic things, the user will still have to review.reply",
      "Something I'd consider a game-changer would be making it really easy to kick off multiple claude instances to tackle a large researched task and then to view the results and collect them into a final research document.IME no matter how well I prompt, a single claude/codex will never get a successful implementation of a significant feature single-shot.
