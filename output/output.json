And be much more energy efficient.Oxide Computer, in one of their presentations, talks about using 80mm fans, as they are quiet and (more importantly) don't use much power.

      "I\u2019ve heard the exact opposite advice (keep the drives running to reduce wear from power cycling).Not sure what to believe, but I like having my ZFS NAS running so it can regularly run scrubs and check the data.

      ">Not sure what to believeKeep them running.Why?:* The read/write heads experience literally next to no wear while they are floating above the platters. They physically land onto shelves or onto landing zones on the platters themselves when turned off; landing and takeoff are by far the most wear the heads will suffer.* Following on the above, in the worst case the read/write heads might be torn off during takeoff due to stiction.* Bearings will last longer; they might also seize up if left stationary for too long. Likewise the drive motor.* The rush of current when turning on is an electrical stressor, no matter how minimal.The only reasons to turn your hard drives off are to save power, reduce noise, or transport them.\n \nreply",
      "Hard drives are often configured to spin down when idle for a certain time. This can cause many spinups and spindowns per day. So I don't buy this at all. But I don't have supporting evidence that back up this notion.\n \nreply",
      "There seems to be a huge difference between spin-down while NAS is up vs shutting the whole NAS down and restart. When I start my NAS, it takes a bunch of time to be back up: it seems to do a lot of checking on/ syncing off the drives and puts a fair amount of load on them (same is true for CPU as well, just look at your CPU load right after startup).OTOH, when the NAS spins up a single disk again, I haven't notice any additional load. Presumably, the read operation just waits until the disk is ready.\n \nreply",

You might think something's off and you'd be right. That's only about 250 days worth of runtime. And therein lies the secret of drive longevity (I think):Turn the server off when you're not using it.According to people on Hacker News I have my bearings wrong. The chance of having zero drive failures over 10 years for 24 drives is much higher than I thought it was. So this good result may not be related to turning my NAS off and keeping it off most off the time.My NAS is turned off by default. I only turn it on (remotely) when I need to use it.

      "I have being using Trial[1] for the past few weeks to test out game development in Common Lisp, and have been having a great time. Being able to alter (almost) all aspects of your game while it's running is a blessing.I hope this port succeeds.[1]: https://github.com/Shirakumo/trial\n \nreply",
      "Lisp languages seem well-suited for building games. The ability to evaluate code interactively without recompilation is a huge deal for feature building, incremental development, and bug-fixing. Retaining application state between code changes seems like it would be incredibly useful. Common Lisp also appears to be a much faster language than I would have blindly assumed.The main downside for me (in general, not just for game programming) is the clunkiness in using data structures - maps especially. But the tradeoff seems worth it.\n \nreply",
      "One of the downsides is that implementations like SBCL have a deep integration and need things like a well performing GC implementation - to get this running on specialized game hardware is challenging. The article describes that. Getting over the hurdle of the low-level integration is difficult. The reward comes, when one gets to the point, where  the rapid incremental development cycles of Common Lisp, even with connected devices, kicks in.For the old historic Naughty Dog use case, it was a development system written in Common Lisp on an SGI and a C++ runtime with low-level Scheme code on the Playstation.> Common Lisp also appears to be a much faster language than I would have blindly assumed.There are two modes:1) fast optimized code which allows for some low-level stuff to stay with Common Lisp2) unoptimized, but natively compiled code, which enables safe (-> the runtime does not crash) interactive and incremental development -> this mode is where much of the software can run nowadays and which is still \"fast enough\" for many use cases\n \nreply",
      "If that's your main downside, that's pretty good, since clunkiness is in many ways fixable. Personally with standard CL I like to use property lists with keywords, so a \"map literal\" is just (list :a 3 :b 'other). It's fine when the map is small. The getter is just getf, setting is the usual setf around the getter. There's a cute way to loop by #'cddr for a key-and-value loop, though Alexandria (a very common utility library) has some useful utils for looping/removing/converting plists as well.If typing out \"(list ...)\" is annoying, it's a few lines of code to let you type {:a 3 :b 4} instead, like Clojure. And the result of that can be a plist, or a hash table, or again like Clojure one of the handful of immutable map structures available. You can also easily make the native hash tables print themselves out with the curly bracket syntax.(On the speed front, you might be amused by https://renato.athaydes.com/posts/how-to-write-slow-rust-cod... But separately, when you want to speed up Lisp (with SBCL) even more than default, it's rather fun to be able to run disassemble on your function and see what it's doing at the assembly level, and turn up optimization hints and have the compiler start telling you (even on the individual function level) about where it has to use e.g. generic addition instead of a faster assembly instruction because it can't prove type info and you'll have to tell it/fix your code. It can tell you about dead code it removed. You can define stack-allocation if needed. Simple benchmarking that also includes processor cycles and memory allocated is available immediately with the built-in time macro...)\n \nreply",
      "> The ability to evaluate code interactively without recompilationSBCL and other implementations compile code to machine code then execute it. That is to say, when a form is submitted to the REPL, the form is not interpreted, but first compiled then executed. The reason execution finishes quickly is because compilation finishes quickly.There are some implementations, like CCL, with a special interpreter mode exclusively for REPL-usage.[1] However, at least SBCL and ECL will compile code, not interpret.[1] https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/blob/v1.13/level-1/l1-readloo...\n \nreply",

      "Lots of comments on this thread about bounty payouts. If a tech giant with a standing bounty program isn't paying a bounty, the odds are very strong that there's a good reason for that. All of the incentives for these programs are to award bounties to legitimate submissions. This is a rare case where incentives actually align pretty nicely: companies stand up bounty programs to incentivize specific kinds of research; not paying out legitimate bounties works against that goal. Nobody on the vendor side is spending their own money. The sums involved are not meaningful to the company. Generally, the team members running the program are actually incentivized to pay out more bounties, not less.\n \nreply",
      "No, it's because Apple's 'product security' team that investigates and pays out bug bounties is horribly mismanaged and ineffective. It was recently moved from the SWE program office to SEAR (security engineering & arch), and the manager was recently shown the door and went to AirBNB. The team members are mostly new college grads (ICT2's and 3's) who wouldn't pass a coding interview elsewhere in the company, and mostly function as bug triagers. They spend more time going to conferences and hanging out with hackers, than in front of a computer screen working. Their portal of 'open investigations' shows a graph that only goes up (aka they only get more swamped with emails and don't even try to catch up).Shaming Ivan, the head of SEAR, on Twitter is how people who should get paid bounties, but aren't, make progress.\n \nreply",
      "I have no idea about how well the bounty program at Apple is managed, so, without affirming this, I acknowledge this is another plausible explanation: it's just an understaffed team that needs to get its act together.The only crusade I'm on is against the idea that companies ruthlessly avoid paying bounties, which is, on information and belief, flatly false, like, the opposite of the truth. I think it's valuable for people to get an intuition for that.Thanks for this!\n \nreply",

      "Sure. My comment isn't really about Apple specifically so much as bounty program misconceptions generally.\n \nreply",
      "I think suspicion of bug bounties even from organizations who would clearly benefit the nost from doing them right are well founded and you are over simplifying the situation.Every organization includes a mess of situations where the overall best interest of the organization no longer comes through. Groups and individuals don't want to admit mistakes both personal and in wider senses and have alliances, competitions, team and organizational loyalty that twists their behavior.A lot of organizations know they would benefit from having a proper whistle blower program and then proceed to crucify the first person who uses it.\n \nreply",

I found the the basemaps look much better than the protomaps site makes them appear (they're super zoomed out in the samples where the styles don't come together as well as they do when zoomed in)\n \nreply",
      "Super neat, the end result looks great and adds a lot to the posts. On the downside, inlining the map causes the HTML to balloon up to ~500kB/~180kB gzipped, compared to 30kB/10kB on this post (which lacks a map). The site is already insanely fast, but you could pull the map SVG into an actual file, so it's cached between pages, and becomes a lower-priority resource (which will ~halve First Contentful Paint). Then you'd just position the circle on top of that generic map file!\n \nreply",
      "You could then also run it through SVGO to compress it further.\n \nreply",
      "Indeed - looks like SVGO can crush that map from 500kB down to like 80kB! Users on constrained data plans will love that. Of course, the author notes they want higher fidelity at some point. They could consider breaking the SVG into quadrants, perhaps? Or something more clever :)\n \nreply",
      "the author is also using many large, multi-megabyte photos in their travel posts, so I'm not sure how significant the size of the SVG content is, in comparison\n \nreply",
      "Big inlined resources impact paint time - a lot! You'll see this by running Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights on the posts. E.g. no map: https://imgur.com/a/5CJjEUq vs map: https://imgur.com/a/mX1ZDz7That means users are staring at blank for longer. That can really stink on a poor connection.Images are requested at a lower priority and so don't cause the same problems for rendering. But it's a great idea to compress them, too, and use something like `srcset` to send an appropriately sized version!\n \nreply",
      "Really impressive! I've implemented a few kinds of maps on my blog, and I fail all of their requirements:- I use a 3rd party platform- My maps are generated at runtime- They looks... let's say vaguely consistent on mobile & desktopMaps were the most painful and time-consuming part of building a travel blog, but also perhaps the most satisfying.\n \nreply",
      "Also if the author views this, would love an rss feed. Can use the github pretty easily but maybe commits have updates, not new blog posts\n \nreply",
      "what a great looking website.love the craft. now I need to set aside some time to read the post\u2026 !\n \nreply",

I enjoy doing this a) because it's a nice memento of how I approached and solved a problem I set for myself, and b) I hate to horde knowledge and on the off chance someone wants to add svg maps to their personal website, maybe this will help them navigate the process.Two main reasons, both of them more personal and emotional than logical. First, I like maps and I miss working with them! All of the best jobs I've had in my adult life revolved around working with maps on a regular basis. As a research assistant in grad school, I was lucky to work for an old school Geography Professor who would have me plot historical data on maps by hand. As a Software Engineer, I managed to end up working on a small corner of the Mapbox platform for a few years. Long workdays are much more enjoyable when you are working on something t"

      "5400rpm laptop hard drives were notoriously sensitive to external force because of their thin metal construction and low power motor.I remember having a MacBook Pro with a Toshiba 5400rpm hard drive that failed shortly after I rested it on an HVAC  unit in our server closet (the HVAC unit happened to be the perfect height off the floor for doing work while standing). Just to be sure that was the cause, I had the drive replaced under warranty, did the same thing again and it died again after only a short while of using it on that HVAC unit.After Apple replaced the drive a second time, I instead used a crash cart as a laptop desk and put a sign on the HVAC unit that read \"Don't put laptops on here.\"\n \nreply",
      "> \"Don't put laptops on here.\"With an explanation why not? I feel like having that, instead of a \"Here Be Dragons\" note would be more helpful, so someone won't ignore the sign thinking \"It'll be fine\".Also it'd be funny if the sign is still there even though all* laptops have SSDs now...\n \nreply",

      "Not hard drive related AFAIK, but I used to work in a media lab with about 30 mac desktops of around the powermac g4 vintage.We noticed that the macs were rebooting unexpectedly when certain people were in the room. After a bit of observation we worked out that the call button on our walkie talkies could trigger a reboot from a couple of feet away, which turned out to be an awesome superpower if you'd had a gobful from an especially obnoxious student.\n \nreply",

(There will always be more \"unfortunate physics\", for example I bet that the hard disk also fails if I smash it against a wall at 100mph, but nobody's going do care designing a consumer HD that stops exhibiting that specific behavior.)\n \nreply",
      "There's more physics issues with the speakers themselves; especially for something like a laptop speaker in a small enclosed space, it's totally possible to blow it out by turning the volume up too high.There are various ways to protect against this, easiest being to just limit the top volume.

Not an artistic judgement.One discovery during the investigation is that playing the music video also crashed some of their competitors\u2019 laptops.And then they discovered something extremely weird: Playing the music video on one laptop caused a laptop sitting nearby to crash, even though that other laptop wasn\u2019t playing the video!What\u2019s going on?It turns out that the song contained one of the natural resonant frequencies for the model of 5400 rpm laptop hard drives that they and other manufacturers used.The manufacturer worked around the problem by adding a custom filter in the audio pipeline that detected and removed the offending frequencies during audio playback.And I\u2019m su"

So we put it to test using the same baseline testing harness we've used to assess Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini 1.5. Here are the results:Is o1 a new paradigm towards AGI? Will it scale up? What explains the massive difference between o1's performance on IOI, AIME, and many other impressive benchmark scores compared to only modest scores on ARC-AGI?There's a lot to talk about.o1 fully realizes the \"let's think step by step\" chain-of-thought (CoT) paradigm by applying it at both training time and test time inference.In practice, o1 is significantly less likely to make mistakes when performing tasks where the sequence of intermediate steps is well-represented in the synthetic CoT traini"
