      "Am I reading this correctly that the address where they found the child was where her mother\u2019s boyfriend was living?> \"So we narrowed it down to [this] one address\u2026 and started the process of confirming who was living there through state records, driver's licence\u2026 information on schools,\" says Squire.> The team realised that in the household with Lucy was her mother's boyfriend - a convicted sex offender.There\u2019s a lot of focus on Facebook in the comments here, but unless I\u2019m missing something the strangest part about this story was that the child\u2019s mother was dating a convicted sex offender and they had to go through all of this process to arrive at this? It\u2019s impressive detective work with the brick expert identifying bricks and the sofa sellers gathering their customer list, but how did this connection not register earlier?reply",

      "That would make sense. Thank you.reply",
      "Exactly, it sounds like they didn't know who the girl was from photos alone; \"Lucy\" was just a name they gave the victim.reply",
      "> They contacted Facebook, which at the time dominated the social media landscape, asking for help scouring uploaded family photos - to see if Lucy was in any of them. But Facebook, despite having facial recognition technology, said it \"did not have the tools\" to help.Willing to bet my life savings that they are able to do exactly this when the goal is to create shadow profiles or maximize some metric.reply",
      "Facial recognition is very powerful these days. My friend took a photo of his kid at the top of Twin Peaks in SF, with the city in the background. Unfortunately, due to the angle, you could barely see the eyes and a portion of the nose of the kid. Android was still able to tag the kid.I feel like Facebook really dropped the ball here. It is obvious that Squire and colleagues are working for the Law Enforcement. If FB was concerned about privacy, they could have asked them to get a judicial warrant to perform a broad search.But they didn't. And Lucy continued to be abused for months after that.I hope when Zuck is lying on his death bed, he gets to think about these choices that he has made.reply",
      "> I feel like Facebook really dropped the ball hereFacebook/Meta only began rolling out DeepFace [0] in 2015 [1]Squire mentioned in the article that this case was early in his career and that Lucy is now in her 20s but was abused when she was 10-12.This means this case was probably around 2010-14 when facial recognition was not yet a solved problem.Heck, VGG-Face wasn't released until 2015 [2] and Image-Based Crowd Counting only began becoming solvable in 2015-16.> Facial recognition is very powerful these days.Yes.

      "Facebook rightly retired their facial recognition system in 2021 over concerns about user privacy. Facebook is a social media site, they are not the government or police.reply",
      "When people on hacker News talk about requiring cops to do traditional police work instead of doing wide ranging trawls using technology, this is exactly what they meant. I hope you don't complain when the future you want becomes reality and the three letter agencies come knocking down your door just because you happened to be in the same building as a crime in progress and the machine learning algorithms determined your location via cellular logs and labelled you as a criminal.reply",
      "> From that list of 40 or 50 people, it was easy to find and trawl their social media.

It was impossible to work out who, or where, Lucy was.What he was soon to discover was that the clue to the 12-year-old's location was hidden in plain sight.Squire works for US Department of Homeland Security Investigations in an elite unit which attempts to identify children appearing in sexual abuse material.A BBC World Service team has spent five years filming with Squire, and other investigative units in Portugal, Brazil, and Russia - showing them solving cases such as that"

      "\"Self-Generated Skills: No Skills provided, but the agent is prompted to generate relevant procedural knowledge before solving the task. This isolates the impact of LLMs\u2019 latent domain knowledge\"This is a useful result, but it is important to note that this is not necessarily what people have in mind when they think of \"LLMs generating skills.\" Having the LLM write down a skill representing the lessons from the struggle you just had to get something done is more typical (I hope) and quite different from what they're referring to.I'm sure news outlets and popular social media accounts will use appropriate caution in reporting this, and nobody will misunderstand it.reply",
      "It's even worse than this: the \"tasks\" that are evaluated are limited to a single markdown file of instructions, plus an opaque verifier (page 13-14). No problems involving existing codebases, refactors, or anything of the like, where the key constraint is that the \"problem definition\" in the broadest sense doesn't fit in context.So when we look at the prompt they gave to have the agent generate its own skills:> Important: Generate Skills First\nBefore attempting to solve this task, please follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the task requirements and identify what domain knowledge, APIs, or techniques are needed.\n2. Write 1\u20135 modular skill documents that would help solve this task. Each skill should: focus on a specific tool, library,\nAPI, or technique; include installation/setup instructions if applicable; provide code examples and usage patterns; be\nreusable for similar tasks.\n3. Save each skill as a markdown file in the environment/skills/ directory with a descriptive name.\n4. Then solve the task using the skills you created as reference.There's literally nothing it can do by way of \"exploration\" to populate and distill self-generated skills - not with a web search, not exploring an existing codebase for best practices and key files - only within its own hallucinations around the task description.It also seems they're not even restarting the session after skills are generated, from that fourth bullet? So it's just regurgitating the context that was used to generate the skills.So yeah, your empty-codebase vibe coding agent can't just \"plan harder\" and make itself better. But this is a misleading result for any other context, including the context where you ask for a second feature on that just-vibe-coded codebase with a fresh session.reply",
      "I don't see how \"create an abstraction before attempting to solve the problem\" will ever work as a decent prompt when you are not even steering it towards specifics.If you gave this exact prompt to a senior engineer I would expect them to throw it back and ask wtf you actually want.LLMs are not mind readers.reply",
      "If I already know the problem space very well, we can tailor a skill that will help solve the problem exactly how I already know I want it to be solved.reply",
      "Thats actually super interesting and why I really don\u2019t like the whole .md folder structures or even any CLAUDE.md. It just seems most of the time you really just want to give it what it needs for best results.The headline is really bullshit, yes, I like the testing tho.reply",
      "CLAUDE.md in my projects only has coding / architecture guidelines. Here's what not to do. Here's what you should do. Here are my preferences. Here's where the important things are.Even though my CLAUDE.md is small though, often my rules are ignored. Not always though, so it's still at least somewhat useful!reply",
      "The point of so-called 'skills' is to be short how-to reminders that the agent can pull into its context and then act upon.  If the knowledge is already in the model, it will most likely be surfaced in reasoning phase anyway, so there's little benefit to writing it up as a skill, unless perhaps it's extremely relevant and hard to surface, and you want the model to skip that part of the reasoning.reply",
      "I've been building a skill to help run manual tests on an app. So I go through and interactively steer toward a useful validation of a particular PR, navigating specifics of the app and what I care about and what I don't. Then in the end I have it build a skill that would have skipped backtracking and retries and the steering I did.Then I do it again from scratch; this time it takes less steering. I have it update the skill further.I've been doing this on a few different tests and building a skill which is taking less and steering to do app-specific and team-specific manual testing faster and faster. The first times through it took longer than manually testing the feature. While I've only started doing this recently, it is now taking less time than I would take, and posting screenshots of the results and testing steps in the PR for dev review. Ongoing exploration!reply",
      "There is a benefit of a skill though. If an AI keeps encoding common tasks as skills and scripts, the LLM eventually just becomes a dumb routing mechanism for ambiguous user requests, which ultimately drives down token usage.If everything you want an LLM do is already captured as code or simple skills, you can switch to dumber models which know enough about selecting the appropriate skill for a given user input, and not much else. You would only have to tap into more expensive heavy duty LLMs when you are trying to do something that hasn\u2019t been done before.Naturally, AI companies with vested interest in making sure you use as many tokens as possible will do everything they can to steer you away from this type of architecture. It\u2019s a cache for LLM reasoning.reply",
      "AI companies don't want you to waste tokens, they benefit when you use them efficiently because they can serve more users on the infra that's the main bottleneck for them. It's Jevons' paradox in action.reply"

I know more now, which often more than makes up for slower learning, but I can\u2019t learn difficult novel subjects in depth as fast as I once did.I\u2019m glad I learned OS in depth during high school via Gentoo linux. And engineering/physics/math in college. It\u2019s very easy to assimilate any new knowledge which can be understood through those areas of first principles.But learning more advanced math is quite a task now.reply",
      "Can you really say that unless you switched fields multiple times? Of course you'll pick up on math and physics faster in high school than in college or postgrad, but that's because the problems get way, way harder as you progress. I've found that even in my late 30s I can still easily pick up new skills outside my field of expertise as long as I start with the basics that could also be picked up by a high-schooler. I started learning a new language last year and thanks to modern study apps, I actually find it easier today. Of course it will still take a long time to become an expert, but I'm not sure it would need more total hours than if I had started 20 years ago. It just gets more difficult to allocate the necessary hours for learning.reply",
      "> Can you really say that unless you switched fields multiple times?I have ;-) far too many times! Even going back and taking undergrad math coursework that my engineering curriculum didn't have like Discrete Math or Statistics got a lot harder than calculus / differential equations was when I was younger. I felt like I got less out of each hour, and also couldn't put in as many hours - not just because I have more responsibilities, but also because my brain just gets tired after fewer hours.reply",

What I mean is that there is a lot of complexities or stuff i would get stuck upon that I just fly over today and know I'm alright - much better ability to focus in a sensereply",

      "I feel like we are talking past each other.1. I write hobby code all the time. I've basically stopped writing these by hand and now use an LLM for most of these tasks. I don't think anyone is opposed to it. I had zero users before and I still have zero users. And that is ok.2. There are actual free and open source projects that I use. Sometimes I find a paper cut or something that I think could be done better. I usually have no clue where to begin. I am not sure if it even is a defect most of the time. Could it be intentional? I don't know. Best I can do is reach out and ask. This is where the friction begins. Nobody bangs out perfect code on first attempt but usually maintainers are kind to newcomers because who knows maybe one of those newcomers could become one of the maintainers one day. \"Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.\"LLM changed that. The newcomers are more like Linguini than Remy. What's the point in mentoring someone who doesn't read what you write and merely feeds it into a text box for a next token predictor to do the work. To continue the analogy from the Disney Pixar movie Ratatouille, we need enthusiastic contributors like Remy, who want to learn how things work and care about the details. Most people are not like that. There is too much going on every day and it is simply not possible to go in depth about everything. We must pick our battles.I almost forgot what I was trying to say. The bottom line is, if you are doing your own thing like I am, LLM is great. However, I would request everyone to have empathy and not spread our diarrhea into other people's kitchens.If it wasn't an LLM, you wouldn't simply open a pull request without checking first with the maintainers, right?reply",

Social media destroyed it.AI is killing creativity and human collaboration, long nights spent having pizza and coffee debugging that stubborn issue or implementing yet another 3D engine\u2026 now it is all extremely boring.reply",
      "Reviewing code was also a big bottleneck. With lot more untested code where authors don't care about reviewing their own code it will take even more toll on open source maintainers. Code quality between side projects and open source projects are different. Ensuring good code quality enables long term maintenance for open source projects that have to support the feature through the years as a compatibility promise.reply",

      "Isn\u2019t it also destroying the internet with low-quality content and affecting content creation in general? Can LLMs still rely on data from the open internet for training?reply",
      "The Economics of content platforms already started destroying the internet.  A lot of the reason the internet was so good for a long time was faith by creators that good content would win, that turned out to be false.reply",

      "Really nice introduction. Two things stood out to me that I think set this apart from the dozens of \"intro to PyTorch\" posts out there:1. The histogram visualization of the different tensor initialization functions is a great idea. I've seen so many beginners confused about rand vs randn vs empty, and seeing the distributions side by side makes the differences immediately obvious. More tutorials should lead with \"the best way to understand is to see it.\"2. I appreciate that the article is honest about its own results. A lot of intro tutorials quietly pick a dataset where their simple model gets impressive numbers. Here the model gets 18.6% MAPE and only 37% of predictions within 10% \u2014 and instead of hand-waving, the author correctly diagnoses the issue: the features don't capture location granularity, and no amount of architecture tuning will fix missing information. That's arguably the most important ML lesson in the whole piece, and it's buried at the end almost as an afterthought. \"Great models can't compensate for missing information\" is something I wish more practitioners internalized early.The suggestion to reach for XGBoost/LightGBM for tabular data is also good advice that too many deep learning tutorials omit. Would love to see a follow-up comparing the two approaches on this same dataset.reply",
      "Thank you so much. Really appreciate the thoughtful feedback!I've watched many intros. Somehow they always end with 90%+ accuracy and that was just not my experience while learning on datasets I picked myself. I remember spending hours tuning different parameters and not quite understanding why I was getting way worse accuracy. I showed this intentionally, and I'm glad you commented on this!The XGBoost comparison is a great idea.reply",

Starting with basic mesh rendering before jumping into differentiable rendering made the concepts click. The voxel-to-mesh conversion examples were particularly clear.If anything, I'd love to see a follow-up covering point cloud handling, since that seems to be a major use case based on the docs I'm now digging through.Thanks for writing this \u2014 triggered a weekend deep-dive I probably wouldn't have started otherwise.reply",

      "One pattern I've found useful alongside this: Postgres advisory locks (pg_advisory_xact_lock) for cases where the contention isn't row-level but logic-level. For example, if two requests try to create the \"first\" resource of a type - there's no existing row to SELECT FOR UPDATE against.Advisory locks let you serialize on an arbitrary key (like a hash of the entity type + parent ID) without needing a dummy row or separate lock table. They auto-release on transaction end, so no cleanup.The barrier testing approach from the article would work nicely here too - inject the barrier between acquiring the advisory lock and the subsequent insert, then verify the second transaction blocks until the first commits.reply",

My hunch is the test middleware layer can intercept calls and impose a deterministic ordering.(There are a few papers around looking into more complex OS level frameworks to systematically search for concurrency bugs, but these would be tough to drop into the average web app.)reply",

      "Postgres has SERIALIZABLE transaction isolation level. Just use it and then you never have to worry about any of these race conditions.And if for some reason you refuse to, then this \"barrier\" or \"hooks\" approach to testing will in practice not help. It requires you to already know the potential race conditions, but if you are already aware of them then you will already write your code to avoid them. It is the non-obvious race conditions that should scare you.To find these, you should use randomized testing that runs many iterations of different interleavings of transaction steps. You can build such a framework that will hook directly into your individual DB query calls. Then you don't have to add any \"hooks\" at all.But even that won't find all race condition bugs, because it is possible to have race conditions surface even within a single database query.You really should just use SERIALIZABLE and save yourself all the hassle and effort and spending hours writing all these tests.reply",
      "Not a silver bullet. When you use serializable you have more opportunities for deadlocks (cases which would otherwise be logic errors at weaker isolation levels).Serializable just means that within the transaction your logic can naively assume it\u2019s single threaded. It doesn\u2019t magically solve distributed system design for you.reply",
      "Good call, SERIALIZABLE is a strong option - it eliminates a whole class of bugs at the isolation level. The trade-off is your app needs to handle serialization failures with retry logic, which introduces its own complexity. That retry logic itself needs testing, and barriers work for that too.\nOn randomized testing - that actually has the same limitation you mentioned about barriers: you need to know where to point it. And without coordination, the odds of two operations overlapping at exactly the wrong moment are slim. You'd need enormous pressure to trigger the race reliably, and even then a passing run doesn't prove much. Barriers make the interleaving deterministic so a pass actually means something.reply"

I think some form of square root normalization over total users is probably the best balance.reply",

We expose those annotations in a SQL interface. It's an alternative/complementary approach to embeddings/LLMs for working with text data.

      "The thing I would appreciate much more than performance in \"embarrassing LLM questions\" is a method of finding these, and figuring out by some form of statistical sampling, what the cardinality is of those for each LLM.It's difficult to do because LLMs immediately consume all available corpus, so there is no telling if the algorithm improved, or if it just wrote one more post-it note and stuck it on its monitor. This is an agency vs replay problem.Preventing replay attacks in data processing is simple: encrypt, use a one time pad, similarly to TLS. How can one make problems which are at the same time natural-language, but where at the same time the contents, still explained in plain English, are \"encrypted\" such that every time an LLM reads them, they are novel to the LLM?Perhaps a generative language model could help. Not a large language model, but something that understands grammar enough to create problems that LLMs will be able to solve - and where the actual encoding of the puzzle is generative, kind of like a random string of balanced left and right parentheses can be used to encode a computer program.Maybe it would make sense to use a program generator that generates a random program in a simple, sandboxed language - say, I don't know, LUA - and then translates that to plain English for the LLM, and asks it what the outcome should be, and then compares it with the LUA program, which can be quickly executed for comparison.Either way we are dealing with an \"information war\" scenario, which reminds me of the relevant passages in Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age about faking statistical distributions by moving units to weird locations in Africa. Maybe there's something there.I'm sure I'm missing something here, so please let me know if so.reply",

I read a paper the other day that mentioned advanced reasoning (like MoE) is currently >10x - 75x more computationally expensive. LLM vendors aren't subsidizing model costs as much as they were so, I assume SotA cloud models are always attempting some optimizations unless the user forces it.I think these one sentence 'LLM trick questions' may increasingly be testing optimization pre-processors more than the full extent of SotA model's max capability.reply"

I wouldn't believe this without proofs other than introspection(1). Technically, the vagus nerve can carry enough information to produce speech (the gut should be articulate, of course), but it certainly nowhere near the corpus callosum or the spinal cord. I doubt that it can allow to \"coordinate the rest of our body\".(1) As far as know conscious manipulation of the heart rate is achieved by changing respiratory patterns, not thru direct control of the signals that the brain sends there.reply",

In contrast, the data on the hard drives or the TPM might be hard or impossible to restore.In the same way, I'd still see the brain as the center of the self, because so much cognitive information is stored there.reply",

For example this one: https://jmail.world/thread/55b91b46ef1e4487bee131a8505e14a4?...For that example, the first problem is that there is no link to the source file from the disclosed files, which is strange, because most other emails have that. Secondly, this almost seems to be a \"sponsored\" email or something, as it has an ad in the top right corner reading \"Sponsored by Drop Site News\", but clicking that just takes you to some general page, with no clear information how that's related to the fake/injected email. Also, what does \"Verified by X\" actually mean, did they verify the authenticity of that specific email?There seems to be a bunch of people confused by those emails and wondering where they are coming from, because it's missing the source link like the others, so there doesn't seem to be a good way to verify those emails.
