It\u2019s like Claude Code vs. Claude Cowork. They\u2019re the same thing. But given the low cost of creating custom tools, why not give people something that Clawd.bot that gives them focused guardrails?Anyway, I could end up abandoning all of this too.

      "You know I\u2019ve never read an article by Gwern that made me feel like he was sensitive to this idea, one that in my head essentially breaks down to the use of narrative and the leverage of \u201cstakes\u201d that inform the reader of kinds of conflict that make a narrative special.I\u2019m reminded of a remark made by David Foster Wallace (on KCRW? Or oft-repeated elsewhere) about how he had to come to terms with the purpose of writing not being to show off how smart you are to the reader. Instead your writing has to evince some kind of innate investment to the reader that piques their genuine interests and intrigue.A lot of writers are tainted by the expectations set in grade school. Write for a grade and good writing is what yields a good grade according to the standards set by the subject which often is not \u2018Composition\u2019 but more like \u2018Prove to me that you remember everything we mentioned in class about the French Revolution\u2019.I\u2019ve never felt drawn into an article by Gwern at least not in the way that I have been by some writing by Maciej Ceg\u0142owski, for example. Reading Gwern I am both overwhelmed by the adornments to the text (hyperlinks, pop-ups, margin notes; other hypertext doodads and portals) and underwhelmed by the substance of the text itself. I don\u2019t consider Paul Graham a literary griot either. But I find that his own prose is bolstered by a kind of clarity and asceticism that is informative and not entirely void of good style and form.Lawrence McEnery of the University of the Chicago contributed a lot of good thinking to this kind of stuff though.This wasn\u2019t meant to be a criticism of the author of this post\u2019s own work. But here that\u2019s how it\u2019s left. I haven\u2019t come across any writing of his that\u2019s as intriguing as \"Empires Without Farms: The Case of Venice\u201d seems. If anyone has any recommendations, do share.reply",
      "I think for a lot of people, simply having \"Author: Gwern\" (or some other author they like) is the sufficient bit of information to make them care, it's generic on the content. I've read a lot of not very stylish writing simply because of who wrote it. Or in other words, \"Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.\" Whatever quirks of bad style there are will get a pass because I already care -- style is more important when you want to reach someone who hasn't heard of you.reply",
      "Yeah, but even that isn't going to make me care about why Gwern is obsessing over Venice.  Part of that is that I follow Overly Sarcastic Productions on youtube and \"Blue\" did a vastly better job of expressing/performing \"I'm excited about Venice, and in a couple of minutes you will be too!\" - an advantage of the medium and of their chosen style, for reaching someone like me who isn't all that compelled by European history.(Yes, I get that it was an example to make a point about a writing style; one of the risks of really concrete examples is bouncing off of the example itself :-)reply",
      "I like where you\u2019re heading with this and to a degree I think that it leads toward considerations about the personality of the author in tow with their writing and writing ability which on its head evokes questions about what makes a person, well, personable. Which turns this into a sensitive discussion about what one can glean about an author\u2019s character traits based on their writing style and when the author in question is only a \u2018public figure\u2019 in the eyes of the niche collection of online enclaves who are even aware that Gwern exists it becomes tough to candidly critique his literary persona with the sort of freedom that one may have when talking about say, some guy who\u2019s written for the Atlantic for 30 years and is further from the spaces where criticisms about his work are held.My criticisms about Gwern\u2019s writing is not meant to be taken...ahem...personally in the sense that I don\u2019t want to use Gwern as a subject for whatever literary critique I\u2019m trying to proffer beyond how useful it is\u2014and is presenting itself\u2014as a fine case to help make whatever point I\u2019m trying to make more clear about how Writing style is inextricable from and indicative of personality or lack thereof. And this is probably a part of what makes reading and writing such a profound experience.One of the most interesting remarks about Gwern\u2019s writing is this comment [1]:> Everything I read from gwern has this misanthropic undertones. It's hard to put a finger on it exactly, but it grits me when I try reading him.\u2014 <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42135302>While I can't agree with the entirety of `mola\u2019s comment\u2014I simply haven\u2019t put that much thought into making as grave of an evaluation into Gwern\u2019s character as such a judgement would demand, nor am I that interested in deliberating over such an evaluation\u2014it still resonates with me as a reader and you\u2019ll find in my comment downthread from `mola\u2019s remark that it\u2019s at least plausible that an affinity for self-expression and intellectualizing about the world doesn\u2019t necessitate an interest in the rest of its inhabitants in a way that causes me not to find the thesis behind \u201cFirst, make me care\u201d to be coloured with a stroke of irony, considering who\u2019s behind it.You say \"style is more important when you want to reach someone who hasn't heard of you.\u201d I agree with that and I reckon that it\u2019s still style that forms a non-trivial amount of how you identify with \u2018who\u2019 the author is once you\u2019ve become familiar with they\u2019re work and can set an expectation for why their ideas may be worthwhile to engage with in the first place. Again, Paul Graham\u2019s writing has a style although no where to the degree that Maciej Ceg\u0142owski does. You can evince characteristics about each of them relative to how and what they write about. You can even speculate on ways that their respective personalities could lead to friction between them. [2]When we interrogate the \u201cwho\u201d behind \u201cwho wrote\u201d we are making judgements about the personality of the author and how that that makes us interested in their ideas. Today there are various non-literary mediums that give us a glimpse at a person\u2019s personality with which we can anticipate whether it\u2019s worth reading what they write. But if all you go by is their writing then how they write is about the only way for you to speculate about 'who' the author is and what they\u2019re like as a person.There are probably holes in this line of reasoning but I don\u2019t think the lines between writing style, personal appeal and the ability to appeal to readers through how you write\u2014effectively signaling to your personality in the process!\u2014are as distinct as I think you\u2019re portraying them. What\u2019s the opposite of orthogonal? Correlated?To end: Gwern\u2019s writing lacks personality to me. This makes it hard to reconcile with the point he\u2019s making in this article (which I agree with!) and my perception of his own writing (which invariably and perhaps even unfortunately invites speculation into any writer\u2019s own personality).Again, please, Does Gwern have anything that sounds as striking as \u201cEmpires Without Farms: The Case of Venice\u201d or was that example a tacit hat tip to Brett Devereaux\u2019s work? I don\u2019t think the guy is a misanthrope but I do sense a wall of text\u2014both figuratively and literally\u2014between he and I when engaging with his writing. He is evidently well and widely read and despite my dislike for the visual form of his website I think that it is still a solid technical display of hypertext for personal web design and information architecture. But in spite of this all I find that it lacks depth, not intellectually but personally. \u2019Spiritually\u2019, if you will.[1] Now you may be able figure out my reasoning for the first paragraph re: public figures and criticism. I guess that\u2019s this puts me in the camp of those who don\u2019t believe that\u2019s possible to separate art from the artist. Discussing one commands a look into the other, otherwise why bother with \u2018art\u2019 and \u2018artists\u2019 at all?[2] Those who are familiar with both Graham\u2019s and Ceg\u0142owski\u2019s writing can take a guess at who once called the other a \u201cbig ole weenis\u201d in an exchange on this very site.reply",
      ">David Foster Wallace (on KCRW? Or oft-repeated elsewhere) about how he had to come to terms with the purpose of writing not being to show off how smart you are to the reader.He expands on this in his conversation with Bryan Garner (of Garner's Modern English Grammar) published as Quack this Way, and I think he gets to the core issue, which is that your ideas are not interesting to anyone but you; if you are showing off how smart you are, you are assuming the reader will find your ideas as important and interesting as you do. It is the writer's job to show the reader why they should be interested, why they should care.Infinite Jest is a also a good example of something which goes against TFA's point, it opens with a very sterile, impersonal, literal and completely disconnected first person narrative, he gives us nothing to care about. But it evolves, but he still doesn't give us anything to care about, just has the narration turn in on itself despite it seeming to have nothing to turn in onto. All he really gives us is the suggestion that there is something more than what we can see. He gets us interested and curious but I don't think we really care at that point.reply",
      "Besides the quote, which I think is a good practice, having never read his stuff, he seems like he publishes his notes directly from his note taking app.That's fine if you want to publish ideas in short form, but I don't think any of that is considered a piece of work that has been fully fleshed out. I don't really see any stuff that's designed to actually be a publication.reply",
      "It\u2019s a good quote from DFW but like all great useful pithy quotations it\u2019s usually negated somehow by the activities of the utterer elsewhere. It seemed almost granted that one of the metaconcepts within Infinite Jest was that his ability to churn out reams of that stuff was far in excess of your ability to even read through it.reply",
      "I feel the same. I found that blog from SSC/ACX and I still much prefer SSC/ACX despite gwern discussing topics that are much much more relevant to my interests (sw dev, Haskell, anime). I can't formulate why but your analysis sounds close enough.reply",
      "I agree, the citations having the little icons were distracting and I had to force myself not to skim. Still though, it's a very illuminating article that applies the very simple concept we all learned in theory to hook the reader but never really seen explicit examples of. I also found the similar pages feature interesting!reply",
      "Gwern's point stands on its own merits regardless of what you think of the rest of their blog. And the evidence is overwhelmingly the other way: Lots of people, and especially lots on HN, are very engaged with Gwern's writing, so Gwern seems to be onto something about how to engage readers. What do you think that is?That would be valuable analysis. Or provide constructive feedback. The complaints aren't constructive and don't inform us about the OP. To me they seem pointless and in the wrong spirit, especially when someone is in the room, within earshot.Edit: removed an error in what I said originally, sorry.reply"

      "The threading story here is what grabbed my attention. Pass-by-value with copy-on-write means you get data-race immunity without any locks or channels. You just pass data to a thread and mutations stay local. That's a genuinely useful property.I've worked on systems where we spent more time reasoning about shared state than writing actual logic. The typical answer is \"just make everything immutable\" but then you lose convenient imperative syntax. This sits in an interesting middle ground.Curious about performance in practice. Copy-on-write is great until you hit a hot path that triggers lots of copies. Have you benchmarked any real workloads?reply",
      "I have implemented similar behavior in some of my projects. For one, I also have also implemented 'cursors' that point to some part of a value bound to a variable and allow you to change that part of the value of the variable. I have used this to implement program transformations on abstract parse (syntax) trees [1]. I also have implemented a dictionary based on a tree where only part of the tree is modified that needs to be modified [2]. I have also started working on a language that is based on this, but also attempts to add references with defined behavior [3].[1] https://github.com/FransFaase/IParse/?tab=readme-ov-file#mar...[2] https://www.iwriteiam.nl/D1801.html#7[3] https://github.com/FransFaase/DataLangreply",

See Plotkin's classic work on PCF (~ 1975) for instance; Winskel's semantics text (~ 1990) is more approachable.Things of course become a lot more fun with concurrency.Now if you want a language where all the data thingies are immutable values and effects are somewhat tamed but types aren't too fancy etc. try looking at Milner's classic Standard ML (late 1970s, effectively frozen in 1997).

(If we assume that the argument and the result of a function call is a value, then this would mean higher order functions are impossible, for example.) If not that, then what?

It had only two fundamental types. (1) The atom: a possibly floating point number, and (2) the sequence: a list of zero or more atoms and sequences. Strings in particular are just sequences of codepoint atoms.It had a notion of \"type\"s which were functions that returned a boolean 1 only if given a valid value for the type being defined.

      "> Whenever I see another supposedly menial device including enough general purpose hardwareThe PineBuds are designed and sold as an open firmware platform to allow software experimentation, so there\u2019s nothing bad nor any economic failures going on here. Having a powerful general purpose microcontroller to experiment with is a design goal of the product.That said, ANC Bluetooth earbuds are not menial products. Doing ANC properly is very complicated. It\u2019s much harder than taking the input from a microphone, inverting the signal, and feeding it into the output. There\u2019s a lot of computation that needs to be done continuously.Using a powerful microcontroller isn\u2019t a failure, it\u2019s a benefit of having advanced semiconductor processes. Basically anything small and power efficient on a modern process will have no problem running at tens of MHz speeds. You want modern processes for the battery efficiency and you get speed as a bonus.The speed isn\u2019t wasted, either. Higher clock speeds means lower latency. In a battery powered device having an MCU running at 48MHz may seem excessive until you realize that the faster it finishes every unit of work the sooner it can go to sleep. It\u2019s not always about raw power.Modern earbuds are complicated. Having a general purpose MCU to allow software updates is much better than trying to get the entire wireless stack, noise cancellation, and everything else completely perfect before spinning out a custom ASIC.We\u2019re very fortunate to have all of this at our disposal. The groveling about putting powerful microcontrollers into small things ignores the reality of how hard it is to make a bug-free custom ASIC and break even on it relative to spending $0.10 per unit on a proven microcontroller manufacturer at scale.reply",

See eg https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2025/07/erica-chenoweth-demo...One current example of messaging can be seen in the reflexive dismissal  by the current US government and its propagandists of any popular opposition as 'paid protesters'. Large attendance at Democratic political rallies during the 2024 election was dismissed as being paid for by the campaign, any crowd protesting government policy is described as either a rioting or alleged to be financed by George Soros or some other boogeyman of the right.

Wait\u2026 Wait\u2026 Wait\u2026Compiling code usually means waiting, but Turbopack makes iteration loops fast with caching and incremental computation. Not every modern bundler uses an incremental approach, and that\u2019s with good reason. Incremental computation can introduce significant complexity and opportunities for bugs. Caches require extra tracking and copies of data, adding both CPU and memory overhead. When applied poorly, caching can actually make performance worse.Despite all of this, we took on these challenges because we knew that an incremental architecture would be critical to Turbopack\u2019s success. Turbopack is the new default bundler for Next.js, a framework that is used to build some of the largest web applications in the world. We needed to enable instant builds and a fast as-you-type interactive React Fast Refresh experience, even for the largest and most challenging workloads. Our incremental architecture is core to achieving this.Turbop"
