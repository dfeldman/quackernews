      "Anyone care to share their experiences with some of the less common Jellyfin frontends? Which ones are most in need of contributions?I've had a decent experience with the Samsung TV (Tizen) client. It's annoying to not have it on the app store yet and to jump through the developer-mode hoops to get it installed, but to be fair it was a one time setup and I've been happy with it since then. Seen some occasional slightly janky menu navigation, but really it's been far better than I expected.\n \nreply",
      "Lot's of criticism on here, but I love Jellyfin.I came from Plex a few years ago after their login server had an outage and I was unable to access the media that was on my local computer. Before that I'd been annoyed by them pushing TV shows and since then I've heard about them giving reports on what people have watched. All in all I'm happy.My setup is Jellyfin in a docker container running on a debian machine with an i7-1165G7. It's got a mounted NFS link to my Synology NAS with all the files. The main client I used is Android TV running on an NVIDIA shield.All in all, it's been great. I've got a few nitpicks---loading on ios app isn't as fast as I like if I try to jump to the middle of a movie---but all in all it's great for just watching movies, tv shows, videos, &c. All without any link to the outside world. It's lovely.They also are producing new features at a nice clip and have a strong community. I expect it to keep getting better and better, but honestly even if it never changed I'd happily use it for years.\n \nreply",
      "I love jellyfin but their web model is just bizarre.Why on earth, when you go to 192.168.whatever:8096 does it ask you what server you want to connect to? Like.. THE ONE SERVING THE PAGE.Just now I decided to connect to Jellyfin over tailscale and it's asking me to add a server; on 100.xxx, which is the jellyfin server which served the UI. And it doesn't seem to want to accept any answer as to what the server URL is.\n \nreply",
      "While the most common jellyfin distribution bundles the server and web UI together, the web UI (jellyfin-web) is a separate project from the server (jellyfin) and can be used to connect to multiple backends (which can run on the same or different hosts), which is why that functionality and UI is there. For what its worth, the web client should be autodetecting the server it was bundled with and using it without asking you each time. The only time it didn't do that for me was when my network was misconfigured and some requests were getting swallowed, which confused the client and caused it to fall back to the server-connection UI.\n \nreply",
      "> Why on earth, when you go to 192.168.whatever:8096 does it ask you what server you want to connect to?This lets you connect to and play another friend's Jellyfin rather nicely. I think it's also so the HTML and JS that forms the web interface can basically be the app as well.> And it doesn't seem to want to accept any answer as to what the server URL is.Should be \"http://192.168.100.xxx:8096\" - make sure your jellyfin isn't just set to listen on localhost only though.\n \nreply",
      "I am pretty sure that's a config option\n \nreply",
      "It may be, but it's also the default behavior and .. really... makes no sense at all.\n \nreply",
      "I love Jellyfin too, but there are a bunch of rough edges I run into often, like:Chromecast support is flaky.  Most of the time when I cast from my Android phone, the app immediately \"forgets\" that there's something playing back on the Chromecast (even though it's still connected to it), so I can't control playback at all.  It's also hit or miss if the Chromecast will successfully play the media if Jellyfin decides it needs to transcode it.So I got a little NUC-like box (Intel N100), and installed Jellyfin on it (it was previously running on an old 2012 Mac Mini running Linux).  I connected it directly to the TV and installed jellyfin-media-player on it, set to auto-login and start X on boot, with a minimal session that just runs JMP only in fullscreen mode.  I use JMP on my laptop, or the Android app, to control it.  JMP will randomly lose its connection to the Jellyfin server (even though it's running on the same machine), and won't try to reconnect, so nearly every time I go to use it, I have to ssh in and restart JMP so it reconnects.On top of that, I get occasional audio dropouts when watching 4k content, and sometimes see 4k video stuttering  (yes, hardware decoding is enabled for playback, and I've verified in the logs that it's being used).  At those times, the box is around 40% idle, and intel_gpu_top shows that the decode and render bits have what I think should be more than enough headroom to avoid that sort of thing.  I understand JMP uses libmpv for playback, so out of curiosity I tried playing video using mpv directly, and somehow JMP's player uses about 50% more CPU than mpv standalone does, and I don't hear any dropouts or see any stuttering on the same media.  I get that a video player that's embedded in an application might have some overhead, but 50% is a bit much.I get that Jellyfin is maintained by volunteers (I also maintain open source in my spare time, so I know how tough it can be to be responsive to user requests), but these issues are quite frustrating.  I don't want to use something closed like Plex or Emby (which may or may not be better), so it's still the right trade off for me.  And what it can do is truly amazing.  I love that I can play things while I'm on the go, VPN'ing to my home network, and Jellyfin will transcode down to a crappy-enough bitrate to fit within the confines of my garbage Comcast upload speed.\n \nreply",
      "Every once in a while I knock around the idea of migrating off Plex and onto Jellyfin. For a long time it was that sharing libraries with friends was a pain, but now literally the only thing stopping me is that they don't have a ps5 app, and that's how one of my friends uses my plex server lol. If they get one, it's all over for plex (in my friend group).\n \nreply",
      "Keep in mind that you don't necessarily need to \"migrate\" all at once. There's nothing wrong with running both Plex and Jellyfin pointed at the same media library, and using whichever one has the better client for a particular platform.\n \nreply"

As stated in https://scsh.net/docu/html/man-Z-H-2.html#node_sec_1.4> Scsh, in the current release, is primarily designed for the writing of shell scripts -- programming.

With Eshell and TRAMP, working across multiple remote systems becomes transparent, seamless, and effortless!

That said, background processes invoked from Eshell can be controlled the same way as any other background process in Emacs.For things like this, we would have to switch to something like M-x shell or even M-x ansi-term.  In Emacs, we have an assortment of shells and terminal implementations.  As a long time Emacs user, I know when to use which, so it does not bother me.  However, I can imagine how this might feel cumbersome for newer Emacs users.In fact, this is one of the reasons I think your project is fantastic.

I just keep a different machine around for anything gaming-ish, and don't worry about it.That said, if you have skipped out on trying Qubes because you think you lack sufficient hardware, my Qubes daily driver (and primary computer for personal use) is a 2015-era Lenovo X250, with a 2C/4T I7-5600U, 16GB RAM, and a SATA SSD.  It's limited in some ways, I can feel when I'm trying to do too much on it, but it is quite useful, and has been for some while.  The memory balancing between AppVMs works nicely, and you can safely reduce memory allocation for a lot of VMs.  A lot of my running Debian12 VMs are between 1GB and 2GB practical allocation, and work just fine.\n \nreply",

      "Anyone who isn't aware of this is either\n- Lying. \n- Paid by the oil industry.\n- Tricked by the oil industry.All you need is napkin maths. We gain energy by turning carbon into carbon dioxide. Now, we need the same energy to reverse it, but with a loss factor.We continue to see companies and politicians claiming it's feasible and will help us become \"green\". We should call them out on their shit. If we had the renewable power budget to use proper carbon capture on a large scale, we would already have a fully green grid.---Well... There are other methods than reversing c02 back into carbon chains.Capture of CO2 and storage as CO2, mostly in compressed gas form in underground, has been proposed by a lot of companies. This is a logistical nightmare that has to be kept up for forever. Better keep that pressure chamber leakproof for 1000 years with likely upkeep. (setting aside how inefficiently that actually stores the carbon even if grabbing it from the air was free)Ideas to shove c02 air bubbles in concrete are promising but barely enough to offset the c02 generated from creating the concrete itself.One promising approach is to grow plants and turn them into charcoal. Charcoal is great for keeping fertilizer in the soil so that we can spread it over crop fields for a small increase in yield. Napkin maths on that makes it just require about Australia of farmland (if I remember) to offset the world's CO2 emissions. Almost feasible. (bamboo, algae, and sunflowers seem to be the highest biomass generators, but perhaps a slower crop that can handle worse climate is preferable)But these are still worse plans than just building a green grid.\n \nreply",

The difference isn't huge, it's mostly changing data in some management frames and configuring the key exchange differently.It's very impressive that that developer found the right things to patch, with the right values.Looks like it has been in the works for a while.https://psp-archive.github.io/apps/wpa2.htmlhttps://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/04/4865-2/\n \nreply",

It\u2019s instead resulted in a Cambrian explosion of tactics, counter tactics, and really diverse team strategies. But the commentary and analysis in mainstream basketball hasn\u2019t caught up, so your average viewer is watching a chess match but not even understanding the basic moves. Which leads to frustration and confusion.[1]: https://youtu.be/fp4but75EjY?si=YdOqZZ5-sH6lQHd9\n \nreply",
      "> your average viewer is watching a chess match but not even understanding the basic movesYour average viewer isn't tuning in to watch a chess match. You'll notice that professional chess doesn't have the same viewership as basketball.Regardless of the mathematical strategies, it sucks to watch a bunch of three pointers getting missed. The NBA team average is 36% on 38 attempts per game. Thus, in an average game, there are 76 three-point attempts and 49 misses.The worst is when they take and miss a three-pointer early in the shot clock, maybe even from the logo. Shoot, clunk, possession over, yawn.Draymond Green just said that the modern game is rarely a chess match. https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/43860581/no-substance> Green talked about a recent Warriors game against the Los Angeles Lakers and how it was \"refreshing\" to go against a thinker like LeBron James, who is notorious for finding weaknesses and exploiting them.> \"Every possession is some type of chess move,\" Green said. \"You don't get that today in the NBA, often. ... You don't just get that on a regular basis. It's just who can run faster, who can hit more 3s. It's no substance. I think it's very boring.\"\n \nreply",
      "So I agree that more complexity is not better and there\u2019s a real risk of alienating fans with complicated schemes. But chess has made real inroads by providing good commentators and analysis. You can\u2019t make teams play dumber but you can teach fans to be smarter.As for missing, the video I linked debunks that. 3 pointers are replacing long 2 pointers which also had a low percentage. And in turn, the game has become less crowded and more spread out, leading to a higher percentage on dunks and layups. The pace has also dramatically increased, leading to more swings in scoring, which is pretty exciting.\n \nreply",
      "> As for missing, the video I linked debunks that. 3 pointers are replacing long 2 pointers which also had a low percentage.I'd much rather watch NBA players miss 3's than watch a 23 minute YouTube video of someone talking about missing 3's. ;-) But the NBA FG% in 2025 is 46.5%, while it was 49.1% in 1985, so I'm skeptical that 3 pointers are simply replacing long 2 pointers with equal percentages. Obviously the % would go down the farther you get from the basket.> And in turn, the game has become less crowded and more spread out, leading to a higher percentage on dunks and layupsCrowding is not necessarily bad.

A contested shot is interesting; an uncontested shot, not so much. Even uncontested dunks are less interesting than contested dunks.That's because you're thinking of a really cool dunk, not a big man backing down his man for like 20 seconds and throwing up a clanker that gets rebounded into another 20 second post possession.

Nobody moved; they just stood there.  Eventually somebody shot.I know it was late in the game and people were tired.  The shooting percentage may have been reasonably high.  I don't care.  That's terrible offense.  And horrifically boring.\n \nreply",

Long-range shooting and layups are preferred over mid-range shooting. Players are no longer do-it-alls; they are now given specialized roles.In the last decade, long-range shooting has gone from a secondary option to a primary choice for building offense. Recently, teams have realized three-pointers have higher point value despite their lower scoring percentage. This has led to a revolution in structuring an offense around taking long-range shots. The Golden State Warriors, led by Stephen Curry, probably jump-started this trend with 34 three-pointer attempts per game in the 2018-19 season, twice as much from five years ago.

      "The problem with the amyloid hypothesis is most likely not that it is wrong, but that it is incomplete, and I would say that is the problem with this test as well.I work in neurotech/sleeptech, and AD researchers are using (or want to use) slow-wave enhancement to prevent and possibly manage AD.However, the test for AD is still a psychological tests along with neuroimaging to look for tau tangles and amyloid plaque build up.It has been discussed that we may be looking at multiple different diseases which have similar symptoms and without completely understanding the disease itself, we are categorizing them as AD, though they may have different pathways.Though we can't ignore the challenges to the amyloid hypothesis, we also shouldn't completely throw it out. Most of the experts I've spoken with still believe it is the best hypothesis we have, but that we also should not ignore other possibilities.\n \nreply",
      "\"The problem with the amyloid hypothesis is most likely not that it is wrong, but that it is incomplete,\"If the hypothesis is that amalyoid causes AD, then I think we've disproved that (even with your statement that it's incomplete). If I remember correctly, there are individuals who have amalyoid without developing AD, or who have had their amalyoid levels reduced without improvement. At this point, it seems that amalyoid is more of a symptom than a cause. But you are correct that the data is dirty - many studies have not tested for amalyoid itself, instead relying on clinical diagnosis, and subsequent studies are finding at 25% of mild to moderate AD may be other forms of neural degeneration. So many of the AD studies out there focusing on amalyoid reduction are garbage because many of them happened before being able to use imaging to test amalyoid levels.\n \nreply",
      "It surprises me that some obvious clues to treatment are passed over as I guess they don't fit the politics? Like>A team of researchers in Jerusalem, he says, decided to look at patients who survived bladder cancer and compare dementia prevalence among patients treated with BCG and those who weren\u2019t. \u201cDo they differ in the rate at which they get Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\u201d The answer is yes \u2013 the BCG group appeared to get 75% protection against Alzheimer\u2019s. A number of studies have now found varying levels of protection from BCG, with an average, according to one meta\u2011analysis, of 45%.There's a lot of evidence a lot of it is set off by infectious microbes which can be treated in the usual way. (From https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/01/the-bra...)The 'politics' puzzles me. Maybe the head of department got fame for hypothesis A and feels his power or money is threatened by hypothesis B? It's not what science should be about.(There was an entertaining angry Sabine Hossenfelder\n youtube a few minutes ago on the corruption of science just wasting money, but really letting people die of Alzheimer's is worse. https://youtu.be/shFUDPqVmTg)\n \nreply",
      "I think the quote you provided shows exactly why it is so difficult.When you are comparing a group who survived bladder cancer and then looking at those numbers and figuring out if the bladder cancer treatment had a preventative effect on Alzheimer's, many many things are being conflated together.You initially have survivorship bias of those who were alive after bladder cancer. How many of the bladder cancer people had AD, or another disease? Though I'm sure the BCG treatment helped in their treatment of bladder cancer, did these people respond better to the bladder cancer treatment because of other factors? Did they have better lifestyle than those who did not, less inflammation, better diet, etc etc.How many women were in the study? AD affects twice as many women as men. If AD is an infectious disease, why would this be? Type 3 Diabetes is a strong candidate as an alternative theory to AD, but Type 2 Diabetes, though more damaging to women, does not occur at twice the rate as in men? So why would this be?Again, I'm not saying other theories are wrong, but everything is VERY difficult to prove.The Amyloid hypothesis, which I would also label as the sleep theory of AD, is tied to reduced glymphatic function, reducing the brain's ability to clear metabolic waste. Why would this affect women much more prominently than men? Motherhood and Menopause, both of which are very disruptive to women's sleep.Of course maternal diabetes can also play a significant role.I completely agree with Sabine Hossenfelder and you that improvements need to be made to the scientific process, including publishing of negative findings, and improved open discussion regarding published papers. I suggested to someone recently that they create a HackerNews of research papers and we don't just have citations, but open discussion of people expert in the space.There are letters in publications, but that is not directly tied and linked back to the paper. A friend was developing something similar to this years ago, but was never able to find enough traction or a business model that makes it work.\n \nreply",
      "There\u2018s also a weird relation with the oral microbiome. Probably not that surprising, seeing how much translocation is actually happening between our microbiomes.Just an n=1 ofc, but someone in my family got all their remaining teeth pulled and replaced with implants, and afterwards, within 3 years went from asymptomatic to dead from AD. The progression was mind boggling. I\u2018ve wondered for a long time whether the oral work was related to this - the surgery caused so much damage that it certainly exceeded capacity to heal, opening the doors wide for any pathogens.\n \nreply",
      "I agree to a point, but you also have to consider, why did they have to get their \"remaining teeth pulled\"? It is entirely likely the AD was present before the teeth were removed.I had an uncle with AD, and he hid it VERY well for quite a few years. We would have thought he was asymptomatic, but we suspect it was just that we didn't know.\n \nreply",
      "Is it not still the case that they do correlate, and therefore the article talking about them as biomarkers is not making the mistake you think it is (as if it was talking about them as the thing to get rid of to prevent Alzheimer's)? Because \"lead to\" is not the same as \"causes\".Or has latest research shown that even a non-causal link should be dismissed?\n \nreply",
      "Ok \u201clead to\u201d might not be exactly equivalent to \u201ccauses\u201d, but it\u2019s not even accurate because tau doesn\u2019t ALWAYS lead to Alzheimer\u2019s. The correlation is not strong. People have tau and no Alzheimer\u2019s and other people have Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms and no tau. So what good does it do you to test for tau? It\u2019s a higher probability of Alzheimer\u2019s, but not nearly definitive. I suspect that if this  test is productized, this nuance will be lost on many doctors.Seems like a good test to give someone so you can scare them into taking a drug that also has very little evidence of effectiveness.\n \nreply",
