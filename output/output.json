Its a bit of a PITA but well worth it to translate to a safe and informative user facing error.as a nit; RBAC is applied to an object based permissions system rather than being one. Simply, RBAC is a simplification of permission management in any underlying auth system.\n \nreply",

      "Right, you can go to cloudtrail and probably get it, but I have definitely ran into things like service says you do not have access to resource or it does not exist - randomly providing the account some other tangentially related permission magically fixes it, I've found sometimes trying the UI and the API will give different errors to help, and neither is particularly more useful than the others.\n \nreply",

      "Slightly disagree at least for GCP. It will error with a detailed permission, but you're not just going to add that -- you're going to add a role (standard, unless you have custom roles), which you technically have to map back to the permission you need.

I just had to figure it out, mostly by trial and error.

It built confidence.Now my kid sits infront of an OS (Windows, Mac, it doesn't really matter) and there's so much noise. Things popping up, demanding attention. Scary looking warnings. So much choice. There's so many ways to do simple things. Actions buried deep within menus. They have no hope of building up a mental model or understanding how the OS connects them to the foundations of computing.Even I'm mostly lost now if there's a problem. I need to search the internet, find a useful source, filter out the things that are similar to my problem but not the same. It isn't rewarding any more, it's frustrating.

      "My master's thesis[1] was half research, half dev project, exploring how we can continue to fully fuse traditional RPGs with computers. This goal is my life quest, my life's work.I think virtual tabletops (VTTs) as they currently stand are barking up the wrong tree[2]. I want a computer-augmented RPG to allow the GM to do everything he does in the analog form of the game. On-the-fly addition of content to the game world, defining of new kinds of content, defining and editing rules, and many other things ... as well as the stuff VTTs do, of course. The closest we've gotten in the last 30 years is LambdaMOO and other MUDs.The app I made for my thesis project was an experimental vertical slice of the kinds of functionality I want. The app I made after that last year is more practical and focused on the needs of my weekly game, in my custom system; I continue to develop it almost daily.I'm itching to tackle the hardest problem of all, which is fully incorporating game rules in a not-totally-hardcoded way. I need rules to be first-class objects that can be programmatically reasoned about to do cool things like \"use the Common Lisp condition system to present end user GMs with strategies for recovering from buggy rules.\" Inspirations include the Inform 7 rulebook system.[1] See my homepage, under Greatest Hits: https://www.mxjn.me[2] Anything that requires physical equipment other than dice and a regular computer is also barking up the wrong tree. So no VR, no video-tracked physical miniatures, no custom-designed tabletop, no Microsoft Surface... Again, just my opinion.\n \nreply",
      "FOSS MTG inspired digital card game.I love card games, but for digital card games the business model is beyond predatory. If you need a specific card your option is to basically buy a pack. Let\u2019s say this is about 3$ give or take. But if it\u2019s a specific rare card, you can open a dozen of so packs and still not get the specific card you want.This can go on indefinitely, and apologists will claim you can just work around this, by building a different deck. But the business model clearly wants you to drop 50 to 100$ just to get a single card.All for this to repeat every 3 months when they introduce new mechanics to nerf the old cards or just rotate out the dream deck you spent 100$+ to build.I\u2019m under no impression I\u2019ll directly compete, but it\u2019s a fun FOSS game you can spin up with friends. Or even since it\u2019s all MIT, you can fork and sell.It also gives me an excuse to use Python, looks like Django on the backend and Godot for the game client. Although the actual logic runs in Django so you can always roll a different game client.Eventually I\u2019d like different devs to roll their own game clients in whatever framework they want.Want to play from the CLI, sure\n \nreply"

Yet, thinking about it a bit, being nice when poor is just a life strategy that makes sense. Not only that one's precarious situation (of any kind) attracts a lot of vulnerability, it also attracts a lot of dependency on pretty much everyone's good grace. Being anything but nice by default means undermining one's success. There is not much to gain by being hostile when poor. When one gets to be rich (in relation to others) however, the game changes. People want things and it makes sense to direct their attention and energy on other people that (ideally) may have what they want or (at least) may assist them with getting what they want. And, many people would like to cut corners and resort to dirty tricks in doing so. It's not that hard to imagine what that rich folk has to face in relation with other ambitious and not so scrupulous individuals, what a winning strategy in this case would look like, and why it makes sense to become the default behavior.\n \nreply",

I prefer the older, time tested answer of what to do:>  You should be wise, brave, honest, temperate, and just, uphold tradition, and serve the public interestAs noted in the essay, this idea of \"taking care of the world\" is relatively new. PG claims it's because only now we can take care of the world, but I think it's just a naive idea that doesn't stand the test of time. I'm sure its not novel idea, and many others had thought of it and tried to implement some version of it in their society. But because it hasn't become cannon in any group or culture, it's a bad idea in that it doesn't produce human flourishing. Whereas ideas around wisdom, bravery, honesty, etc have replicated throughout cultures and led to everything we cherishThe idea is that you cannot take care of the world if you can't take care of yourself. So at first you must be these things. Ironically the most empathetic people I have met that purport to care most about \"the world\" are often the most dysfunctional people - substance abuse, medications, no strong family ties, anxiety, neuroticism, etc. These aren't people we should try to emulate.Only when you have your house in order can you attempt to help others. Start with the people immediately around you. People you know and love and that know and love you. If you've ever dealt with a family member with a serious problem, you'll see how difficult for you to help them. Now imagine helping a friend, then casual acquaintance, then stranger finally a stranger on the other side of the world.We should have humility as to what kind of impact we can have on the world and look inward to those around us where we can have the most impact.

We each are responsible for the environment (natural and man-made) that we inhabit, and to that extent it is our duty to help others and ourselves.We have been given many, many resources at our disposal, and we bear the responsibility to use them well.

It's also possible to be a little better than average at caring for the world without much cost to yourself. I don't understand why anyone would have a problem with the latter.\n \nreply",

      "> Even though DebugAny inherits from AnyI'm going to push back against this terminology for the sake of people who don't know Rust and are coming from traditional OO languages.Rust traits don't \"inherit\" from other traits, they \"require\" other traits.So if I have two traits, where one requires the other:    trait Foo {}\n\n    trait Bar: Foo {}\n\nThat doesn't add Foo's methods to Bar's list of methods, like you might expect from the term \"inheritance\".Instead, it just means that it's not possible to implement Bar for a type unless Foo is also separately implemented for that type.Despite this it's still accurate to say that this enables a supertype/subtype relationship in certain contexts, but be careful because Rust isn't a traditionally OO language, so that may not always be the most useful framing.\n \nreply",
      "> That doesn't add Foo's methods to Bar's list of methods, like you might expect from the term \"inheritance\".This is not completly correct. It's true you won't e.g. be able to implement `Foo` and specify `Bar`'s method in it, however it does mean that e.g. `dyn Foo` will support `Bar`'s methods.> Despite this it's still accurate to say that this enables a supertype/subtype relationship in certain contextsIt does enable something that looks like subtyping because you're allowed to use something that implements `Foo` when something that implements `Bar` is expected. However this is not called subtyping in Rust terms; subtyping in Rust exists but is unrelated to traits (it's only affected by lifetimes)\n \nreply",
      "It\u2019s not clear from that description how it differs from interface inheritance in OOP.In an interface/class hierarchy A < B < C, C can be an abstract class that only implements B\u2019s methods and not A\u2019s.\n \nreply",
      "In Rust, an implementation of a trait never implements methods that weren't defined on that trait explicitly. In your example, an implementation of C inherits from B and A, but only implements B's methods. In Rust, an implementation of C cannot itself implement B's or A's methods; it is merely allowed to assume that they have been implemented elsewhere. This also means that subtraits cannot override the behavior of methods defined on supertraits.\n \nreply",
      "Okay, but doesn't Bar nevertheless inherit Foo's methods in the sense of interface inheritance? Or does code that gets passed a Bar not get access to Foo's methods?\n \nreply",
      "> does code that gets passed a Bar not get access to Foo's methodsPrior to the current version of Rust it was impossible to access methods on `Foo` when a `&dyn Bar` was passed.  With the current beta version you can upcast.\n \nreply",
      "> Prior to the current version of Rust it was impossible to access methods on `Foo` when a `&dyn Bar` was passed.This has been working since Rust 1.0, I think:    trait Foo {\n        fn foo(&self);\n    }\n    trait Bar : Foo {}\n\n    impl Foo for () {\n        fn foo(&self) { println!(\"Hello\") }\n    }\n    impl Bar for () {}\n\n    fn xxx(x: &dyn Bar) {\n       x.foo();\n    }\n\n    pub fn main() {\n        xxx(&());\n    }\n\n> With the current beta version you can upcastRight. Now you can convert from `&dyn Bar` to `&dyn Foo` which wasn't possible before.\n \nreply",
      "Inherent method implementations were unavailable.  (Eg: impl dyn Foo) and then call this via Bar.\n \nreply",
      "It might be better to think of it this way: types in Rust do not implement traits, traits are implemented for types. It might seem subtle, but its not: a trait can be implemented for a type without that type's knowledge (obviously taking care for the orphan rule). Traits are also implemented via pattern matching (Into being implemented for all Froms is the most trivial example). Go's interfaces come closer to Rust traits than those from OOP languages.I've experienced a lot of fear in other people, especially when interviewing, about Rust not being OOP. Very smart people seem to be coming up with carve-outs to keep that religion alive. Try letting go of OOP for a month or two, and you'll find that you're better off letting OOP be someone else's problem.\n \nreply",
      "I think we have different notions of OOP. OOP without implementation inheritance and with extension interfaces/methods is still very much OOP to me.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "written on Thursday, March 27, 2025Three years ago I shared the As-Any Hack on\nthis blog.  That hack is a way to get upcasting to supertraits working on\nstable Rust.  To refresh your memory, the goal was to make something like\nthis work:The problem? Even though DebugAny inherits from Any, Rust wouldn't let you\nuse methods from Any on a dyn DebugAny.  So while you could call\nDebugAny methods just fine, trying to use downcast_ref from Any (the\nreason to use Any in the first place) would fail:The same would happen if we tried to cast it into an &dyn Any?  A\ncompile error again:But there is good news!  As of Rust 1.86, this is finally fixed. The cast\nnow works:At the time of writing, this fix is in the beta channel, but stable\nrelease is just around the corner.  That means a lot of old hacks can\nfinally be retired.  At least once your MSRV moves up.Thank you so much to everyone who worked on this to make it work!This entry was tagged\n    \n      rust\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025 by Armin Ronacher.\n    "

      "If you can bear with me while i attempt a synthesis here, I think this one line captures basically the entire dynamic, but the author seems to seriously underweight its explanatory value.> The average student has seen college as basically transactional for as long as I\u2019ve been doing thisIt is a transaction. The number of students there because they want to learn a subject rounds to zero. A college degree (especially from good old State U) serves first and foremost as a white-collar job permit. The students (or their parents/lender/state) are purchasing the permit from the institution. They are the customer. Anything you, the employee, ask of them beyond the minimum to hold up the fig leaf is a waste of the students' time (from their perspective) and a violation of the implied terms of this transaction.\n \nreply",
      "As a student currently, I'll also throw in this perspective.  The colleges themselves make it feel transactional and not about learning even if I'm interested in doing so.For example, I'm taking a physics course right now (electricity and magnetism).  The concepts are difficult for me and I was hoping that the homework would help.  So, I go to do the homework, but the homework is online.  With the online homework I get five chances to get the problem correct, but there is zero partial credit, zero feedback, and every time I get the answer wrong, it negatively impacts my grade.I have no chance to make mistakes and learn.  At least with homework that was handed out back in the day, there was at least the possibility of partial credit being handed out.  So my options are going to office hours (which I try to do), go to tutoring hours (which conflicts with my job's work schedule), or go to ChatGPT and/or Chegg.Additionally, since students have been cheating, I think it gives professors a skewed perspective on how much time is actually needed to get work done, so the deadlines get moved up.  This means I get even more pressure put on me when I'm just trying to learn and be a good student.\n \nreply",
      "In the 90s we had the \"Plato\" system for chemistry.  It was a question/answer terminal in the library.   Our Chemistry TA advised us to use it to study for exams as it had a lot of sample questions.  It was really good because if you got it wrong, it actually gave you a detailed explanation of how to solve it.  It was so helpful to have that.  When I used the system, I made a bunch of mistakes but ended up learning from them, and it really helped for the exams.1990, \"PLATO reached it's maximum enrollment, with 4,029 course seats and approximately 30 courses and other applications.\"  Plato was decommissioned in 1994.https://www.umass.edu/it/it-timelineHonestly as an engineer some of schooling was learning enough just to get by.  We always envied the non-engineers who had more freedom to choose classes they were fascinated by.For me the Masters Degree gives a better chance to dive deep into a single topic.\n \nreply",
      "> We always envied the non-engineers who had more freedom to choose classes they were fascinated by.Personally, I kind of pitied the non-STEM students.My own problem was there were not enough slots in the schedule for all the classes I wanted to take. I figured the university knew what it was doing with the required classes, and they were right.\n \nreply",
      "Interesting. When I was an undegraduate we had textbooks which were at least 25% problems and solutions, allowing for near endless self practice.I am currently holding my copy of \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\" by Griffiths in my hands; somehow it is rarely more than a metre from where I work!Are such textbooks still popular and used (i.e. mandatory to purchase) in courses like this?\n \nreply",
      "I started college at the CC level (having no HS diploma) to get into a State school. And from a series of poor choices and ignorance on my part needed to take a several years gap before returning to finish up.I don't think in my experience students have changed all that much.CC students have always felt more motivated in my opinion. But good Lord the quality of the education at the State level is abysmal. I am not saying there aren't quality professors and classes. There are.There is however an alarming high number of poorly designed classes, nearly broken technology, poorly edited and badly written assignments, and questionable instruction.I have to compare the quality and price with what I experienced in CC and it just makes me sad and depressed.\n \nreply",
      "The higher the level of education, the less attention paid to pedagogy. I had better teachers in high school than in college.\n \nreply",
      "> I don't think in my experience students have changed all that much.I'm actually somewhat inclined to agree with this. I also started at a community college first, so I got to see a lot of adults trying to do career switches into tech.Many of them were frankly the same if not worse than many of the young students you see in college today.  One could definitely attribute some of that to the fact that they have more responsibilities to handle impacting them, but even just overall demeanor was noticeably worse.  I frequently had adults 15-20 years older than me throwing their hands up and asking me to just give them the answers to what were ultimately very simple programming problems.It was great for me because I took it as an opportunity to reinforce the material we were learning, but I knew I was doing them a disservice, so at some point I would stop enabling the poor behavior.Honestly, to me the biggest thing impacting everyone is the inundation of information from technology today.  I know it sounds cliche, but it's making academics a billion times harder than it needs to be.  It's also making it less enjoyable and satisfying, thus people take the shortcut to get the grade they're looking for.\n \nreply",
      "I agree to some extent.  A wild one to me is how schools will limit the number of classes you can take and/or pressure you to graduate on time even if it means choosing a major before you're really ready.  That seems like a surefire way to kill any interest in exploring knowledge and replace it with a focus on mechanical box-checking.\n \nreply",
      "That homework setup sounds awful.  I wonder how much it was shaped by educators, and how much by techbros.\n \nreply"
