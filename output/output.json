Cloudflare, who take responsibility for nothing, has no way to report this kind of abuse to them.The domain which hosts the malware, 2x.si, both uses Cloudflare for DNS and is hosted by Cloudflare. At least it's possible to report this to Cloudflare, even though they rate limit humans and have CAPTCHAs on their abuse reporting forms.Sigh.

      "Whatever choices this project makes (I have some opinions, but I think they're not too important) I don't see it mentioning one of the most absolutely critical choices Nix made that was absolutely key to its insane success (at least, IMO, as a hardcore contributor and user for like 10+ years): the monorepo, containing all of the packages and all the libraries for use by everyone downstream, and all contributions trying to go there.Please do not give into the temptation to just write a version manager and stitch together some hodgepodge and throw the hard problem over the fence to the \"community\", a set of balkanized repositories to make everything work. It is really really really hard to overstate how much value Nixpkgs gets from going the monorepo route and how much the project has been able to improve, adapt, and overcome things thanks to it. It feels like Nixpkgs regularly pulls off major code-wide changes on an average Tuesday that other projects would balk at.(It's actually a benefit early on to just keep everything in one repo too, because you can just... clean up all the code in one spot if you do something like make a major breaking change. Huge huge benefit!)Finally: as a die hard Nix user, I also have been using Buck2 as a kind of thing-that-is-hermetic-cloud-based-and-supports-Windows tool, and it competes in the same space as Zb; a monorepo containing all BUILD files is incredibly important for things to work reliably and it's what I'm exploring right now and seeing if that can be viable. I'm even exploring the possibility of starting from stage0-posix as well. Good luck! There's still work to be done in this space and Nix isn't the final answer, even if I love it.\n \nreply",

Maybe they can make the connections less apparent without exposed coax, and maybe they won't need to add (extra) windows on top of windows, and maybe they can make the conductive areas more transparent, but this is only useful as a proof of concept.Let's see what they can do for a commercial product. Usually, there are tens of antennas on a single tower so they can't all look like this. Also, I'm going to assume that you have to keep anyone from getting within 3 meters just due to radiated emissions, so don't go just looking out that window!\n \nreply",
      "This is a commercial product, that\u2019s actually been installed and being used. The magic here is a \u201ctransparent\u201d antenna. The magic is a carefully tuned, small and innocuous antenna, that when mounted on a window it\u2019s been tuned for, allows 5G to easily propagate through the glass.Glass facades almost universally use Low-E glass to avoid turning the building into a huge greenhouse. Problem for 5G, is that low-e glass is remarkably good at blocking 5G frequencies[1]. Pair that with 5G smaller propagation distances, and issues of finding viable locations to mount 5G antenna becomes a real problem.This product neatly solves that problem by allowing carriers to mount these antenna on the inside of a buildings facade, while providing coverage outside the building. Which will substantially reduce the cost and difficulty of installing 5G masts. You can place all your sensitive equipment in normal building voids, without the need for bulky and ugly weather proofing, and you need to break the buildings weather tight seals (which a landlord isn\u2019t gonna let you do without significant assurances you\u2019re going the cover the costs of any water that comes through) to run cables to external antenna.To make all of this viable, someone has had to do a fair bit of work to figure out how to build an antenna that effectively incorporates the low-e window it\u2019s attached to, into its RF design. The fact the physical antenna is made of glass and partial transparent isn\u2019t actually the interesting part. That\u2019s likely been done because glass is a very rigid material that will make it easy to ensure the conductive parts of the antenna are kept at a specific distance from the window it\u2019s mounted on, to ensure the correct RF coupling occurs.[1] https://www.ranplanwireless.com/gb/resources/low-e-glass/\n \nreply",

But while it offers lower latency than precursor networks, 5G also requires more base stations. To avoid installing unsightly equipment on more and more shared spaces, Japanese companies are developing transparent glass antennas that allow windows to serve as base stations that can be shared by several carriers.Because 5G networks include spectrum comprising higher frequencies than 4G, base stations for 5G networks serve a smaller coverage footprint.

I remember reading Colin Percival's classic Cryptographic Right Answers[0] and saw a section about \"symmetric signatures.\" I pondered to myself what scheme I could use for that before I looked at the answer: of course it's just HMAC. I feel like this is another perspective that ought to be more widely known: if you want something to be like a signature, but the two parties (or just a single party at different times) can share a key, HMAC really is the right answer. Things like, a server needs to cryptographically sign a cookie to prevent tempering: that's HMAC.

The registry would be a mapping of public keys to encrypted records. Updates could be accomplished by sending a record with a greater timestamp, which would then be propagated to other nodes.You could also put a DHT on top of that to minimize storage requirements, perhaps also a PoW scheme for sibil resistance.[1] EC doesn't technically do encryption, but that can be worked around by attaching a public key for an ephemeral keypair for your message, doing a DH against the two keypairs, and using the resulting secret as a key for symmetric encryption.\n \nreply",

      "This is incredible. I uploaded a CSV with ~6000 rows containing campaign finance data for a particularly corrupt local politician and asked \"what was the total contributed amount in [year]\". Not only did it produce the correct answer (in around the same amount of time it took me to calculate it on my end) but it also seemed to understand that the spreadsheet was related to campaign finance in the \"summary\" portion of the response.The most useful aspect was that I could ask \"what was the total contributed amount between January and June of 2020\" and get an accurate answer for that as well. Since the date column is provided as an \"MM/DD/YYYY\" string, I would normally have to do some boilerplate work to sanitize this.For my particular use case, the charting aspect left a few things to be desired - once I grouped campaign donations by contributor, I could only see the first 10 rows in the AI response, with no option to expand the output. But overall I was truly blown away that something like this is even possible for a small team to build.\n \nreply",
      "Interesting.  I think you're on to something here.  I fully agree that a combination of spreadsheets and SQL are the ideal tools for data analysis -- not a SaaS GUI.> Niching down, if you work in operations at a <50 person startup or SMB and your company relies on a Postgres or MySQL database, Sourcetable is an affordable reporting tool with turnkey data infrastructure that doesn\u2019t require code or engineers to set up.With the rise of AI, companies like Tembo that help you set up all in one databases, and tools like this, I'm increasingly of the mind that many companies should start bringing things like analytics and observability in-house.  I don't see the need to pay Mixpanel or Datadog thousands of dollars per month when a self-serve solution that relies on tried and true tech is more or less at your fingertips.\n \nreply",
      "Agree. A general thesis I have is that the API-ification of the web fragmented business information, and with every new SaaS tool we fragment our company's data further. The trend at all company sizes is to be increasingly analytical, but for SMBs it's too hard to get access to your data (mainly due to technical limitations). So it makes sense to centralize data somewhere, and we think that somewhere is inside the data tool that everyone actually uses: the spreadsheet.Many other advantages of this data centralization too. Data + spreadsheets + compute is a nice application base for agents.\n \nreply",
      "> So it makes sense to centralize data somewhereModelling and integrating datasets that you don't own is extremely hard.Shopify for example updates their API every 3 months.How much time and money do you think an SMB can afford to spend on this before the ROI becomes so poor that they abandon it entirely.\n \nreply",
      "Yes some integrations are excellent (hey Stripe : ), some are terrible (no comment on who). We're finding that LLMs increasingly able to fill the gap around organizing data schema for that initial data prep piece where someone has to build the data tables that others consume. To your specific question/problem set, when a schema updates you end up with a \"fuzzy schema matching problem\"; we are solving that separately anyways for a separate product feature requirement.Strong note here that the current state of technology is much better for SMB scale data and not enterprise scale data with messy schemas.\n \nreply",
      "There is a separate answer here which is many (most?) SMBs can't afford technical folk, so the ability integrate data at all, talk to it and model it (using SQL or AI), is already a big step forward for them.My personal use case tends to involve a lot of Postgres data and transaction events for my reporting. We see \"simple\" businesses like parts manufacturers, print shops, vineyards, etc. all doing something similar.\n \nreply",
      "Minus the AI part tools like this have existed for decades.And companies are not dumping their SaaS tools and switching to them en masse.Because (a) data silos have dramatically increased pushing dreams of a unified data schema out of reach, (b) technology stacks have become far more complex necessitating tools like Datadog and (c) competition is stronger than ever meaning that skimping on paying for tools like MixPanel is often short sighted and counter productive.Companies like this will do fine and there will be always be a demand for them especially in the SMB space. But there simply isn't the business value in bringing a lot of analytics and observability in-house in almost all cases.\n \nreply",
      "Not yet.  But in the analytics case, suppose you could build a tool that collected data on your own infrastructure, allowed you to write plain SQL against a PostgreSQL database to get whatever analytics data you need, had an AI-driven text-to-SQL option so non-technical users could get whatever analytics data _they_ need, and output everything to a universal interface, i.e. a spreadsheet?  No vendor flavored DSL, GUI, or workflows to learn.  That product would be tough to beat.  It wasn't built in the past because it was hard.  But with AI and something like Tembo or Timescale, is it actually hard anymore?\n \nreply",

      "I always wonder where these spreadsheet/database apps will land. Usually it falls flat for one of a few reasons I\u2019ve observed:- Fundamental gap in skillset, in that if you want to have ultimate flexibility to slice and dice the data and report on whatever you\u2019re seeking, you\u2019ve ultimately needed SQL skills in the past (which isn\u2019t rocket science, but also isn\u2019t something most accounting users can run with on their own).- Fundamental desire of users to work with unstructured data. This goes back at least as far as Excel vs Lotus Improv in the early 90\u2019s. Joel Spolsky talked about this, how they were terrified that Lotus Improv was going to kill Excel, because Improv was built to work with structured data, which users could then query and ask questions of to get any answer they want. But it turned out, as they observed people using both apps, there were zero users that used 100% normalized, structure data.- Imperfect translation between spreadsheet and database. I\u2019ve seen these work well 99.9% of the time, but at some point a column gets added or something that throws off formulas. And 0.1% error is basically catastrophic in accounting.Maybe LLMs help overcome these challenges. Wish you luck.\n \nreply"

      "One of the people I went to school with (several years ahead, his assembly class was on VAX rather than MIPS) had to write a program that solved a polynomial.As he was going through the tome that represented the CISC instruction set of a VAX system (long before easy search engines), he found POLY ( https://www.ece.lsu.edu/ee4720/doc/vax.pdf page 9-118).So, his program, instead of doing all the calculations was setting up a few registers, a large comment block that explained it, a call to POLY, and reading out the registers.He claimed to have gotten full credit and within a handful of semesters later the course was switched from CISC architectures to RISC.\n \nreply",

      "In high school, after getting my TI-83+, I also started to learn to program things.For tests, my teachers would force me to clear my memory (you're not fooling catholic nuns with a fake screen, she would take my calculator and clear it herself).But I got good at programming. I was so fast that I would just spend the first 30 minutes of a 1-hour test re-writing the programs and then spend 5 minutes completing the test and be excused to go to the computer lab for the remainder.Eventually I got so annoyed of typing things out on the TI-83+ keyboard, and as I progressed the programs got more complex, that I bought a TI-92 with a qwerty keyboard and would be able to write solvers the test in 5-10 minutes and fully solve a test in 5-10 minutes. I mostly did it so I could have more time in the computer lab.I still have those calculators too, I should see if they still work some day :)\n \nreply",

      "I did the same thing, implementing formulas we learned as interactive programs in TI-BASIC. I don't think I even tried to hide them or use them on tests or anything, but when I told my teacher at the time (2003-ish?) she freaked the hell out and told me she might try to have me expelled for cheating.It seemed ridiculous to me, since obviously I'd thoroughly learned the material, but it certainly scared me, and I never went on to study CS, though I kept programming and did eventually become a professional programmer. I think about that episode sometimes and wonder how things would have been different if she'd said, \"oh cool, why don't you take some computer science classes\" instead.\n \nreply"
