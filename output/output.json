I've enjoyed Danny Rozin's unconvenional mirrors over the years and was inspired by an eInk movie player that played at 24 frames per hour that got me thinking about a laborious display that could slowly assemble an image.I landed on the idea of a 40\u00d725 pixel grid of pixels, turned one by one by a single mechanism. Compared to our modern displays with millions of pixels changing 60 times a second, a wooden display that changes a single pixel 10 times a minute is an incredibly inefficient way to create an image. Conveniently, 40\u00d725 = 1,000 pixels, leading to the name Kilopixel and the six-letter domain name kilopx.com. How do you back down from that? That's the best domain name I've ever owned.So I got to work. This project has everything: a web app, a physical controller, a custom CNC build, generated gco"

      "First off, congrats, this is no small feat, well done.A question: in my (limited) experience, ERPs are made on the basis of integrations. I'd have thought the best priority order would be data-model first, integration second, everything else third. How do you think about this? What's the goal here?And secondly, some feedback: It looks like Carbon falls into the same trap as many self-hostable SaaS-like products (including my own!), and that is that software designed for one single hoster is often more complex to deploy and built in a different way, whereas software designed primarily to self-host looks much simpler. As an example, installing Wordpress or Odoo is relatively simple, with basic frontend webserver config and easy to run open source databases. Carbon on the other hand appears to be quite a few different components, with many dependencies, some of which are SaaS products, and uses a database (Supabase) which is itself a whole microservice ecosystem that is a considerable effort to deploy. What's the strategy here? Despite having the skills for it, I'm not sure I'd ever consider self-hosting Carbon, and maybe that's good for Carbon as a business, but it's also less good for the ecosystem.reply",

      "I've been playing around with it for the past hour. It's really good but from my preliminary testing it definitely falls short of gpt-image-1 (or even Imagen 3/4) where reasonably complex strict prompt adherence is concerned. Scored around ~50% where gpt-image-1 scored ~75%. Couldn't handle the maze, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, etc.https://genai-showdown.specr.netreply",

      "I think it does way more than gpt-image-1 too?Besides style transfer, object additions and removals, text editing, manipulation of human poses, it also supports object detection, semantic segmentation, depth/edge estimation, super-resolution and novel view synthesis (NVS) i.e. synthesizing new perspectives from a base image. It\u2019s quite a smorgasbord!Early results indicate to me that gpt-image-1 has a bit better sharpness and clarity but I\u2019m honestly not sure if OpenAI doesn\u2019t simply do some basic unsharp mask or something as a post-processing step? I\u2019ve always felt suspicious about that, because the sharpness seems oddly uniform even in out-of-focus areas? And sometimes a bit much, even.Otherwise, yeah this one looks about as good.Which is impressive! I thought OpenAI had a lead here from their unique image generation solution that\u2019d last them this year at least.Oh, and Flux Krea has lasted four days since announcement!

      "The pricing seems reasonable for a SOTA class model that needs to be commercially viable or it dies.reply",

Maybe as image models become bigger there will be more of a push to implement it.reply",
      "40GB is small IMO: you can run it on a mid-tier Macbook Pro... or the smallest M3 Ultra Mac Studio! You don't need Nvidia if you're doing at-home inference, Nvidia only becomes economical at very high throughput: i.e. dedicated inference companies. Apple Silicon is much more cost effective for single-user for the small-to-medium-sized models. The M3 Ultra is ~roughly on par with a 4090 in terms of memory bandwidth, so it won't be much slower, although it won't match a 5090.Also for a 20B model, you only really need 20GB of VRAM: FP8 is near-identical to FP16, it's only below FP8 that you start to see dramatic drop-offs in quality. So literally any Mac Studio available for purchase will do, and even a fairly low-end Macbook Pro would work as well. And a 5090 should be able to handle it with room to spare as well.reply"

      "How well can one learn financial literacy and how to manage money when one lacks financial assets and money of any significant amount?I am not questioning that one can learn enough to pass the lessons, but often times, lessons fail to prepare for the real world.I personally consider myself to be quite keen in the areas of financial literacy compared to most people. To be honest, I owe most of what I learned to two things:1. Being addicted to Runescape in my youth back in the early 2000s. I am dead serious too. For a boring grindy point-and-click adventure, the game really had a lot of real world lessons packed in to it -- predominately to much of the game's economy depending on interactions with other players at the time.2. Some unpleasant experiences growing up, but I do not feel like those had as much as an impact as #1, oddly enough.One important point about the game is that I had stake in the game, so to speak. I put a lot of (wasted) time  and (wasted) effort into the game in order to earn more and more fake, virtual currency. However, that in-game currency, at the time, had a lot of value to me. Every decision I made with the in-game currency had to be calculated and tact. \"How do I earn enough for <x>?\" If I spend <y>, I can afford <z>, but won't have enough for <a>\" And so on.I feel like in a lesson on a platform like EconTeen might lack that \"stake\" or \"value\" that MMORPG resources or real world money has. I am not trying to say EconTeen is a subpar product or anything like that. I am just thinking about myself, once a teenager, and I know I would have learned just enough to make it through these lessons as fast possible so that I may return to my video game as fast as possible.reply",

      "> There are valid reasons why college students in particular might prefer that AI do their writing for them: most students are overcommitted;Tangentially: I've helped out some college students with mentoring and advice from time to time. One common theme I've noticed is that their class load virtually doesn't matter. They find ways to run out of time no matter how much free time they start with.We all like to imagine the poor, overburdened college student working 2 jobs and attending classes to make ends meet when reading statements like that. But to be completely honest, the students like that usually have their time management on point. The hardest ones to coach were the students who had no real responsibilities outside of classes, yet who found their free time slipping through their fingers no matter what they did.Among all of the other problems with easy AI cheating, I wonder how much the availability of these tools will encourage even more procrastination. Feeling like you always have the fallback option of having ChatGPT write the homework for you leaves the door open to procrastinating even longer> I asked my students to complete a baseline survey registering their agreement with several statements, including \u201cIt is unethical to use a calculator in a math class\u201dUnless there was more to this survey, this wording seems misleading. In a college-level math class, using a calculator is a common expectation depending on the type of class and the problem.

      "I've gone back to university as an adult to study econometrics, already with a software background.It has been quite an adjustment, the hardest part isn't really the content, there have just been assessment tasks that are more demanding in time than cognition. I think a big part has been these are introductory subjects.You have much less agency over your schedule outside university itself than you would have when you're working as well, which has been a massive PITA having previously worked as a software engineer for quite a while. As an institution it just doesn't respect peoples time, which is fine when you're much younger and you're just coming out of school (another institution that doesn't care for your time outside of it).I think my problems have been compounded by the fact this is a undergraduate degree not a masters. There was only a masters for applied Econ in my area (which is much less data and math focused than econometrics), I've had this conversation 100 times, not looking to repeat that, trust me the moment I see an option to change to a masters in my area of interest in the city I live in, I would jump at it. But my choice to go back to uni to some extent is an as much an act of consumption as it is getting a piece of paper to saying \"you can trust this man with econ\".Anyways in these first year subjects, you'll have assessment tasks like \"make a recording of you demonstrating your understanding of <basic function in excel>, explain the value of <basic function in excel>\". They are easy subjects but they are also really time consuming so to some extent it feels degrading. I would take steps to skip the subject based on my prior experience but the focus of these subjects isn't even Excel, its just thrown in there because they anticipate you have little experience with these things and it'll be useful in later subjects when it becomes assumed knowledge.Edit: phrasingreply",

      "I've been thinking about this for a while too as an FSRS developer [1].In general, we can think of a spaced repetition system as being (i) Content-aware vs. Content-agnostic and (ii) Deck-aware vs. Deck-agnosticContent-aware systems care about what you're studying (language, medecine, etc) while Content-agnostic systems don't care about what you're studying.Deck-aware systems consider each card in the context of the rest of the cards (the \"deck\") while Deck-agnostic systems consider each card in pure isolation.Currently, FSRS is both Content-agnostic as well as Deck-agnostic. This makes it extremely easy to integrate into a spaced repetition system, but this also means the model will underfit a bit.It it interesting to note that you could in practice optimize seperate FSRS models for each deck covering different topics, which would make it Content-aware in a sense. Additionally, \"fuzz\" is a somewhat Deck-aware feature of the model in that it exists specifically to reduce interactions between other cards in the deck.[1] https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/py-fsrsreply",
      "I ran into a question a while ago that I couldn't find a good answer to, and while it's not exactly on topic this seems like a good place to ask it.I was working in a detail rich context, where there were a lot of items, about which there were a lot of facts that mostly didn't change but only mostly. Getting a snapshot of these details into approximately everyone's head seemed like a job for spaced repetition, and I considered making a shared Anki deck for the company.What wasn't clear was how to handle those updates.  Just changing the deck in place feels wrong, for those who have been using it - they're remembering right, the cards have changed.Deprecating cards that are no longer accurate but which don't have replacement information was a related question.  It might be worth informing people who have been studying that card that it's wrong now, but there's no reason to surface the deprecation to a person who has never seen the card.Is there an obvious way to use standard SRS features for this? A less obvious way?  A system that provides less standard features?  Is this an opportunity for a useful feature for a new or existing system?  Or is this actually not an issue for some reason I've missed?reply",
      "Being easy to integrate is an underappreciated feature of FSRS.Using decks to draw semantic boundaries is likely overly constraining. I think we want to account for finer differences between cards. Decks are coarse and people differ in the ways they use them, some people recommend having just one global deck. Notes are too fine. We explored something in between: a note capturing an idea or concept, plus an associated set of cards. Turns out it's hard to draw idea boundaries. That's why I think it's easier to relate cards by semantic embeddings or more rigid but clearer structures, like the DAG of dependencies suggested elsewhere in this thread.reply",
      "On the scheduling end, I'm surprised the article didn't mention https://github.com/fasiha/ebisu which uses Bayesian statistics.When I was studying Japanese, I was thinking how it's always best to learn words in sentences and that it would be good if the sentences for a particular word were random.Extending that, the sentences could be picked such that the other words are words scheduled for today meaning much more bang for buck per learning hour.reply",

It\u2019s too dynamic for a traditional SRS app like Anki which is pretty static in nature.reply",
      "I explored memory models for spaced repetition in my master's thesis and later built an SRS product. This post shares my thoughts on content-aware memory models.I believe this technical shift in how SRS models the student's memory won't just improve scheduling accuracy but, more critically, will unlock better product UX and new types of SRS.reply",
      "I've been playing with something similar, but far less thought out than what you have.I have a script for it, but am basically waiting until I can run a powerful enough LLM locally to chug through it with good results.Basically like the knowledge tree you mention towards the end, but attempt to create a knowledge DAG by asking a LLM \"does card (A) imply knowledge of card (B) or vice versa\". Then, take that DAG and use it to schedule the cards in a breadth first ordering. So, when reviewing a new deck with a lot of new cards, I'll be sure to get questions like \"what was the primary cause of the civil war\", before I get questions like \"who was the Confederate general who fought at bull run\"reply",
      "I'd love to see it.What I like about your approach is that it circumvents the data problem. You don't need a dataset with review histories and flashcard content in order to train a model.reply",
      "I'm building a SRS language learning app [1] so I've thought about this topic a bit, but I've come to a conclusion that srs algorithms might be just a nerd optimization obsession. My app has \"stupid\" 1,3,7,15,30 or something like that intervals, and the reality is that if I know a card, I can swipe it within 2 seconds, and if I just barely know it, I can spend 30 seconds on it.So optimizing the algorithm such that every card comes at the exact right moment might cause all cards to feel too hard or too easy.

I knew it was AI from the start.It was just that when I got done with it, I realized that I had talked at a computer for ~45 minutes. And, yet again, I was going to be ghosted by the company (I was), and that I was never going to get those 45 minutes back. That was time I could have used to apply for another job, or cook, or sleep, or exercise, or spend time with family. But no, like an idiot, I talked at a bot for that time for literally no reason.Like, sure maaaaybe the company is going to use it as a screen for 'real' people. But the odds that it's not just another hoop they have for you to jump through are nil. If they send an AI 'interview' at you, that's the exact same as an email requesting yet more portfolio submissions. Pointless.reply",
      "I'd hate being interviewed by a bot. Talking to these stupid automated answering machines is bad enough.That said, the other side of the equation is also bad, for employers. I was asked to conduct some interviews recently. I asked the most basic of questions (like absolutely basic stuff, \"what is an interface?\" level basic). The number of people who said \"I don't know\" is far less than the number of people who tried to spin stories, make shit up on the fly etc. One guy boasted that he learned programming on his current job (never coded before) and now is a rock star leading a team of 5 people. His confidence was so high, I thought we might have a winner. For the next 20 minutes, he couldn't answer anything, even from his own resume. That is not even the worst part - while leaving, he had the audacity to ask \"When can I start?\".Recruiting is broken from all sides.

Seems like nobody cares anymore about communication skills and how it's supposed to be a two way street. Though on one of the comments I might've missed the sarcasm considering the suggestion of ending the answer with a classic LLM trope.Now if a terse question deserves a terse answer that's to be judged on a case by case basis, I suppose.reply",
      "As someone who interviewed people for technical roles, I'd see that as a bad sign and answer: \"Just tell me what you can think about.\"This isn't school where teachers give you trick questions and you fail if you misunderstand it. If you are applying as a software developer and you can't talk at length about various forms of interfaces you are probably not very experienced. UI, API, ABI are all interfaces..reply",

Much of the technical jargon I've been learning during development involve things like \"driver interfaces\" and \"communication interfaces\".Depending on how recently I'd been working on our printer drivers I also would likely need clarification.

      "> My personal theory is that this is because you can make every sound you hear in English using the Devnagari script, but not the other way around.This is not very close to true. English (even a given accent) has a rather high number of phonemes, and they don\u2019t overlap very closely with Hindi. What is probably more relevant here is that Devanagari is relatively phonetic so writing in it is useful to describe English pronunciations, more so than the English script is for Hindi (or English, for most unfamiliar words).A very incomplete list of languages by approximate number of phonemes:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of...reply",
      "I think both you and GP are correct, but in different ways.It's true that the English language has a very large number of phonemes... but accents tend to regularize/restrict these phonemes. For example, a typical bilingual speaker of Indian English and Hindi will replace instances of the /\u00e6/ phoneme (as in \"blast\" or \"fast\") with another phoneme like /a:/ (as in \"father\"). Which isn't that unusual since /\u00e6/ is pretty uncommon among languages.Other rare English phonemes include the dental fricatives, i.e. the \"th\" sounds in \"ether\" (voiceless) and \"either\" (voiced). Speakers of Indian English often replace this with a dental stop, a \"t\" sound (voiceless) or \"d\" sound (voiced). (Note that Devanagari has a _lot_ of stops, so this is one place where it cannot be cleanly encoded into the Latin alphabet without diacritics.)So overall: while I think Devanagari can't encode e.g. American English, it can actually do a pretty solid job of encoding Indian English, but not the other way around.reply"

More so because I could see that there were several non-digital methods and techniques of sign-making popular in the country at different times, and many design idioms flourished.Of course, ignoring local design"

      "That\u2019s good advice for a layman but most high earners can do much better if they care and are motivated. Most are neither though lol.Mostly on the tax side. Some specific examples:- after maxing out your 401k what should you do next? IRA? Mega backdoor roth? Something else?- If you have kids, how to best save for future education expenses? Hint: consider 529 plan.- HSA is technically the best tax advantaged account, most high earners don\u2019t realize it and \u201cwaste\u201d the HSA funds to reimburse typical medical bills. HSA has triple tax benefits: contributions are tax-free, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free after age 65 for any reason, not just medical expenses. So basically investing without any tax obligation. You can also withdraw tax free before 65, but for medical expenses only.i could go on\u2026investing is great, but reducing your tax obligation is an even more powerful technique if you want to grow your net worth.reply",
      "The HSA thing intrigued me and so I did some digging. It appears that post-65, you still have to pay income tax on non-medical withdrawals from an HSA? That is, besides the tax-free-for-medical-expenses part it reverts to a traditional IRA?One additional trick though is that it looks like you can pay for any HSA-eligible medical expenses (incurred after you created the HSA) out-of-pocket now, and reimburse your bills at any point in the future? Thus you can still earn interest on the cash before withdrawing it at any point in the future (treating it as tax-free liquidity).(I don't fully understand this so these are questions not statements, but hopefully I'm correct!)reply",

In this blog post, I want to lay out the approach we took to build our new Rust database with DST principles front-and-center and how it compares to the approach we took with FrostDB.As a quick recap, DST tests are randomized full system integration tests where any failure can be reproduced using the same initial random seed. DST helps you find complex bugs in your system before customers hit them in production. Since failures can be deterministically reproduced, it significantly reduces the time needed to replicate hard-to-find bugs and streamlines the debugging process so that more time can be spent on feature work.

There was always a feeling of being second best - always America in the news, not Australia; always NSW or Victoria for settings, not Queensland; always Sydney or Melbourne, not Brisbane.The first time I watched Bluey, immediately I could see not just vague Australianisms, but actual places and sights I recognised.

      "I think the memory of slime molds (which are referenced in the article) can go further than merely relying on paths of slime they leave behind.Recently, I acquired a sample of Physarium polycephalum and have been keeping it as a sort of \"pet\", if one can call it that.  For those who don't know, slime molds like Physarium are actually considered a single-celled organism, at least when it's in its plasmodial phase.  People typically feed them oat flakes because that's what they seem to love most, though I started trying some other foods to see what my little slime mold would be willing to eat.  Carby things like pieces of bread, etc.  The funny thing is that it seemed to really like those other foods, even multiple feedings in a row, but would then spontaneously refuse to respond to those same foods again.  I've heard some anecdotes suggesting I'm not the only one to witness this.  It really does seem like the slime mold is \"remembering\" at a level that may go beyond slime trails.reply",
      "\"Remember?\" this sounds more like we have so little observation of cells that when they respond to stimuli they have receptors for, we just never know that receptor existed.Anthropomorphizing cells as anything beyond little machines seems silly.reply",
      "If a cell has an injury that impacts its mobility but not its ability to survive because it can adapt -- is that a memory? Are nutrients within a cell? How about its current position in relationship to  a food source? Or a buildup of some molecule in response to environmental factors? If not to any of these, why not? Because it's not neuronal by-nature?The past dictates the future and there are many, many, many, many, MANY ways to encode the past for future self-preservation.You're doing yourself an intellectual disservice by sticking to one form of \"memory\". I'd even argue that you're the one anthropomorphizing the hardest by limiting \"memory\" to an idealized human form of memory.reply",
      "\"Memory\" can be used to refer to any form of statefulness, which is mostly what's being discussed here. I agree the article engages in some unwarranted anthropomorphism in some places, but there's still plenty of interesting material without that.reply",
      "You might want to look into the work of Michael Levin\u2019s lab to give you a broader perspective on the intelligence of individual cells and tissues. Your machine metaphor is arguably as misleading as anthropomorphization.Edit: did you read the article? The examples described go far beyond your straw man about undiscovered receptors.reply"

She was famously publicity averse \u2014 nearly a hermit \u2014 but it\u2019s customary for people to speak when they\u2019re awarded a Nobel Prize, so she delivered a halting account of the experiments that had led to her discovery, in the early 1950s, of how DNA sequences can relocate across the genome. Near the end of the speech, blinking through wire-framed glasses, she changed the subject, asking: \u201cWhat does a cell know of itself?\u201dMcClintock h"
