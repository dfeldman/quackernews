There are proposals to try and \"fix\" this within POSIX, but they won't help in dealing with the current situation (see also how to deal with filenames correctly).  In its default mode, if standard output isn't a terminal, ls separates filenames with newlines.  This is fine until you have a file with a newline in its name.
