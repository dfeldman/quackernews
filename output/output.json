      "I've found using these and similar tools that the amount of prompts and iteration required to create my vision (image or video in my mind) is very large and often is not able to create what I had originally wanted. A way to test this is to take a piece of footage or an image which is the ground truth, and test how much prompting and editing it takes to get the same or similar ground truth starting from scratch. It is basically not possible with the current tech and finite amounts of time and iterations.\n \nreply",
      "It just plain isn't possible if you mean a prompt the size of what most people have been using lately, in the couple hundred character range. By sheer information theory, the number of possible interpretations of \"a zoom in on a happy dog catching a frisbee\" means that you can not match a particular clip out of the set with just that much text. You will need vastly more content; information about the breed, information about the frisbee, information about the background, information about timing, information about framing, information about lighting, and so on and so forth. Right now the AIs can't do that, which is to say, even if you sit there and type a prompt containing all that information, it is going to be forced to ignore most of the result. Under the hood, with the way the text is turned into vector embeddings, it's fairly questionable whether you'd agree that it can even represent such a thing.This isn't a matter of human-level AI or superhuman-level AI; it's just straight up impossible. If you want the information to match, it has to be provided. If it isn't there, an AI can fill in the gaps with \"something\" that will make the scene work, but expecting it to fill in the gaps the way you \"want\" even though you gave it no indication of what that is is expecting literal magic.Long term, you'll never have a coherent movie produced by stringing together a series of textual snippets because, again, that's just impossible. Some sort of long-form \"write me a horror movie staring a precocious 22-year old elf in a far-future Ganymede colony with a message about the importance of friendship\" AI that generates a coherent movie of many scenes will have to be doing a lot of some sort of internal communication in an internal language to hold the result together between scenes, because what it takes to hold stuff coherent between scenes is an amount of English text not entirely dissimilar in size from the underlying representation itself. You might as well skip the English middleman and go straight to an embedding not constrained by a human language mapping.\n \nreply",
      "What you are saying is totally correct.And this applies to language / code outputs as well.The number of times I\u2019ve had engineers at my company type out 5 sentences and then expect a complete react webapp.But what I\u2019ve found in practice is using LLMs to generate the prompt with low-effort human input (eg: thumbs up/down, multiple-choice etc) is quite useful. It generates walls of text, but with metaprompting, that\u2019s kind of the point. With this, I\u2019ve definitely been able to get high ROI out of LLMs. I suspect the same would work for vision output.\n \nreply",
      "I'm not sure, but I think you're saying what I'm thinking.Stick the video you want to replicate into -o1 and ask for a descriptive prompt to generate a video with the same style and content. Take that prompt and put it into Sora. Iterate with human and o1 generated critical responses.I suspect you can get close pretty quickly, but I don't know the cost. I'm also suspicious that they might have put in \"safeguards\" to prevent some high profile/embarrassing rip-offs.\n \nreply",

      "I\u2019m a quantum dabbler so I\u2019ll throw out an armchair reaction: this is a significant announcement.My memory is that 256 bit keys in non quantum resistant algos need something like 2500 qubits or so; and by that I mean generally useful programmable qubits. To show a bit over 100 qubits with stability, meaning the information survives a while, long enough to be read, and general enough to run some benchmarks on is something many people thought might never come.There\u2019s a sort of religious reaction people have to quantum computing: it breaks so many things that I think a lot of people just like to assume it won\u2019t happen: too much in computing and data security will change -> let\u2019s not worry about it.Combined with the slow pace of physical research progress (Schorrs algorithm for quantum factoring was mid 90s), and snake oil sales companies, it\u2019s easy to ignore.Anyway seems like the clock might be ticking; AI and data security will be unalterably different if so. Worth spending a little time doing some long tail strategizing I\u2019d say.\n \nreply",
      "You need to distinguish between \"physical qubits\" and \"logical qubits.\" This paper creates a single \"first-of-a-kind\" logical qubit with about 100 physical qubits (using Surface Code quantum error correction). A paper from Google in 2019 estimates needing ~20 million physical qubits (\"How to factor 2048 bit RSA integers in 8 hours using 20 million noisy qubits\" - https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749), though recent advances probably brought this number down a bit. That's because to run Shor's algorithm at a useful scale, you need a few thousand very high quality logical qubits.So despite this significant progress, it's probably a still a while until RSA is put out of the job. That being said, quantum computers would be able to retroactively break any public keys that were stored, so there's a case to be made for switching to quantum-resistant cryptography (like lattice-based cryptography) sooner rather than later.\n \nreply",
      "Thank you for the explanation. It's still an upwards update on the qubit timelines of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05045 (see Fig. 7), but not by an insane amount. We've realized their 95% expectation of qubit progress (1 logical qubit) for 2026, in 2024.92 instead.Which to be clear is quite a bit faster than expected in 2020, but still within the realm of plausible stuff.\n \nreply",
      "> quantum computers would be able to retroactively break any public keys that were storedUse a key exchange that offers perfect forward secrecy (e.g. diffie Hellman) and you don\u2019t need to worry about your RSA private key eventually being discovered.\n \nreply",

      "Perfect forward secrecy doesn't work that well when NSA motto is - store everything now decrypt later. If they intercept the ephemeral key exchange now they can decrypt the message 10 or 50 years later.\n \nreply",
      "This is correct. I worked in quantum research a little.\n \nreply",
      "The required number of qubits to execute Shor\u2019s algorithm is way larger than 2500 qubits as the error ceiling for logical qubits must decrease exponentially with every logical qubit added to produce meaningful results. Hence, repeated applications of error correction or an increase in the surface code would be required. That would significantly blow up the number of physical qubits needed.\n \nreply",
      "He\u2019s quoting the number of logical qubits (which is 1024 IIRC, not 2500), after error correction.ETA: Wikipedia 2330 qubits, but I'm not sure it is citing the most recent work: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography#ci...\n \nreply",
      "I actually thought the number of logical qubits needed was around 20 for factorisation as the state space size is 2^(2^n) and hence did not recognise them as the number of logical qubits required. It is often misunderstood that error correction needs to be done only once, as with classical quantum computers, and the numbers would fit together with one pass of error correction.The Shor's algorithm requires binary encoding; hence, 2048 logical qubits are needed to become a nuance for cryptography. This, in turn, means that one will always be easily able to run away from a quantum adversary by paying a polynomial price on group element computations, whereas a classical adversary is exponentially bounded in computation time, and a quantum adversary is exponentially bounded with a number of physical qubits. Fascinating...\n \nreply"

      "That's a solid writeup on the history of external DMA attacks!  Very nicely done, and well worth a read.This sort of thing is why QubesOS tends to put hardware controllers in isolated VMs and only pass access through.  With a working IOMMU (any modern hardware has this), all you can get is DMA access into a VM that doesn't actually have much of interest in it, and no access into other VMs...//EDIT: Though at a closer read, there's some that... isn't quite right, in how terms and examples are done.  I'd expect better from someone doing low level security work - INB copies to a general purpose register, not a memory address, a DMA controller is a \"discrete\" bit of hardware, it's not very \"discreet,\" etc.  I'm not sure.  This is starting to feel very AI-assisted to me.  The overall concepts are fine, but a lot of the background section doesn't read reasonably, or goes off into weird weeds and... never explores them.  The Intel Xeon is not a less exotic example of a DMA controller.  The PC/AT platform did not have a PCI bus.Eh.  I remain convinced it's a decent enough overview of the matter, but a lot of the details just read really weird to me in the background sections.

      "Yeah, there were a few words early on that struck me as \"This is a non-native English speaker\" sort of translation issues, which don't bother me in technical writing like this.  But when they started doing INB/OUTB examples as memory addressed instructions, vs copying into a register... I get the point being made, but also, that's not a translation error.  Don't use the \"This is an actual instruction\" font if you're not quoting actual instructions that exist on the hardware.  \"inb 0x8, 0xFF\" is not a valid x86 instruction, not even close.Anyway, I'd also like to see some of their source, or hardware diagrams, but... it'll come out eventually, I suppose.Proper IOMMU configuration and assigning anything with DMA to a disposable service VM still solves a lot, though at least these attacks require physical access.  So far.  I'm sure someone, at some point, will release a SD Express card with awful enough firmware that you can pivot through it for a software-only attack on this sort of system.\n \nreply",
      "Thank you for noticing (and reading at all).

      "For languages like go and rust there's not a lot of added benefits. For C++ tho it's much easier in my opinion. You can also manage dependencies through it.\n \nreply",
      "Bazel does a lot of non-obvious things that other build tools don't, that become important in larger codebases (100-10,000 active developers):- Automatic caching of everything.\nIn most build tools, caching is opt in, so the core build/compile steps usually end up getting cached but everything else is not and ends up being wastefully recomputed all the time. In Bazel, caching is the default so everything is cached. Even tests are cached so if you run a test twice on the same code and inputs (transitively), the second time it is skipped- Dependency based test selection: You can use bazel query to determine the possible targets and tests affected by a code change, allowing you to trivially set up CI to only run tests downstream of a PR diff and skip unrelated ones. Any large codebase that doesn't use Bazel ends up re-inventing this manually, e.g. consider this code in apache/spark that re-implements this in a Python script that wraps `mvn` or `sbt` (which are build tools that do not provide this functionality) https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/290b4b31bae2e02b648d2c5...- Automatic sandboxing of your build steps in CGroup/NS containers, to ensure your build steps do not make use of un-declared files. In most build tools, this kind of mistake results in confusing nondeterministic parallelism and cache invalidation problems down the road, where e.g. your build step may rely on a file on disk but not realize it needs to re-compute when the file changes. In Bazel, these mis-configurations result in a deterministic error up front- At my last job we extended these cgroups to limit CPU/Memory usage as well, which eliminates the noisy neighbour problem and ensures a build step or test gets the same compute footprint whether run alone during development or 96x parallel on a CI worker (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/21322). Otherwise it's common for tests to pass when run during manual development then timeout or OOM when run in CI under resource pressure due to other tests hogging the CPU or RAM- Built in support for seamless shared caches: e.g. I compile something on my laptop, you download it to your laptop for usage. This also applies to tests: e.g. if TestFoo was run in CI on master, if i pull master and run all tests without changing the Foo code, TestFoo is skipped and uses the CI result- Built in support for shared compute clusters: e.g. I compile stuff and it automatically happens in the cloud on 96 core machines, or i run a lot of tests (e.g. after a big refactor) on my laptop and it automatically gets farmed out to run 1024x parallel on the cluster (which despite running faster shouldn't cost any more than running 1x parallel, since it costs 1024x as much per-second but should finish in 1024x fewer seconds!)- Support for deep integration between multiple languages: e.g. building a Go binary and Rust library which are both used in a Python executable, which is then tested using a Bash script and deployed as part of a Java backend server. Most build tools support one language well and others not at all, Bazel supports them all (not perfect but adequately)If you never hit these needs, you don't need Bazel, and you probably shouldn't use it because it is ferociously complicated. But if you do hit these needs, most other build tools simply do not cut it at all.We're trying to support some of these use cases and provide a simpler alternative in https://mill-build.org, but Bazel really is a high bar to reach in terms of features that support large monorepos\n \nreply",
      "Woah!! You say \"If you never hit these needs, you don't need Bazel\", but even for a small-ish project, I would like to have Automatic caching of everything, Dependency based test selection, Automatic sandboxing of build steps, or seamless shared caches!I guess for a small team (say less than 10 people) the complexity of Bazel is too much to make it worth it, but those features you mention seem like universally useful for any project. I bet there are lots and lots of reinvented wheels out there trying to do just a subset of all these.\n \nreply"

      "A vulnerability not mentioned in the article is the normalisation of executing code that has been especially targeted to a specific user or specific device with no validation of reproducibility and no ability for anyone to verify this custom build and download service hasn't been generating backdoored builds.One should want to ensure use of the same build of xz-utils that Andres Freund is using, or at least a build of xz-utils that other security researchers can later obtain to figure out whether supply chain implants are present in open source software[1].There's a write up at Mozilla[2] from years ago describing an abandoned attempt by Mozilla to ensure their release builds are publicly logged in a Merkle tree. Google has written up their implementation for Pixel firmware builds but apps delivered through the Google Play Store seem to be vulnerable (unless there is another log I have been unable to find).[3] Apple is seemingly worse than Google on binary transparency with Apple's firmware and app distribution system targeting builds to individual devices with no transparency of builds.For an example of binary transparency done well, Gentoo's ebuild repository (being a single Git repository/Merkle tree containing source checksums) possibly remains the largest and most distributed Merkle trees of open source software.[1] Post xz-utils backdoor, some researchers (including some posting to oss-security about their efforts) undertook automated/semi-automated scans of open source software builds to check for unexplained high entropy files which could contain hidden malicious code. This is not possible to achieve with customised per-user/per-device builds unless every single build is made publicly available for later analysis and a public log (Merkle tree) accompanies those published builds.[2] https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Binary_Transparency[3] https://developers.google.com/android/binary_transparency/ov...\n \nreply",
