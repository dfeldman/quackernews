      "I read through several of the top level pages, then SQLite, but still had no idea what was meant by \"context\" as it's a highly ambiguous word and is never mentioned with any concrete definition, example, or scope of capability that it is meant to imply.After reading the Python server tutorial, it looks like there is some tool calling going on, in the old terminology. That makes more sense. But none of the examples seem to indicate what the protocol is, whether it's a RAG sort of thing, do I need to prompt, etc.It would be nice to provide a bit more concrete info about capabilities and what the purposes is before getting into call diagrams. What do the arrows represent? That's more important to know than the order that a host talks to a server talks to a remote resource.I think this is something that I really want and want to build a server for, but it's unclear to me how much more time I will have to invest before getting the basic information about it!\n \nreply",
      "Thank you. That\u2019s good feedback.The gist of it is: you have an llm application such as Claude desktop. You want to have it interact (read or write) with some system you have. MCP solves this.For example you can give the application the database schema as a \u201cresource\u201d, effectively saying; here is a bunch of text, do whatever you want with it during my chat with the llm. Or you can give the application a tool such as query my database. Now the model itself can decide when it wants to query (usually because you said: hey tell me what\u2019s in the accounts table or something similar).It\u2019s \u201cbring the things you care about\u201d to any llm application with an mcp client\n \nreply",
      "Or, in short: it's (an attempt to create) a standard protocol to plug tools to LLM app via the good ol' tools/function calling mechanism.It's not introducing new capabilities, just solving the NxM problem, hopefully leading to more tools being written.(At least that's how I understand this. Am I far off?)\n \nreply",
      "Here are a couple points of confusion for me:1. The sampling documentation is confusing. \"Sampling\" means something very specific in statistics, and I'm struggling to see any connection between the term's typical usage and the usage here. Perhaps \"prompt delegation\" would be a more obvious term to use.Another thing that's confusing about the sampling concept is that it's initiated by a server instead of a client, a reversal of how client/server interactions normally work. Without concrete examples, it's not obvious why or how a server might trigger such an exchange.2. Some information on how resources are used would be helpful. How do resources get pulled into the context for queries? How are clients supposed to determine which resources are relevant? If the intention is that clients are to use resource descriptions to determine which to integrate into prompts, then that purpose should be more explicit.Perhaps a bigger problem is that I don't see how clients are to take a resource's content into account when analyzing its relevance. Is this framework intentionally moving away from the practice of comparing content and query embeddings? Or is this expected to be done by indices maintained on the client?\n \nreply",
      "I just want to say kudos for the design of the protocol. Seems inspired by https://langserver.org/ in all the right ways. Reading through it is a delight, there's so many tasteful little decisions.One bit of constructive feedback: the TypeScript API isn't using the TypeScript type system to its fullest. For example, for tool providers, you could infer the type of a tool request handler's params from the json schema of the corresponding tool's input schema.I guess that would be assuming that the model is doing constrained sampling correctly, such that it would never generate JSON that does not match the schema, which you might not want to bake into the reference server impl. It'd mean changes to the API too, since you'd need to connect the tool declaration and the request handler for that tool in order to connect their types.\n \nreply",
      "This is a great idea! There's also the matter of requests' result types not being automatically inferred in the SDK right now, which would be great to fix.Could I convince you to submit a PR? We'd love to include community contributions!\n \nreply",
      "If you were willing to bring additional zod tooling or move to something like TypeBox (https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox), the json schema would be a direct derivation of the tools' input schemas in code.\n \nreply"

      "That's a reasonable basic overview.I'm surprised that rotating scanners are still used. It's been twenty years since Velodyne built their first one. They work OK, but cost too much. I was expecting flash LIDAR or MEMS mirrors to take over. Continental, the auto parts company, bought the leading flash LIDAR company over a decade ago, but the volume market a big parts company needs never appeared.Waymo is still using rotating LIDARs even for the little ones at the vehicle corners. Those need less range. There needs to be a cheap, flush-mounted replacement for those things. The location is too vulnerable. Maybe millimeter phased array radar mounted behind Fiberglas body panels.\nWaymo needs to solve that problem before they do New York.The LIDAR on top may not be a problem. Insisting that it has to go away to \"look like a car\" is like insisting that cars had to have the form factor of horse-propelled buggies. Early cars looked like buggies, but that didn't last.One big advantage of pulsed LIDAR over continuous is that the interference problem between identical units is much less. The duty cycle is tiny. Data from one pulse round trip is collected in less than a microsecond. Just put some randomization in the pulse timing and getting multiple conflicts in a row goes away.\n \nreply",
      "The SNR for flash Lidar is really low because you spread the beam out over such a large area.Most automotive Lidar already operate in a \u201cphoton starved regime\u201d, ~200-300 photons per return. If you spread that over the entire scene, your snr drops quickly.This forces you into 1550nm, and a large detector array and high power laser at 1550nm is extremely expensive. https://www.hamamatsu.com/content/dam/hamamatsu-photonics/si...\n \nreply",
      "Waymo have in house radar, I think in the 70GHz gap in the absorption spectrum. They're pretty obvious as sort of paperback book sized planes, mounted near other sensors IIRC.The old Velodyne units were actually susceptible to damage if you left two units running right next to each other. I did hear a proposal at some point for a different but similar unit to use GPS time to sync the rotations of all the units we had live so they wouldn't be pointed at each other, but in practice it seemed to not be a huge issue.BTW I once gave you guff about continuing to bring up Conti's flash LIDAR, and in retrospect I wish I hadn't, I really enjoy your contributions here.\n \nreply",
      "> They work OK, but cost too much.Costs have dropped dramatically in the past 20 years and continue to do so.> There needs to be a cheap, flush-mounted replacement for those things.Why? Corners are the optimal mounting position for maximum visibility. It allows the car to -in-effect- see around corners in ways no centrally mounted sensor can.> Waymo needs to solve that problem before they do New York.What? Because of vandalism?\n \nreply",
      "Have you ever seen the corners of a car that has been parked in a big East-coast city? They will sustain damage during the course of normal operation and storage, and many people will not stop and leave their insurance information, especially if the damage is perceived as minor and happens while the car is parked and the owner not present. Currently, the corners of a car are relatively non-critical to its function and usually not too expensive to repair. If both of those change, we'll see more expensive damage that is more challenging to repair as well as less likely to be handled by the responsible party.Also, having the sensors stick out from the corners makes the car's collision box and turning radius bigger. That doesn't help in any tight situation, but I imagine that's not that different between e.g. SF and New York. What is different is the sheer volume of cars and pedestrian activity.\n \nreply",
      "They don't stick out that much. The geely vehicle has front sensors recessed just above the front wheel well, without much additional side clearance. Either way, a collision involves regulatory filings, downtime, and sensor recalibration even if no damage is sustained.\n \nreply",
      "Waymos sometimes stop briefly in parking spots while waiting for assignments, but they don't really park as such except in special lots.  The big problem I have seen is they tend not to always pull to the curb when releasing passengers and if a door is left even slightly ajar then they will sit there requesting the door be closed even if they are blocking a lane with many cars behind them beeping.\n \nreply",
      "Here's an interesting \"lidar gem\" from Hacker News a few years ago:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33554679Lidar obstacle detection algorithm from a Git repo leaked onto TorThis is a drivable region mapping (obstacle detection) algorithm found in what appears to be a git repo leaked from an autonomous vehicle company in 2017. The repo was available through one or more Tor hidden services for several years.The lidar code appears to be written for the Velodyne HDL-32E. It operates in a series of stages, each stage refining the output of the previous stage. This algorithm is in the second stage. It is the primary obstacle detection method, with the other methods making only small improvements.The leaked code uses a column-major matrix of points and it explicitly handles NaNs (the no-return points). We've rewritten it to use a much more cache-efficient row-major matrix layout and a conditional that will ignore the NaN points without explicit testing.This is an amazingly effective method of obstacle detection, considering its simplicity.\n \nreply",

This could be done with a minimum of network traffic if instead of streaming the bytes to a central server to hash, the hash state is forwarded from block server to block server in sequence.

      "I haven't encountered this pattern before.  Is there some more information on what problems this is designed to solve?\n \nreply",
      "The problem most programmers would be familiar with is making an update inside a deeply nested immutable data structure. For example, suppose you want to update a user's billing address, and you have an immutable data structure that looks like this:    user { billingInfo: { card, address }, name, subscription { level, expiration }, status { level, since } }\n\nThe structure is immutable, so you can't make the update in place. On the other hand, you're only changing one field, so it would be wasteful to make a complete deep copy. The efficient way to create an updated instance is to create a new user instance and a new billingInfo instance while reusing the name, subscription, and status instances.You can think of this as the equivalent of a setter for immutable data structures.This is an artificial example, because the cost of making a deep copy of this user structure is probably not that bad, and the boilerplate to make an efficient update is not all that bad, either. You would use an optics library when 1) you need efficient updates and 2) it's worth investing a little effort to hide the boilerplate.Optics also let you concisely express access into a deeply nested structure, the getter paired with the setter. In my experience, updates are the motivation for setting up optics, and concise access is a nice thing you get as a bonus.\n \nreply",
      "Does it offer creating a mutable view on top of the immutable structure that can be used to accumulate a whole set of changes to later be materialized into a copy with the changes? (or to be used directly, at whatever cost would be required) That's something I've been wondering why it's not more of an established thing.

It reminds me of the Atari 2600 emulators in Minecraft [1], or things like using bitwise operators to compute and write arbitrary data to memory as is done in the Pegasus/NSO exploit [2]. But I think the literature does not necessarily imply that these \"weird machines\" are Turing complete or capable of much; they are more general. From my understanding weird machines are some sort of FSM of unintended/weird states in a program with various transitions to go from weird state to weird state. The use is to be able to construct a weird machine with enough states and transitions to get a program to a vulnerable state where it can be exploited. Getting something like this with micro-architectural weird machines, the Pegasus exploit, etc. is of course much harder, and more valuable. It will also be interesting to see if the theory behind weird machines becomes used for automated exploit generation in the future.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq7T5_xH24M[2] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-i...\n \nreply",

This could be accomplished with a strict memory management jointly at the OS layer and the binary structure of the application\u2026 one where the binary has a well defined memory memory boundary. The OS just ensures it is kept with in these limits.\n \nreply",
      "> well defined deterministic execution model would mitigate some of these unpredictable state transitions.The problem here is that giving a program access to high-resolution (non-virtualized) timers violates deterministic execution.

Add some wait/err groups to this and we'll get a lot of boilerplate repeated all over the place. I viewed this as \"channel transformations\" and wanted to abstract it away. When generics came out it became technically possible.Surprisingly, part of my inspiration came from scala (which I haven't touched since 2014). Back then Scala had transformable streams and the \"Try\" typethen.\n \nreply",
      "The channel-focused approach to stream processing reminds me of Heka [0]. It was a contemporary of Samza and Heron, and it was fairly prominent in the early Go ecosystem (maybe 10 years ago). As I recall it, quite foggily and quite a long while later, one of the final nails in Heka's coffin was that channel throughput didn't scale well. Do you have benchmarks for Rill, or is it not intended for high-throughput use cases?[0]: https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka\n \nreply",
      "I have some benchmarks in the project's wiki on Github. I can confirm your point: Rill's main bottleneck is channel operations, the library itself adds negligible overhead on top. Of course, for multi-stage pipelines the number of channel operations grows.To summarize, I believe Rill's performance would be fine for any problem solvable with Go channels. I've used it for a wide variety of use cases - while I'm not sure I can call them high-throughput, I've had pipelines transferring hundreds of GBs of data with no performance issues.\n \nreply",
      "Is there an underlying assumption that the channels are containers and not streams?\n \nreply",
      "No, it's the opposite - the library treats channels as streams, processing items as they arrive without needing to know the total size in advance. This is why it can handle infinite streams and large datasets that don't fit in memory.\n \nreply",
      "Very intuitive API. Thanks!\n \nreply",
      "Looks good, similar to https://github.com/sourcegraph/conc which we've been using for a while. Will give this a look.\n \nreply",

      "What you may be missing is that in the US starting around 1950s, suburbanization inverted this millennia-old globally-generalized pattern. It was called \"white flight\" [1] at the time, because richer mostly white workers moved their tax revenues out of the city limits. Because so much infrastructure and social structure (like schools) was funded largely or even entirely from the local tax revenue, it hollowed out the \"inner cities\" and the feedback loops were devastating. That's why New York City became the murder capital of the world in the 1970s. Colloquially, in the US, \"inner city\" [2] came to mean a low-income and mostly minority neighborhood full of crime, not anything specific to its geographic location.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_city\n \nreply",

      "I compile a lot of C++ code from a lot of places, and the only time I run into code that somehow simply doesn't work on newer versions of C++ and where the developers aren't even sure if they will accept any patches to fix the issue as they claim it \"isn't supported\" to use a newer version of C++--even for the public headers of a library--is, you guessed it: code from Google.Meanwhile, most of the C++ code from Google seems to be written in some mishmash of different ideas, always at some halfway point along a migration between something ancient and something passable... but never anything I would ever dare to call \"modern\", and thereby tends to be riddled with state machines and manual weak pointers that lead to memory corruption.So... I really am not sure I buy the entire premise of this article? Honestly, I am extremely glad that Google is finally leaving the ecosystem, as I generally do not enjoy it when Google engineers try to force their ridiculous use cases down peoples' throats, as they seem to believe they simply know better than everyone else how to develop software.Like... I honestly feel bad for the Rust people, as I do not think the increasing attention they are going to get from Google is going to be at all positive for that ecosystem, any more than I think the massive pressure Google has exerted on the web has been positive or any more than the pressure Google even exerted on Python was positive (not that Python caved to much of it, but the pressure was on and the fact that Python refused to play ball with Google was in no small part what caused Go to exist at all).(FWIW, I do miss Microsoft's being in the space, but they honestly left years ago -- Herb's existence until recent being kind of a token consideration -- as they have been trying to figure out a tactical exit to C++ ever since Visual J++ and, arguably, Visual Basic, having largely managed to pivot to C# and TypeScript for SDKs long ago. That said... Sun kicking Microsoft out of Java might have been really smart, despite the ramifications?)\n \nreply",
      "> code from Google.I spilled my coffee, I was just talking the other day to some coworkers how I don't trust google open source.

I feel a lot of this sentiment extends to GCP as well.So many google projects are better than your average community one, but they never gain traction outside of google because it is just too damn hard to use them outside of google infra.The only Google project that seems to evade this rule that I know of is Go.\n \nreply",
      ">  but they don't give a damn about contributionsHere is a concrete reason why Google open source sucks when it comes to contributions and I don't think it can be improved unless Google changes things drastically: (1) an external contributor makes a nice change and a PR on GitHub; (2) the change breaks internal use cases and their tests; (3) the team is unwilling to fix the PR or port the internal test (which may be a test several layers down the dependency tree) to open source.> making it easy for you to use the projectsGoogle internally use Blaze, a version of Bazel. It's so ridiculously easy for one team to use another team's project that even just thinking about what the rest of us needs to do to use another project is unloved dreadful work.
