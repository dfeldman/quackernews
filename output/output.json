      "> infinite perimeterI don\u2019t follow, how/why?reply",
      "The discussion is about triangles in hyperbolic space. In hyperbolic space, if you keep extending a triangle's lines out by moving the intersection farther away, you'll tend toward a triangle with a constant area (pi in the article because the curve was chosen for that, you can have any arbitrary finite value you want by varying the curvature) even though the perimeter keeps going up.If that sounds like so much technobabble, that's because this article assumed what I think is a very specific level of knowledge about hyperbolic space, as it doesn't explain what it is, yet this is one of the very first things you'll ever learn about it. So it has a rather small target audience of people who know what hyperbolic space is but didn't know that fact about triangles. If you'd like to catch up with what hyperbolic space is, YouTube has a lot of good videos about it: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hyperbolic+spac... And as is often the case with geometry, videos can be a legitimate benefit that is well taken advantage of and not just a \"my attention span has been destroyed by TikTok\" accomodation.Including CodeParade's explanations, which are notable in that he made a video game (Hyperbolica) in which you can even walk around in it if you want, with an option for doing it in VR (though that is perhaps the weirdest VR experience I had... I didn't get motion sick per se, but my brain still objected in a very unique manner and I couldn't do it for very long). It's been out and on Steam for a while now, so you can run through the series where he is talking about the game he is in the process of creating at the time and go straight to trying it out, if you want.reply",
      "It must be that the figure with the half circles is just a representation of the hyperbolic space into 2D.  Such projections are not faithful; you cannot take measurements in the projection and take them literally.We can make an analogy to cartography: you can't trust areas and distances on distorted projections like Mercator.Look, even the angles don't look to be zero in that diagram. We have to imagine that we zoom in on an infinitesimal zone around each corner to see the almost zero angle; i.e. the circle tangent lines actually go almost parallel. So to speak.Thus the angles are locally correct, since they are measurable on arbitrarily small scales and can easily be imagined to be even when glancing at the entire figure. But distances between the points aren't localizable; they have to follow a measure which somehow correctly spans the abstract hyperbolic space that they represent.How about this (almost certainly incorrect) imagining: pretend that the real line shown, on which the three points lie, is actually a horizon line, which lies in a vast distance (out at infinity). Just like the horizon when you do drawings with two-point perspective. Imagine the three points are vanishing points on the horizon.  Vanishing points are not actually points; they just directions into infinity.if, in a two-point perspective, you draw a curve whose endpoints are tangent to two vanishing point traces, that curve is infinitely long.For instance if you draw an intersection between two infinite roads, where the curb has a round corner, you will get some kind of smiley curve joining two vanishing points. That curve is understood to be infinitely long.reply",
      "Let's go to to the normal infinite plane for a moment.You can use a map that is  inside a circle with r=1. The objects get deformed, but points have a 1 to 1 correspondence. Lines that pass though 0 look straight, but other lines are curved.Measuring a distance is hard, you have to use some weird rules.If you draw a segment of length 0.001 segment in the circular map, it has almost the same length in the real infinite map.If you draw a segment of length 0.001 segment near the border of the circular map, it's a huge thing in the infinite map.Moreover, a line that pass thorough 0 has apparent length 2 in the map, but represent an infinite length  in the planeNote that the border of the circle is outside the plane.---The reverse happen if you have a map of the Earth. You can draw on the map with a pencil a long segment near the pole, but it represents a small curved segment in the Earth.---Back to your question ,,,It's on the hyperbolic plane, not in the usual euclidean plane. So the map is only the top half, and the horizontal line = axis x is outside, it's the border.Length are weird, and a 0.001 segment draw with a pencil on the map far away from the x axis is small in the actual hyperbolic plane, but a 0.001 segment draw with a pencil on the map near the x axis is very long in the actual hyperbolic plane.The circles \"touch\" the x axis. In spite they look short when you draw them with a pencil, they part that is close to the x axis has a huge length in the hyperbolic plane.reply",
      "Hyperbolic geometry! Note how lines on the chart don't appear straight. That's because this is just a projection of an infinite hyperbolic space. The rules of this projection move points at infinity to the real line, and straight lines to circles. That means each of the points on the mentioned triangle is infinitely far away in some direction.reply",
      "As far as I understand, the closer the points are to the line, the more distant they get to the rest of the plane. That's why he says that \"this is an improper triangle\", as the point of intersections of the hyperbolic lines are theoretically at an infinite distance from the \"origin\", and thus that the lines connecting those points have an infinite length.reply",
      "The disk model of hyberolic geometry is made to map hyperbolic 2 space (which is infinite in area) into the finite interior of the disk. In order to capture this, the normal euclidean notion of distance is distorted by a function which allows \"distances\" to go to infinity as a curve approaches the boundary of the disk.reply"

      "Cool, I tried something similar 30 years ago working for a military contractor:http://zoom.interoscitor.com/PetersonEnterprises/Consulting/...I was asked to come up with a 3D display of the airspace around an aircraft for the pilot to use and which could replace the 2D displays used then.  People were impressed, but decided it was impractical for a variety of reasons.  You can't really tell where the aircraft are relative to each other and the ground without rotating the display (which means the pilot loses their orientation), and there are no altitude indicators and it's difficult to tell where each aircraft is relative to the others.  (Which is why I added the vertical lines and ground tracks.)  Also things get visually messy when several aircraft are close together, even if you use different colors (which doesn't work for the colorblind).  For example, could you use this display to tell if a collision is imminent near ground level in proximity to an airport?  The display does give you a high level sense of what is going on in the airspace; it may not have enough details to be of practical use to pilots and air traffic controllers.  I'd suggest consulting with them to get feedback.  Maybe this would be practical as a VR display?  How did they solve this in the F-35 helmet display?reply",
      "Cool project.I noticed one minor area for potential improvement: when I look at the ATL area right now, it looks like aircraft are clipping through the ground at takeoff and landing.I'm guessing this is because you're taking the pressure altitude which is derived from aircraft transponder data, and incorrectly interpreting it as altitude above sea level, without correcting for local air pressure variations. Right now, local barometric pressure in Atlanta is about 1028 mbar, which means pressure altitude is about 450 feet lower than true MSL altitude.(Pilots need to know their altitude relative to sea level and the ground, so they have to manually adjust their altimeters to correct for pressure variations, based on the latest local weather conditions. For ATC, it's more critical to know aircraft's altitudes relative to each other. So transponders report the pressure altitude without correction, to guarantee that inconsistent pressure corrections can't cause errors.)reply",

      "The idea is that if you're winning you can just do a binary search, but if you're losing, it's better to take some risks by making narrower guesses.For example, let's say it's the last turn and your opponent is about to win. Say you may have 2 options but your opponent has 4 options. Instead of whittling it down to 2 options, it's better to guess one of the four. How outrageous should your guesses be is the content of the result and paper.Paper is on archive (and linked from the video):https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03327reply",
      "I find it somewhat surprising that the optimal play when you're ahead is still just binary search. Is there an intuitive reason why it's not productive to make riskier guesses? Why not use my lead to have some chance of sealing my victory immediately, while still maintaining my lead if I'm wrong?reply",
      "An entropy argument for optimal strategy when winning? Finite size/bounds arguments for losing?If you have 100 options available to you, the maximum information gain is if you eliminate half. So, if you can, you always want to employ that strategy.The problem comes with when you're losing, you might get maximum entropy gain by eliminating half but, because of finite effects of the game ending, that might not matter.Take the example I gave: the next move you lose and you have 4 options to choose from. Eliminating half (2 in this case) will give you maximum entropy gain but guarantee a loss, since you're not whittling down the remaining list to 1 option. Better to take the hit on entropy in order to at least have a chance at winning.I don't claim to have deep knowledge but this seems like finite size scaling effects. There's a kind of \"continuum limit\" of these processes but when you get to actual real-world/finite instances, there are issues \"at the edges\", where the continuum becomes finite. The finite size of the problems creates a kind of non-linear issue at the edges. All this is very hand-waivy, so don't take it too seriously but that's the intuition I have, at least.reply",
      "Binary search minimizes the number of expected moves until you find the target. If you are already ahead, this is a natural thing to want to do. The reason why this doesn't work when you're behind is that your opponent can also do that and probabilistically maintain their lead.reply",
      "If you're behind and you're doing the same strategy as your opponent, you'll never catch up. If you're behind doing the risky bet strategy, most times you will never catch up either because your risky bets don't pay off, but a few times they will pay off.reply"

      "I\u2019ve had a ton of success with frontier coding agents. My approach is dead simple.- Use a single agent. Don\u2019t bother with anything other than one of the best. Right now, I\u2019m using Codex-Max with \u201cextra high\u201d reasoning only.- Give it one task at a time. Give it tasks that take the agent maybe 10-20m to complete, no more.- Manually review. For edits / fixes / tweaks, either do it yourself or use the agent again, but understand that sometimes the agent will just make the same mistake twice or introduce a second bug when fixing the first. Don\u2019t try to address this with more agents. Just use your own engineering skill and knowledge!That\u2019s it. I\u2019m personally phenomenally productive with this approach. I personally have absolutely no idea how to use (or why I would even bother using) complex multi-agent setups, and I\u2019d never try to get an agent to run for 24+ hours because I\u2019d have no idea how to review or tweak its output. This approach gives me batches of work I can actually understand and work on if I need to.reply",
      "One of the things that makes it very difficult to have reasonable conversations about what you can do with LLMs is the effort-to-outcome curve is basically exponential - with almost no effort, you can get 70% of the way there. This looks amazing, and so people (mostly executives) look at this and think, \u201cthis changes everything!\u201dThe problem is the remaining 30% - the next 10-20% starts to require things like multi-agent judge setups, external memory, context management, and that gets you to something that\u2019s probably working but you sure shouldn\u2019t ship to production. As to the last 10% - I\u2019ve seen agentic workflows with hundreds of different agents, multiple models, and fantastically complex evaluation frameworks to try to reduce the error rates past the ~10% mark. By a certain point, the amount of infrastructure and LLM calls are running into several hundred dollars per run, and you\u2019re still not getting guaranteed reliable output.If you know what you\u2019re doing and you know where to fit the LLMs (they\u2019re genuinely the best system we\u2019ve ever devised for interpreting and categorizing unstructured human input), they can be immensely useful, but they sing a siren song of simplicity that will lure you to your doom if you believe it.reply",
      "Yes, it's essentially the Pareto principle [0]. The LLM community has conflated the 80% as difficult complicated work, when it was essentially boilerplate. Allegedly LLMs have saved us from that drudgery, but I personally have found that (without the complicated setups you mention) the 80% done project that gets one shot is in reality more like 50% done because it is built on an unstable foundation, and that final 20% involves a lot of complicated reworking of the code.  There's still plenty of value but I think it is less than proponents would want you to believe.Anecdotally, I have found that even if you type out paragraph after paragraph describing everything you need the agent to take care of, it eventually feels like you could have written a lot of the code yourself with the help of a good IDE by the time you can finally send your prompt off.- [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principlereply",
      "Yeah, my mental model at this point is there\u2019s two components to building a system: writing the code and understanding the system. When you\u2019re the one writing the code, you get the understanding at the same time. When you\u2019re not, you still need to put in that work to deeply grok the system. You can do it ahead of time while writing the prompts, you can do it while reviewing the code, you can do it while writing the test suite, or you can do it when the system is on fire during an outage, but the work to understand the system can\u2019t be outsourced to the LLM.reply",
      "Just for getting a frame of reference, how many people were involved over how much time building a workflow with hundreds of agents?reply",
      "I\u2019ve seen a couple solo efforts and a couple teams, but usually a few months. It tends to evolve as a kind of whack-a-mole situation - \u201cwe solved that failure case/hallucination, now we\u2019re getting this one.\u201dreply",
      "\u2026it really feels like they\u2019re attempting to reinvent a project tracker and starting off from scratch in thinking about it.It feels like they\u2019re a few versions behind what I\u2019m doing, which is\u2026 odd.Self-hosting a plane.io instance. Added a plane MCP tool to my codex. Added workflow instructions into Agents.md which cover standards, documentation, related work, labels, branch names, adding of comments before plan, after plan, at varying steps of implementation, summary before moving ticket to done. Creating new tickers and being able to relate to current or others, etc\u2026It ain\u2019t that hard.  Just do inception (high to mid level details) create epics and tasks. Add personas, details, notes, acceptance criteria and more. Can add comments yourself to update. Whatever.Slice tickets thin and then go wild. Add tickets as your working though things. Make modifications.Why so difficult?reply",
      "This was my take.They\u2019ve made an issue tracker out of json files and a text file.Why not hook an mcp to an actual issue tracker?reply",
      "Used an LLM to help write the following up as I\u2019m still pretty scattered about the idea and on mobile.\u2014\u2014Something I\u2019ve been going over in my head:I used to work in a pretty strict Pivotal XP shop. PM ran the team like a conductor. We had analysts, QA, leads, seniors. Inceptions for new features were long, sometimes heated sessions with PM + Analyst + QA + Lead + a couple of seniors. Out of that you\u2019d get:- Thinly sliced epics and tasks\n- Clear ownership\n- Everyone aligned on data flows and boundaries\n- Specs, requirements, and acceptance criteria nailed at both high- and mid-levelAt the end, everyone knew what was talking to what, what \u201cdone\u201d meant, and where the edges were.What I\u2019m thinking about now is basically that process, but agentized and wired into the tooling:- Any ticket is an entry point into a graph, not just a blob of text.\n  - Epics \u2194 tasks \u2194 subtasks\n  - Linked specs / decisions / notes\n  - Files and PRs that touched the same areas- Standards live as versioned docs, not just a random Agents.md:  - Markdown (with diagrams) that declares where it applies: tags, ticket types, modules.\n  - Tickets can pin those docs via labels/tags/links.\n\n- From the agent\u2019s perspective, the UI is just a viewer/editor.\n  - The real surface is an API: \u201cgiven this ticket, type, module, and tags, give me all applicable standards, related work, and code history.\u201d- The agent then plays something like the analyst + senior engineer role:\n  - Pulls in the right standards automatically\n  - Proposes acceptance criteria and subtasks\n  - Explains why a file looks the way it does by walking past tickets / PRs / decisionsSo it\u2019s less \u201cLLM stapled to an issue tracker\u201d and more \u201cthat old XP inception + thin-slice discipline, encoded as a graph the agent can actually reason over.\u201dreply",

      "It took me 50 years, but I\u2019ve finally started watching and rewatching classic and great old sci-fi, fantasy, thrillers, and just good TV like: Space 1999, Blake\u2019s 7, Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, Doctor Who (even Disney+ specials), Jabberwocky, Darkstar (the beach ball- a classic!), Wild Wild West (especially first season), Amazing Stories, The Ray Bradbury Theater (Drew Barrymore was in it!), IT Crowd (the Internet sits atop Big Ben), Black Books (secure door), It Came From Outer Soace, The Magnetic Monster (which actually is about radiation and theoretical \u201cunipolar magnetism\u201d physics which I didn\u2019t know was a real concern then), and others.reply",

      "Part of the appeal of UFO was the music by Barry Gray. Great stuff. The opening montage always grabbed me.And the Moonbase uniforms were very eyecatching to say the least. And some of the plots were almost as mindwarping as The Prisoner.OTOH why did the alien craft always approach the Earth from the side where the Moon is ?reply",
      "\"why did the alien craft always approach the Earth from the side where the Moon is\"Presumably because they'd read the script? :-)reply",

      "I think Space: 1999's greatest achievement was its design. The whole aesthetic, from Alpha's styling to the clothing, is simply gorgeous, and easily surpasses the visuals of many series that followed.That, and the funky theme, of course.reply",
      "I strongly agree.The actual plots of Space1999 were pretty laughable but I don\u2019t think the production design has ever been beaten, even it today\u2019s shows. The sets and vehicles look fully functional, even the clothes look perfectly wearable despite being very 70s. Contrast this with Star Trek, with weird consoles and uniforms that look uncomfortable.The theme is, of course, beyond reproach. I like to imagine the producers couldn\u2019t decide between epic sci-fi chords, funk, and jangly surf guitar so the composer just said screw it and did all three.reply",
      "The first sesason was solid for its time, a sort of twilight zone in space, or even a more fantastical take on Star Trek. It was less about an overarching plot or consistency or being based on a set of strict rules and more about exploring various themes, such as humans in the face of certain death. Nothing groundbreaking but the production and the actors make it work (some of them anyway - sorry, Barbara Bain is about as convincing as a piece of plywood).Dragon's Domain has been living rent-free in my head for over two decades now even if I'm acutely aware how silly is the premise.Second season is plain awful.reply",
      "Long time Space:1999 fan here. I've been thinking about this a lot over the years and I agree with you; the show is best looked at as The Twilight Zone in Space. Well - first season anyway. You REALLY have to pick through the dung of second season to find a few \"well, that bit was alright\" moments.I think the show worked best when it was a review of variations of loneliness.* Dragon's Domain - Tony Cellini is burdened by the loneliness of a demon no one else sees.\n* Guardian of Piri - John Koenig is surrounded by the best of the best in his senior staff. But under the \"spell\" of the Guardian, he has disagree with all of them and make some very lonely decisions.\n* Voyager's Return - Ernst Queller is burdened by the memory of his mistake many years ago with development (and many deaths) of the Queller Drive. And it comes back to haunt him in real life, not just his imagination.\n* End of Eternity - The alien Balor shows us that immortality could be the ultimate form of loneliness.reply"

A lot of this was thanks to Alexander Korda and his brothers, Hungarian directors who came to the UK in the 1930s to make a series of epic influential movies. Korda brought a Hollywood SFX expert, Ned Mann, to the UK; the British Board of Trade insisted that British technicians should be employed and given training. The British artist Walter Percy \"Pop\" Day would then take over Korda's special effects. After world war 2, a new generation of artists maintained the strong effects industry, several trained by Pop Day and Ned Mann. These included Wally Veevers, Tom Howard, Peter Ellenshaw (Day's stepson, who in the 1950s went to the US to work for Disney) and Les Bowie.
