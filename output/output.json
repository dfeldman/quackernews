      "\"I had learned to appreciate the color limitations during the old-school graphics competition at Evoke, where we could only use a predefined color palette. The first time I submitted an entry in 2022, I hated it. The second time, in 2023, I came to accept the limited color palette as a problem to solve. And by 2024, I actually started to enjoy the challenge.\"I've found that limitation in artistic mediums can serve as motivation and even inspiration in art. I primarily work with glitch art; the definition is finicky, and creating it without bleeding into the more generic genre of New Aesthetic can be difficult because of how volatile and uncooperative glitches are. A hard limitation on a number of colors in a palette seems simultaneously incredibly frustrating and liberatingly-simple. While it doesn't inherently affect the medium of the work (pixel art), it poses limitations that challenge it (fidelity in detail being most notable). These limitations also pose some ceiling on the work that can be done - a limited color depth makes an artists focus much more on effective detail than perfect detail, which I think adds character to an art piece.Very interesting article.\n \nreply",
      "> I've found that limitation in artistic mediums can serve as motivation and even inspiration in art.There's a great 1969 interview with Charles Eames in which he discusses design, and constraints as being a necessary component of design.Some Excerpts:Interviewer: Does the creation of Design admit constraint?Eames: Design depends largely on constraints.Interviewer: What constraints?Eames: The sum of all constraints. Here is one of the few effective keys to the design problem: the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible, his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints. The constraints of price, size, strength, balance, time and so forth. Each problem has its own peculiar list.Interviewer: Does Design obey laws?Eames: Aren\u2019t constraints enough?\n \nreply",
      "The article links to the \"no copy?\" site: http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/ which was highly influential in its own time...Demos are ultimately about impressing, also copying without being seen as copying - if you literally copy/paste other people's stuff, that makes you \"lame\", but if you quote/reference it, if you one-up it - if your rivals put out a demo with 200 bobs, you put out one with 240 bobs - then you look cool and people look up to you.I don't think many people would be too concerned that Amiga musicians sampled presets of existing synths before putting those sounds to use in an original composition that fits the Amiga's hardware limits. And they would think it _amazing_ if you could cover a well-known tune with any kind of fidelity in those tight memory limits.I don't think many people are upset if coders reverse-engineer their rivals and they all share among the many hardware tricks you can do - because there's always someone looking to go one step further and is experimenting to find yet another new trick.And finally, graphics artists weren't exactly penalised for re-drawing a Boris Vallejo by hand - it was difficult to do, and \"the scene\" liked those sorts of pictures (i.e. naked chicks and fantasy art).Effectively there was not just \"this is my original art and it's on message\", but also \"I can copy this well-known art, because i'm technically capable enough to do it, and you're not\". And like the generative AI is doing today, or the camera did to paintings... back in the 1990s, scanners and photo editing software lowered the bar so much that even talentless fools could just scan in an image, rather than have the technical skills to reproduce it by hand, taking away what was otherwise a good channel for showing you had talent and others didn't.\n \nreply",
      "It sincerely pleases me to see the Amiga so rightfully discussed in this article. In the 1980s, Amiga was a magical computer years ahead of so many of its peers (including the PC by miles). Sadly, the video capabilities that made it so special eventually became its Achilles heel.\n \nreply",
      "There's something touchingly innocent about Boris Vallejo's work. It is as if he is channeling the fantasies of a 13-year-old boy without shame, guilt or even self-consciousness. It is that rare artwork that is only about itself. It is like a picture that is run through iterative image generation using only the words \"hotter\" and \"heroic\" and \"mysterious\" over and over until an asymptote is reached. It seems pure and innocence in its singular interest, its lack of subtext, if not in its sexual content.\n \nreply",

      "Oh hell yes, I really like the covers in that article you linked.

The \"Pair Programming\" one at the end is good, because there is some sort of vague connection you could make with the image. It's like saying \"by doing how to do this boring and specific thing you're KINDA JUST LIKE THE GUY ON THE COVER TOO SO YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY THIS BOOK\". They say sex sells, but what does it sell?

A kind of subculture somewhere in the locus of the hackersphere where a kind of punk-rock ethos rules the roost.

      "NVIDIA is pretty established but there's also Intel, AMD, Google to contend with. Sure Cerebras is unique in that they make one large chip out of the entire wafer but nothing prevents these other companies from doing the same thing. Currently they are choosing not to because of wafer economics but if they chose to, Cerebras would pretty much lose their advantage. https://www.servethehome.com/cerebras-wse-3-ai-chip-launched... 56x the size of H100 but only 8x the performance improvement isn't something I would brag about. I expected much higher performance since all processing is on one wafer. Something doesn't add up (I'm no system designer). Also, at $3.13 million per node, one could buy 100 H100s at $30k each (not including system, cooling, cluster, etc). Based on price/performance Cerebras loses IMO.\n \nreply",
      "I think the wafer itself isn\u2019t the whole deal. If you watch their videos and read the link you posted the wafer size allows them to stack them in a block with integrated power and cooling at a higher density than blades and attach enormous amounts of memory. Not including the system, cooling, cluster, etc seems like a relatively unfair comparison too given the node includes all of those things - which are very expensive when considering enterprise grade data center hardware.I don\u2019t think their value add is simple \u201csingle wafer\u201d with all other variables the same.

      "Correction: it's 8x the TFLOPS of a DGX (8 H100), not 1 H100. But it's true that if it stays at $3M it's probably too much and I don't think the memory bottleneck on gpus is large enough to justify this price/performance.\n \nreply",

      "I use GnuCash for business accounting and it does what I need. I don't use QuickBooks as VC's recommend in blog posts. QB has some convenient features, but that is not enough for me to pay the price QB is asking. I don't need VC money or a CPA.I haven't tried using GnuCash with Sqlite, but I would like to experiment when I get the time. Is it reliable?I used to be a technical/functional engineer for Oracle EBS, so I dealt with very complex schemas that interlinked with each other especially in the sub-ledgers.I've always toyed with the idea of adding Revenue Recognition functionality to GnuCash but am too busy to do so. Perhaps after seeing the schema in Sqlite I can take a shot at it.Cheers\n \nreply",
      "I've tried many personal accounting software and all of them (but old Pcoket Money for PalmOS!) are very unhelpful in filling in expenses.If you need to record whole shop visit as one transaction (like \"Food at Lidl\") it is tolerable, but as soon as you want to enter each line in your receipt as separate part of split transaction (like, food:milk = 2 euro, food:bread = 1 euro, food:eggs = 3 euro, food:meat:pork = 8 euro, etc) you need to type everything again and again without good suggestions, based on your previous history. Such suggestions could be very sophisticated, taking counterpart and other parameters and suggest \"food:bread\" and price by letters \"br\" if counterpart is \"Lidl\" or \"clothing:bra\" and other price if counterpart is \"Victoria Secret\", for example, but, alas, nothing I've tried, support this.Really, old (PalmOS 3.0!) Pocket Money was a breeze, and everything else, Desktop or Mobile, is much, much worse in this aspect.Also, I think, that when you have all you transactions vrty detailed, it is better to have nested \"categories\" and not nested \"accounts\". It is almost cosmetic difference, but it is strange for me to have \"cache\" and \"food:meat:pork\" as same type of objects. I don't transfer money to \"food:meat:pork\", I spend money for it. I transfer money to the shop, not to the product! As far as I know, professional accounting systems doesn't have account for each asset of the firm, like different accounts for monitors, laptops, computers and (computer) mices.Maybe, I don't find it yet? Any suggestions?\n \nreply",
      "As others have said, you're likely too granular. I just separate into \"Groceries\", \"Supplies\", \"Clothes\", etc.I couldn't quite understand what you need, but I use KMyMoney (migrated from GnuCash over a decade ago). If you've gone to Walmart and itemized in the past, then the next time you go to Walmart and import your CC statement, it will pick the last Walmart transaction with a similar total charge as your starting point. It's mildly helpful.And yes, it does do Categories instead of Accounts. The latter, however, is more in line with accounting principles.\n \nreply",
      "Is it actually all that useful to you to track each receipt line-item? For a few specific types of purchases, maybe, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest you might be taking on needless work that doesn't create value for you anywhere near that level of effort.\n \nreply",
      "I did this exercise for a little over a year to understand my expenses in detail. Like the OP, I found it really frustrating to do with any bookkeeping software I tried, to the point where I eventually gave up as I didn't think it was worth the effort. I started writing a web app to make this easier but just didn't have the motivation to finish.With that said, I learned quite a bit as a result of that level of granularity. When all expenses at Amazon, Walmart, etc go into the same bucket, it's really difficult to truly understand what you're spending your money on and if you have a problem you need to curb. Seeing \"$X in spending at Amazon\" isn't really that useful without knowing how important or frivolous any of those expenses were.\n \nreply",
      "There are many levels in between tracking at the \"Amazon\" level vs the \"Meat:Pork\" level. For example I currently track all unprepared food shopping as \"Groceries\", and would break down \"Amazon\" shopping into categories such as \"Electronics\" or \"Books\".Ultimately it comes down to how much effort you want to spend categorising spending, but there are many levels of granularity and orthogonal dimensions to slice against\n \nreply",
      "Sure, and my Amazon example wasn't very illustrative of the kind of information that could be gleamed from tracking this at a more granular level. A more concrete example is that my wife and I were flirting with the idea of reducing our meat consumption (for non-financial reasons) and wanted to see what the financial implications would be. Another example is to try to accurately price out past trips we went on: some things normally get filtered under other categories, such as clothes or other products purchased specifically for the trip.This level of granularity probably isn't worth it to most people, but I found it useful as an exercise to do once because it opened my eyes to insights about my expenses I never would have thought about otherwise. And if there were software that made this super easy to do (<1 minute per entry), I might still be doing it.\n \nreply",
      "Some stores are modern-day general stores (Costco, Walmart) so you will end up purchasing from several categories on one trip (gift, groceries, home maintenance). YNAB, for example, allows for splitting a single transaction across several categories but you have to figure out what the cost of that individual item was.It\u2019s annoying to do in Canada where sales tax is not included. The fly in the ointment is that certain categories are tax-exempt (essential foods, kids\u2019 clothing) but not others (prepackaged foods, adult clothing).If your shopping trip is across three or more categories (gifts, clothing, food), you\u2019ll have to figure out which items were tax-exempt before you can do any subdivision.\n \nreply",
      "I feel like it isn't for the vast majority of people. I did a bit of tracking on my spending but it just ends up showing that the vast majority of my spending was on rent and fixed bills which are very easy to track in just a spreadsheet. The amount I'm spending on biscuits and milk week to week doesn't matter at all in the grand scheme.A lot of banking apps these days will automatically categorize your spending as well which eliminated much of the need to manually enter it in to a different app.\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019m with you on that one. Been tracking my personal finances since 2011 and I have yet found a need to go deeper with analysis. \nAlthough I can imagine it could be interesting to go extra deep, e.g. to observe changes in my nutritional habits based on my grocery receipts juxtaposed with, say, my bloodwork. But even then it\u2019d be a gimmick as I could not potentially rely on any correlation noticed. I\u2019m sure someone could come up with a better example.In any case, unless tracking gets super easy, with digital receipts saved directly onto our mobile devices and standardized for processing, I just couldn\u2019t be bothered to break down paper receipts.That BTW makes me wonder why have we not seen e-receipts standardized yet. We can pay wirelessly with devices, so why not save some more meta data about the transaction, including the receipt itself? Seems like a low hanging fruit, also saving tons of paper.\n \nreply"

      "> To make the most of phrase matching, stop words need to go.Perhaps I am misunderstanding; does this mean occurrences of stop words like \"the\" are stored now instead of ignored? That seems like it would add a lot of bloat. Are there any optimizations in place?Just a shot-in-the-dark suggestion, but if you are storing some bits with each keyword occurrence, can you add a few more bits to store whether the term is adjacent to a common stop word? So maybe if you have to=0 or=1, \"to be or not to be\" would be able to match the data `0be 1not 0be`, where only \"be\" and \"not\" are actual keywords. But the extra metadata bits can be ignored, so pages containing \"The Clash\" will match both the literal query (via the \"the\" bit), and just \"clash\" (without the \"the\" bit).\n \nreply",

      "One of the problems with stop words is that they vary between languages. \"The\" is a good candidate in English, but in Danish it just means \"tea\", which should be a valid search term.

A textbook titled \u201cForty Studies that Changed Psychology,\u201d by Roger R. Hock, contains a section on Calhoun\u2019s work. It cautions, \u201cWe must always be careful in applying animal research to humans.\u201d In 1975, the textbook reports, researchers attempted to \u201creplicate with people some of Calhoun\u2019s findings\u201d by analyzing statistics like birth rates and mental-hospital admissions among New Yorkers: \u201cNo significant relationships were found between population density and any form of social pathology.\u201d\n \nreply",

      "> Having observed the rats so closely, Calhoun now had a pretty good idea of what was limiting growth. The rats had divided themselves into eleven clans. Four had burrows conveniently located at the center of the enclosure, near where Calhoun had placed the food bins. In these privileged clans, a few dominant male rats mated with (and protected) a larger number of females. Although the high-status mothers successfully raised many pups, this wasn\u2019t enough to offset the losses in a population that was aging and, increasingly, brawling.> The rats from the banlieues, for their part, lived under constant stress. When they attempted to get to the food bins, the fat rats in the middle tried\u2014often successfully\u2014to repulse them. Along the edges of the enclosure, packs of low-ranking males roamed from burrow to burrow, harassing the females. The outer-burrow females were so exhausted that they rarely conceived, and, when they did give birth, they often abandoned their pups.Not unless there was a group of people who had somehow figured out how to legally steal other people's UBI checks. The rats did not actually have access to infinite food. Some of the rats did, and they figured out how to monopolize that food source and exclude other rats.\n \nreply",

      "I lead an applied AI research team where I work - which is a mid-sized public enterprise products company. I've been saying this in my professional circles quite often.We talk about scaling laws, superintelligence, AGI etc. But there is another threshold - the ability for humans to leverage super-intelligence. It's just incredibly hard to innovate on products that fully leverage superintelligence.At some point, AI needs to connect with the real world to deliver economically valuable output. The ratelimiting step is there. Not smarter models.In my mind, already with GPT-4, we're not generating ideas fast enough on how best to leverage it.Getting AI to do work involves getting AI to understand what needs to be done from highly bandwidth constrained humans using mouse / keyboard / voice to communicate.Anyone using a chatbot already has felt the frustration of \"it doesn't get what I want\". And also \"I have to explain so much that I might as well just do it myself\"We're seeing much less of \"it's making mistakes\" these days.If we have open-source models that match up to GPT-4 on AWS / Azure etc, not much point to go with players like OpenAI / Anthropic who may have even smarter models. We can't even use the dumber models fully.\n \nreply",
      "* We're seeing much less of \"it's making mistakes\" these days.*Perhaps less than before, but still making very fundamental errors. Anything involving number I'm automatically suspicious. Pretty frequently I'd get different answers for the same question (to a human).e.g. ChatGPT will give an effective tax rate of n for some income amount. Then when asked to break down the calculation will come up with an effective tax rate of m instead. When asked how much tax is owed on that income will come up with a different number such that the effective rate is not n or m.Until this is addressed to a sufficient degree, it seems difficult to apply to anything that involves numbers and can't be quickly verified by a human.\n \nreply",
      "Yes. Numbers / math is pretty much instant hallucination.But. Try this approach instead: have it generate python code, with print statements before every bit of math it performs. It will write pretty good code, which you then execute to generate the actual answer.Simpler example: paste in a paragraph of text, ask it to count the number of words. The answer will be incorrect most of the time.Instead, ask it to out each word in the text in a numbered list and then output the word count. It will be correct almost always.My anecdotal learning from this:LLMs are pretty human-like in their mental abilities. I wouldn't be able to simply look at some text and give you an accurate word count. I would point my finger / cursor to every word and count up.The solutions above are basically giving LLMs some additional techniques or tools, very similar to how a human may use a calculator, or count words.In the products we've built, there is an AI feature that generates aggregations of spreadsheet data. We have a dual unittest & aggregator loop to generate correct values.The first step is to generate some unittests. And in order to generate correct numerical data for unittests, we ask it to write some code with math expressions first. We interpret the expressions, and paste it back into the unittest generator - which then writes the unittests with the correct inputs / outputs.Then the aggregation generator then generates code until the generated unittests pass completely. Then we have the code for the aggregator function that we can run against the spreadsheet.Takes a couple of minutes, but pretty bulletproof and also generalizable to other complex math calculations.\n \nreply",

Ask for a simpler question. Ask the LLM to divide the question into sub-questions. \nAsk the LLM what information it needs to answer the question, and try to get that info from a search engine.\nMost of the strategies humans and organizations use when they don't know something will work for LLMs.\nThe goal is to get an all high confidence chain of reasoning.If only they knew when they didn't know something.There's research on this.[4] No really good results yet, but some progress.

      "Second vote for Spin Selling from me.  Spin Selling is a must read for anyone doing long-term sales-- in particular, selling software that has a long sales cycle like a year from the time you get a prospect until you close the sale.  But it has other key concepts for smaller software packages too that you'll find useful if you're doing something smaller.\n \nreply",

      "Crossing the Chasm: Geoffrey A. Moore\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_ChasmBasically, there's a lot more to sales than just \"generate leads.\" You need to pick a \"right-sized\" market, tailor the product to the market (but not too much, so you can go after other markets,) and then as you grow, move to bigger markets.The markets you go after when your company is small are very different than when your company is established. Furthermore, small differences in your product are critical: A tiny feature or option might be critical in a tiny niche that you need to get started; but a completely different feature or option is needed when you're able to target a larger audience.\n \nreply"
