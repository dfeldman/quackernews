      "Google making Gemini 2.5 Pro (Experimental) free was a big deal. I haven't tried the more expensive OpenAI models so I can't even compare, only to the free models I have used of theirs in the past.Gemini 2.5 Pro is so much of a step up (IME) that I've become sold on Google's models in general. It not only is smarter than me on most of the subjects I engage with it, it also isn't completely obsequious. The model pushes back on me rather than contorting itself to find a way to agree.100% of my casual AI usage is now in Gemini and I look forward to asking it questions on deep topics because it consistently provides me with insight. I am building new tools with the mind to optimize my usage to increase it's value to me.\n \nreply",

      "After comparing Gemini Pro and Claude Sonnet 3.7 coding answers side by side a few times, I decided to cancel my Anthropic subscription and just stick to Gemini.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, IME, Anthropic seemed to be ahead of Google by a decent amount with Sonnet 3.5 vs 1.5 Pro.However, Sonnet 3.7 seemed like a very small increase, whereas 2.5 Pro seemed like quite a leap.Now, IME, Google seems to be comfortably ahead.2.5 Pro is a little slow, though.I'm not sure which model Google uses for the AI answers on search, but I find myself using Search for a lot of things I might ask Gemini (via 2.5 Pro) if it was as fast as Search's AI answers.\n \nreply",
      "How's is the speed of Gemini vs 3.7?\n \nreply",
      "One of the main advantages Anthropic currently has over Google is the tooling that comes with Claude Code. It may not generate better code, and it has a lower complexity ceiling, but it can automatically find and search files, and figure out how to fix a syntax error fast.\n \nreply",
      "As another person that cancelled my Claude and switched to Gemini, I agree that Claude Code is very nice, but beyond some initial exploration I never felt comfortable using it for real work because Claude 3.7 is far too eager to overengineer half-baked solutions that extend far beyond what you asked it to do in the first place.Paying real API money for Claude to jump the gun on solutions invalidated the advantage of having a tool as nice as Claude Code, at least for me, I admit everyone's mileage will vary.\n \nreply",
      "Google need to fix their Gemini web app at a basic level. It's slow, gets stuck on Show Thinking, rejects 200k token prompts that are sent one shot. Aistudio is in much better shape.\n \nreply",
      "Also the \"project\" feature in claude improves experience significantly for coder, where you can customize your workflow. Would be great if gemini has this feature.\n \nreply",
      "I've been using Gemini 2.5 and Claude 3.7 for Rust development and I have been very impressed with Claude, which wasn't the case for some architectural discussions where Gemini impressed with it's structure and scope. OpenAI 4.5 and o1 have been disappointing in both contexts.Gemini doesn't seem to be as keen to agree with me so I find it makes small improvements where Claude and OpenAI will go along with initial suggestions until specifically asked to make improvements.\n \nreply"

Building upon the popular foundation of 2.0 Flash, this new version delivers a major upgrade in reasoning capabilities, while still prioritizing speed and cost. Gemini 2.5 Flash is our first fully hybrid reasoning model, giving developers the ability to turn thinking on or off. The model also allows developers to set thinking budgets to find the right tradeoff between quality, cost, and latency. Even with thinking off, developers can maintain the fast speeds of 2.0 Flash, and improve performance.Our Gemini 2.5 models are thinking models, capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding. Instead of immediately generating an output, the model can perform a \"thinking\" process to better understand the prompt, break down complex tasks, and plan a response.

      "> An \u201cinterval\u201d is a combination of two notes.Minor nitpick: it's a \"dyad\" that is a combination of two notes.An \"interval\" is the difference between two (or more) pitches. And just as you'd measure the space between your eyebrows using a ruler, you'd measure the interval between middle C and concert A using your ears.The bonus, however, is that our listening apparatus is already quantized to octaves-- if you hear a pitch against a second pitch that's double/quadruple/etc. the frequency of the first, your ear marks this interval as special. It's likely most of you've already used this fact to your advantage; perhaps unwittingly, when someone begins singing \"Happy Birthday\" outside your normal singing range. (Though most renditions of \"Happy Birthday\" lend credence to Morpheus' lesson from The Matrix that there's a difference between knowing the path and walking it.) :)\n \nreply",

      "I find the analysis interesting in terms of a hobby project, but I'd be careful extrapolating too much out of this. 680k is quite the sample size, but my issue lies within the myopic selection of one instrument and the issues that arise from the platform of Ultimate Guitar.1. I am curious, how many of the 680k songs are unique? It is rather uncommon for massively successful songs to only have one version of tabs out in the wild, so I am curious how many songs individual songs were counted multiple times.2. This analysis only looks at guitar tabs or instrumentations there were transcribed for guitar. Chords can be made with more than just one instrument, thus that missing 7th note could actually be played by another instrument not included in the tabs.3. As music progressed from the pre-jazz era to modern times, it became more common for people to play an instrument, like piano or guitar, while singing at the same time. Obviously there are exceptions to everything, but often times guitar pieces are simplified if the guitarist is also singing for practical reasons.4. Music has also become more accessible as time progressed. It would be hard for an average person to learn the organ or hurry curdy without access to one. It's much easier to acquire and learn piano when it can be a 4 inch thick plastic keyboard on a stand.5. People tend to have a warped concept of the history of music. Pachelbel's Canon in D is by no means a complex song and has stood the test of time. Music through out time has also served different purposes. Hell, go back to Ancient Greece, Gregorian chants, and Medieval music. Those various time periods were not generally fully of complexity either. I would argue such times were generally less complex than modern music.\n \nreply",

Those various time periods were not generally fully of complexity either. I would argue such times were generally less complex than modern music.True facts. There are singles and bands that sold well into the millions in the fifties and sixties that culture has basically forgotten about because it was simple, disposable pop music. \"Yummy Yummy Yummy\" topped the charts in the late 60s and has, what, three chords in it? What about \"Sugar, Sugar\" or the Monkees? Staff songwriters and session cats cranked this stuff out by the ton back in the day but people still love to take potshots at modern pop music for being inferior to the oldies in this regard.\n \nreply",
      "Interesting analysis. Some observations:- Ultimate Guitar isn't exactly known for the sterling quality of its transcriptions. Teenage me submitted at least a few tabs that were clearly incorrect that still got 4 and 5 star ratings. Amateur guitarists are also infamously bad at figuring out voicings and extensions so something like a 9 might end up as a maj7 or just a triad. Adult me checks Songsterr first then uses his ear to figure out what's _really_ going on when I run across incorrect parts in the tablature.- Some genres of music like downtuned metal are largely monophonic and instead rely on quick melodic movement or  drone-y background guitars to imply harmony. This data set doesn't seem to account for this.- There's no way that power chords only account for single-digit percentages of chords in rock, metal, and punk. There are albums that have been certified Platinum that are 90% power chords (technically power intervals, I suppose).\n \nreply",

Likewise authors will choose simpler chord substitutes to make it easier to play.It's the same with lead sheets / the real book style music books. Performing musicians need to reproduce music quickly so only the triad will be written down even if the musician ends up playing some other extensions.The data is heavily biased towards simplicity. You can make conclusions about the data - but not music as a whole.\n \nreply",

      "With dynamically typed languages I feel it's better to wait until you've tried to maintain the code for a while before you consider the languages effectiveness.I had to maintain a very large Lua codebase that has been active for several years. One big problem with Lua was how it will happily take more or less parameters to functions and continue to execute compared to something like Python where it is an error to pass the wrong parameters. This meant when we update a function signature we would often incorrectly update call sites, etc.I can't remember the specifics but we had a few issues with tables being both dictionaries and lists. IIRC, if you delete a list index and there are later list indices, they will turn into dictionary keys. We had a few bugs to do with not traversing the entire array portion of a Lua table because of this.I also implemented a few classic algorithms, e.g. bisect in Lua and you have to be very careful with 1-based indices. You also have to be very careful when interfacing between C and Lua. I prefer 0-based indices and [start, stop) style ranges for everything nowadays.I much prefer statically typed code during maintenance. But dynamically typed languages like Python or Typescript where you can bolt on types, later if you wish, are not too bad.Also using named parameters as much as possible is great for maintenance.\n \nreply",

People who don't manage to that quickly enough their eyes stay open, they don't even feel anything is wrong, but they are physically unable to put on their masks until they pass out.If not eating proper food kills you in 3 weeks, not breathing proper air kills you in 3 minutes. Yet, people spend thousands of dollars on a new diet, but have no idea what kind of stuff are going into their lungs.The situation is not life and death. It's feeling nice versus feeling low. People end up with indoor air that is often stale and full of volatile compounds. We often make it worse by using essential oil diffusers and not using the vent hood when cooking.When you do a breathing exercise, all of a sudden you are giving your starving brain a dose of what it could be like. When you have a walk in the nature, you do the same.So yes, breathing exercises are great, but it's even better if we fix our indoor environments to feel great at all times.\n \nreply",

      "I used (abused) HDR in an editorial project last year. We were working with an amazing illustrator doing a take on series of stories exploring the intersection of faith, storytelling, and technology.As the early versions of the images emerged we thought we could used HDR to provide more or a aura to some elements. We tried to make it subtle and not overwhelm.This example is my favorite:https://restofworld.org/2024/divinity-altered-reality-muslim...I think it worked well - and this technique would have been useful. We tried something similar but could not get it to work.Our method was to use a stretched HDR video in the background.Here are the steps I used:In Photoshop create white image to proportions required. Save as MP4:  File > Export > Render Video\n\nSave as \"sample.mp4\"With the MP4, generate a HDR version in WEBM:  ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -color_primaries 9 -color_trc 16 -colorspace 9 -color_range 1 -profile:v 2 -vcodec libvpx-vp9 sample.webm\n\nWith the plain MP4, generate the HDR version:  ffmpeg -i sample.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -color_primaries 9 -color_trc 16 -colorspace 9 -color_range 1 -profile:v high10 -vcodec libx264 sample.mp4\n \nreply",

      "I have a substantial investment in both Dewalt and Milwaukee tools that I use regularly in my farming operation. I definitely prefer the Milwaukee tools to the Dewalt. I recently bought a 6\" Milwaukee chain saw for light duty cutting. I get a lot of cuts before I have to change batteries. Also the torque in the Milwaukee 3/4\" impact gun is truly amazing and the battery lasts through a lot of bolt removals.\n \nreply",
      "Always love to see an in-depth reverse engineering write-up. This one's particularly interesting since I'm currently designing a battery pack for my own project.Interesting to see a microcontroller (and quite a classic one...) as well as an ASIC for battery management. I imagine it's for communication purposes. The battery management chips I've been looking at have built in I2C interfaces to let me avoid firmware.\n \nreply",
      "I've been down this road before. The ASIC in the Milwaukee pack is known as an \"analog front end\". Since you can't wire cells directly up to the pins of your MCU, you have a chip to handle that stuff for you. It will let you read the voltage of each cell in the stack (some are literally analog, and just provide a nicely in-range voltage output for your MCU's ADC to read; others have internal ADCs). It might do current sensing. It might handle a couple alarms to turn off a mosfet when things go wrong. It will have an I2C interface, but the supported commands are \"tell me voltage of cell #2\" or \"put shunt resistor on cell #1 for balancing\". It's still the MCU that calls most of the shots here, but the more advanced ASICs can do more things autonomously.\n \nreply",

They're also expensive af so you want to wait for a sale if possible. I even spent a ridiculous amount of money on the battery-powered wet/dry vac and haven't regretted it for a moment.\n \nreply",

I got one of the 7 1/4\" circular saws with a FORGE battery and it just cuts everything I've thrown at it effortlessly.  I'd put it as more powerful than my Dewalt 10\" corded tablesaw, at least it seems much happier to rip a 2x4 than the table saw.  I even designed a 3D printed sled for it to run on my track saw tracks and it does a great job there.\n \nreply",
      "Some of the battery powered tools really are more powerful these days, since a home 110v circuit is limited to a total draw of 1800w or so. The latest gen 18v/24v batteries can actually deliver more than that, at least for short bursts. Especially the big 4AH+ packs.\n \nreply",

      "Most of English's inconsistent spelling came about from incomplete pronunciation shifts. So while sky still rhymes with by, it no longer with archery. Fixing this is difficult, not just because people are resistant to change, but also because the variations in accents.However, we're also introducing a lot of new inconsistencies due to a relatively recent shift to adopting foreign words without changing the spelling or pronunciation as we would have in the past - something no other language does. This forces English readers to learn multiple foreign orthographies and English's to read English.Oddly, the British are often are better about this. They see the word \"jalapeno\" and pronounce it like you'd expect (and get mocked for it) with English's orthography, as opposed to forcing everyone to use Spanish orthography to pronounce it halapenyo.\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019ll have to give this a read! It reminds me of this quote often attributed to Mark Twain (although not verified):\u201cFor example, in year 1 that useless letter \u2018c\u2019 would be dropped to be replased either by \u2018k\u2019 or \u2018s\u2019, and likewise \u2018x\u2019 would no longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which \u2018c\u2019 would be retained would be the \u2018ch\u2019 formation, which will be dealt with later. Year 2 might reform \u2018w\u2019 spelling, so that \u2018which\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019 would take the same konsonant, wile year 3 might well abolish \u2018y\u2019 replasing it with \u2018i\u2019 and Iear 4 might fiks the \u2018g/j\u2019 anomali wonse and for all. \u2026 After this bakward progression, there would be no more trubl with kommas, semikolons, etc.\u201d\n \nreply",

      "Writing protocol code in Erlang is nice, because the parsing is so easy and clear. And if you want to do something that's not so easy by spawning a command, then you may as well build it in Erlang. And it's fun and symmetric to build both a server and a client... I've not looked at OTP SSH code, but I'd assume the ciphering is still calls to external c libraries, as it is in the OTP TLS code.Of course, easy protocol parsing doesn't do the whole job; state management is required too (and was missed here, clearly).\n \nreply",
      "This is probably because C NIFs run in the same process as the Erlang scheduler. If you have a long-running or blocking NIF, it can starve the scheduler and cause significant performance degradation across the system.\n \nreply",

Inside NIFs, I think you want to use enif_select [1] (and friends), available since OTP 20 originally from 2017-06-21. In a port driver, you'd use driver_select [2] which I think has been around forever --- there's mentions of changes in R13 which I think was mostly release 2009-11-20 (that may have been R13B though).[1] https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_nif.html#enif_selec...[2] https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_driver.html#driver_...\n \nreply",

      "It is a shame when people let current alliances override their actual thinking on general principles.

      "A long, long time ago (within the past ten years), I had to verify my age with a site. They didn't ask for my ID, or my facial scan, but instead asked for my credit card number.  They issued a refund to the card of a few cents, and I had to tell them (within 24hr) how much the refund was for, after which point they'd issue a charge to claw it back.  They made it clear that debit and gift cards would not be accepted, it must be a credit card.  So I grabbed my Visa card, punched in the numbers, checked my banking app to see the +$0.24 refund, entered the value, got validated, and had another -$0.24 charge to claw it back.Voila, I was verified as an adult, because I could prove I had a credit card.The whole point of mandating facial recognition or ID checks isn't to make sure you're an adult, but to keep records of who is consuming those services and tie their identities back to specific profiles.  Providers can swear up and down they don't retain that information, but they often use third-parties who may or may not abide by those same requests, especially if the Gov comes knocking with a secret warrant or subpoena.Biometric validation is surveillance, plain and simple.\n \nreply",
      "That was, in fact, what COPA mandated in the US in 1998, and SCOTUS struck it down as too onerous in Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, kicking off the last 20 years of essentially completely unregulated Internet porn commercially available to children with nothing more than clicking an \"I'm 18\" button. At the time, filtering was seen as a better solution. Nowadays filtering is basically impossible thanks to TLS (with things like DoH and ECH being deployed to lock that down even further), apps that ignore user CAs and use attestation to lock out owner control, cloud CDNs, TLS fingerprinting, and extreme consolidation of social media (e.g. discord being for both minecraft discussions and furry porn).\n \nreply",

      "Oh, make no mistake, I hate both of these. I loathe this forced surveillance of everyone because parents can't be bothered to supervise and teach their children about the most primary of human animal functions (sex), regardless of their reasons for it.I take great pains to keep minors out of my adult spaces, and don't have to resort to anything as invasive as biometric surveillance or card charges.  This notion that the entire world should be safe for children by default, and that anything and everything adult should be vilified and locked up, is toxic as all get-out and builds shame into the human animal over something required for the perpetuation of the species.The adult content isn't the problem, it's the relationship some folks have towards it that's the issue.  That's best corrected by healthy intervention early on, not arbitrary age checks everywhere online that mainly serve as an exercise of power by the ruling class against \"undesirable\" elements of society.\n \nreply",

      "I would like to think there there is a solution that can be engineered, in which a service is able to verify that a user is above an appropriate age threshold, while maintaining privacy safeguards, including, where relevant, for the age-protected service not to be privy to the identity of the user, and for the age verification service to not be privy to the nature of the age-protected service being accessed.In this day and age, of crypto, and certificates, and sso, and all that gubbins, it's surely only a matter of deciding that this is a problem that needs solving.(Unless the problem really isn't the age of the user at all, but harvesting information...)\n \nreply",
