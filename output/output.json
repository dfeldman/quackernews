      "I did something similar with a receipt printer.a thermal usb receipt printer is like $75 dollars and easily controlled by python. Super easy to print out images and QR codes. and the autocut functionality makes it easy to segment messages. Additionally the receipt printer is nice because you can activate the bell inside as an additional \"notification\" and has an extra control for a cash drawer that I am thinking of hooking into to control a light or something.I had it set up for emails and every morning it would print off my calendar.I think the interface works well especially if you pair it with a physical control like buttons or NFC reader. That way you can issue \"commands\" and get output. Like I had one NFC card to make it print my calendar, one for unread emails, etc.I have some more features I want to add to it. Its very fun way to cut down on screen time, but ironically i have spent more screen time coding with it and setting it up then it probably has saved me. lol.\n \nreply",

      "The most mainstream phenol free thermal paper put there is one made from a branded chemical \"pergafast\" which is supposedly based off of urea. This is increasingly the type used by big brand stores where the paper is advertised as BPA and BPS free. It appears safe in studies so far in terms of not being absorbed through the skin nor endocrine disrupting, but is also known to be highly toxic to aquatic life. There's another chemical related to vitamin c branded \"Alpha Free\" but it's harder to find.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S02732...\n \nreply",

      "What about the difference that the human knows what they don't know?In contrast, the llm knows nothing, but confidently half regurgitates correlational text that it is seen before.\n \nreply",
      "> The majority of humans in flesh can't solve the problem\n\nThis is a non sequitur.All humans have the capacity to reason, but not all humans reason. There's a big difference. Hell, even GPT-4o will tell you this.Here, don't trust me, let's ask GPT about memorization and reasoning  Prompt: \n  Suppose a LLM is able to get the right answer to a question, but when asked about the steps to arrive at the answer they are not able to provide an accurate solution. Does this tell us anything about a model's ability to reason or its ability to memorize?  What about when it gets the right answer but the explanation would lead to a different answer than the one stated?\n\n  Response:\n  These scenarios highlight important aspects of a model's capabilities and limitations regarding reasoning and memorization.  Let's break them down:\n\n\n  1. **LLM Gets the Right Answer but Can't Explain the Steps:**\n    - **Memorization vs. Reasoning:** If a model provides a correct answer without accurately explaining the steps, it might indicate that the model is relying more on memorization rather than understanding or reasoning. The model could have seen similar questions in its training data and learned to associate certain questions with specific answers without truly understanding the underlying principles.\n    - **Reasoning Limitations:** This situation suggests that the model may not have a robust ability to reason through the problem-solving process. It highlights a gap between recognizing patterns in data and applying logical reasoning to derive answers.\n\n  2. **LLM Provides Correct Answer but Incorrect Explanation:**\n    - **Memorization of Answers:** This might suggest that the model has memorized the answer from similar examples in the training data but does not understand the reasoning process. It could be retrieving an answer that it \"knows\" is correct without understanding why.\n    - **Inconsistent Reasoning Ability:** Giving a correct answer with an explanation that would lead to a different answer indicates inconsistencies in its reasoning ability. It may reflect that the model's internal heuristics for generating explanations are not aligned with the logic used to derive answers.\n\n  In both cases, these issues highlight the challenges in AI related to understanding vs. pattern recognition. While LLMs are excellent at recognizing patterns and retrieving information, their ability to reason logically and consistently can be limited. This differentiation is crucial when evaluating the capabilities of AI models, particularly in contexts where understanding and accurate reasoning are essential.\n \nreply",
      "Deducing things from the inability of an LLM to answer a specific question seemed doomed by the \"it will be able to on the next itteration\" principle.It seems like the only way you could systematic chart the weaknesses of an LLM is by having a class of problems that get harder for LLMs at a steep rate, so a small increase in problem complexity requires a significant increase in LLM power.\n \nreply",
      "> Deducing things from the inability of an LLM to answer a specific question seemed doomed by the \"it will be able to on the next itteration\" principle.\n\nThat's orthogonal.If we are pointing in the right direction(s) then yes, next iteration could resolve all problems.If we are not pointing in the right direction(s) then no, next iteration will not resolve these problems.Given LLMs rapid improvement in regurgitating knowledge from their training data but simultaneously slow improvement in their ability to generalize (such as logic \"puzzles\"), I think it is naive to assume we're pointed in the right direction. Maybe we're even pointing in mostly the right direction. But why assume we are?We can continue in the direction we are going while simultaneously considering it might not be well aligned. If we are well aligned, that gives us more confidence and makes gathering funding easier. If we aren't, well it is easier to course correct sooner than later. In either case, you benefit from the analysis.Understanding why things fail is more important than understanding why things succeed.\n \nreply",
      "This seems like a terrible test case since python examples are readily available in the training data: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Cheryl%27s_birthdayIt's interesting that so many of the model's fail to retrieve this, but any thta do solve it should clearly be able to do so with no reasoning/theory of mind.\n \nreply",

      "Wonderful work, but this doesn\u2019t look like local first software to me. It looks like server first software with live updates and caching.Don\u2019t get me wrong, that\u2019s super cool - but if you\u2019re going to claim it\u2019s local first software, I want to see the principles of local first software at play. And I don\u2019t think Zero delivers that - at least as I understand it from its website.Like, \u201cthe network is optional\u201d and \u201cthe long now\u201d and \u201cyou (the user) retains ultimate control\u201d. It just looks like an excellent server sync system with client side caching. What if the data I need isn\u2019t in the cache? What happens when I edit things offline then come online later? What happens if the company shuts down and the server gets turned off permanently? Will the app still work?Local first software can handle these cases too.[1] https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/\n \nreply",
      "I think this is fair, as they haven't committed to offline - though they've said they want to do it, they just want to wait to do it right. That said, they do work fully client-side, so I wouldn't say it's server-first, it's more of a hybrid. I will try and clear this up in our wording.Final note on the user-stuff: that's always up to the person writing the app anyway. You could make a \"download the IndexedDB\" button with a couple lines of code, but it's more than that, it's really a whole bunch of decisions you have to make as an app-developer to commit to it. And tbh I think the general understanding of local-first has settled on client-side + optimistic + offline - for the better.\n \nreply",
      "> I wouldn't say it's server-first because the mutations are happening locally first and every feature works fully client-side.That's not even close to what \"local first software\" means.Can apps work without the server? Like, if the server goes down, will the app still work?Can I collaboratively edit my data without the origin server? (Or at all?) Normally replication built on raw postgres queries relies on atomic row level locks on the server, while processing transactions. What happens if two people edit the same data at the same time?Does it support end-to-end encryption, so my data isn't readable by the server at all?Can I back up the app & my data together, and open it back up in 5 years and have the app still work?All this stuff is talked about in the local first paper. Putting a sync engine in front of postgres (as described by the zerosync website) doesn't do any of this stuff. (Or maybe some of it? Its hard to tell without more information, and I can't find a link to the source code.)All this makes me suspect the authors of Zerosync haven't actually read the local first paper. It reminds me when Zoom advertised E2E encryption on zoom's website because the CTO clearly didn't know what \"end to end encryption\" actually means. It looks like an excellent product - so why exaggerate its capabilities?\"Local first\" doesn't mean \"edits are applied speculatively in the client before they hit the server\". It also doesn't mean \"caching part of the centralized postgres database in the client\".Go read the paper. The details matter. https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/\n \nreply",
      "That is a disappointing interpretation of \u201clocal-first\u201d, and would not suit the kind of applications I want to write.On the other hand, this is still tethered to the server, so likely more commercially viable than a true local-first design.\n \nreply",

      "As a native iOS mobile developer, I was curious so I got into the TestFlight and downloaded the demo app. Thoughts:* Overall, not bad. Using React Native is far better than trying to mimic platform UI in the web, which is always terrible. \n* When tapping on an item on the \u201cFeed\u201d, the transition is made to the details _and then_ the navigation bar has a sudden title transition. This is weird. \n* The button in the upper left to switch between light and dark mode is nice but it should default to the system setting. It did not for me.  \n* The Notifications tab content isn\u2019t scrollable at all on my phone.  Seems like a bug. \n* If you tap on an item in Notifications you navigate deeper in, but when you hit back you are back on the Feed tab.Coming from native app development, it has the normal uncanny valley feeling that React Native gives off but for normal users they may not notice it as much.\n \nreply",

      "There's a scene in \"That 70's Show\" where Kelso and Red bond over Pong and decide to mod the game to make it harder. And a few hours later with a soldering iron, smaller paddles!The first time I saw that episode was at a friend's house. I felt so smart telling him that was impossible because you can't mod software with a soldering iron. Then his dad poked his head out from the kitchen and told me Pong didn't have software.Turns out the only impossible part of that episode is the idea of it taking a few hours. Changing the paddle size was a mod already supported by the hardware and the manual gave details on how to do it. Though it wasn't necessarily intended as a difficulty setting, it was intended to support different sizes of TVs. iirc, all you need to do is solder 1 jumper.\n \nreply",

      "I've seen a schematic of a Pong like game made with digital circuits like counters and comparators.Each player has a Y position controller. So and Y1 and Y2 register. Then the ball has an x and y position. The game logic is controller by comparators to detect events like reaching borders or within the paddle width range. So for example if you reach the left border and is within left paddle range then bounce the ball back right otherwise the left player loses.In terms of drawing to the screen, again compare the screen pixel position to each of the two paddles and ball position. Drawing the score was a little more complex but your have a counter for each players score and that determines which lines to draw. So you OR together the output from many comparator logic to determine the pixel should be lit or not.\n \nreply",

      "I kind of see myself from ten years ago in this blog post! I also obsessively studied Mandarin Chinese in my late teens for the sheer fun of it, before doing a math undergrad. I even wrote comments on Hacker News about it a decade ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7622940.At the time I had seemingly limitless motivation for grinding away on flashcards and other learning materials. My progress was strong and I passed the HSK6 after a year and a half or so of studying, which at the time was the highest level of certification offered. I think they changed the system since and added more levels beyond 6. You can do amazing things if you're dedicated!Today my Chinese is absolutely unusable, and my views on China have soured to the extent that I don't really want to revive my old skills. My takeaway is that learning one of these languages, the CJK languages, Arabic, or similarly weird languages, is just too much effort and I don't think it's worth it. I clearly had a lot of excess energy at the time that I could've directed towards something better. Knowing Chinese is about as useful as juggling and you might as well get really good at juggling if you're bored. It'll save you a few thousand hours.\n \nreply",
      "Passing HSK 6 is hard, congrats.Instead of seeing it as a massive grind, you could integrate it into your life in small ways e.g. conversing with native speakers, reading some of your daily content in Chinese, etc. You'd get the skill back essentially for free, and enjoy it more.\n \nreply",
      "> Today my Chinese is absolutely unusableSomething similar happened to me -- did intensive Mandarin study in college followed by a summer in Beijing being totally immersed. Was incredible. Then continued with a language course back home, and watched as my vocabulary shrank -- something like 4 hrs/wk. of class (with homework on top) couldn't even maintain my Mandarin, much less improve it. Today I can't understand a thing -- I've literally forgotten it all except for counting to ten and some basic phrases. In hindsight, it was utterly wasted effort, except for the cultural benefits of the summer abroad.In contrast, I can understand and get by in French and Spanish and Italian just fine, despite having studied those far less. If I'm traveling somewhere I just do a quick review of verb conjugations beforehand. But they just share so many cognates with English. When television is t\u00e9l\u00e9vision or televisi\u00f3n or televisione it's just not that hard. But when television is di\u00e0nsh\u00ec, and virtually every word is brand-new like that... it's just not worth it.(And even when you learn a new word in e.g. Spanish that's totally different from English, you'll often get it \"for free\" in another one -- e.g. \"pretend\" is fingir in Spanish, and fingere in Italian.)\n \nreply",

Already we (in the US) get (and choose to use!!) parts whose data sheets are only available in Chinese. It seems clear to me where we are going.\n \nreply",

There's just a crazy amount of drive (and what sounds like an epic memory) here.I don't think people consider base motivation enough when thinking about processes and this guy won some kind of biological and/or upbringing lottery.\n \nreply",

      "Having grown up in the US with what I would consider a higher than average exposure to the early 2000s internet, at least compared to other peers my age, much of my ability to read and write actually came directly from social media, instant messengers and online games rather than books. This meant I often found myself struggling with spelling errors in English class which sadly resulted in deducted points from my essays.I eventually came to realize many of my spelling \"errors\" were actually due to my exposure to the British spellings for many common words I would see online, like color/colour or behavior/behaviour for example. Unfortunately my teachers were a little unreasonable about this and would still deduct points when I pointed this out...To this day I still inconsistently use all spelling variants, and curse Noah Webster for his half assed attempt at regional spelling reform.

I don't think it's unreasonable for teachers to mark this down, though I don't think your request to get back the points was unreasonable either.Communicating effectively with your particular audience (the local American audience one in this case) is arguably a skill they're trying to teach you. Using language constructs that are unnatural for your audience can distract them and disrupt their flow. You don't want your reader to see \"enrol\" and spend the next 5-10 seconds pondering if you're illiterate or unable to run a spellchecker instead of spending that time digesting your actual point. This friction gets in the way of your point, thus ultimately hurting your own cause in addition to wasting their time. So when you keep doing that on your assignments and exams, you're effectively showing that you haven't mastered this skill -- and so it's not unreasonable for your grade to reflect that.\n \nreply",

      "ESP32 uses the Xtensa instruction set. As far as I understand this is a custom instruction set, which is surprisingly popular in low power applications.Investigating this lead me to an interesting polish company called semihalf who were recently acquired by google.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLh1FOcGysYApparently they added some Xtensa support to clang. I guess that means xtensa is very important in the android context.\n \nreply",
      "Xtensa is from Tensilica (now Cadence) but, as sibling comments point out, new Espressif designs use RISC-V. There's a bit of an overlap point: the ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 are recent designs that use Xtensa, and they were released at roughly the same time as the ESP32-C3 (I believe the first Espressif RISC-V part).Here's the ISA summary for Xtensa LX as used by the ESP32: https://www.cadence.com/content/dam/cadence-www/global/en_US...The S2 & S3 are more powerful and capable than the currently available Espressif RISC-V microcontrollers. Perhaps it's best to think of them marking the summit or climax of Espressif's Xtensa parts. But the future clearly lies with RISC-V.The Xtensa support in LLVM/Clang appears to have resulted (at least in part) from Espressif's active support for Rust on their microcontrollers. The recent Rust 1.81 release merged support for the ESP32, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 into upstream rustc. It's great to see a microcontroller vendor directly support the use of Rust on its parts, and not just its \"new\" parts.Edit: To be clear, the ESP-IDF framework is a huge C project, so Espressif working on LLVM support for Xtensa is clearly _not just_ for Rust. And \"easy mode\" Rust-on-Espressif (std support!) relies on the ESP-IDF so merging their patches into LLVM is beneficial all-round.\n \nreply",
      "Xtensa is an interesting \"instruction set\" because it's not one single instruction set but it's a \"parametric instruction set\" (hence the name which hints at \"extensible\")When instantiating an xtensa core you can choose how many registers you want, whether you want to have register windows or not, and many other options.If you want a compiler that targets a given instance of that architecture you have to tailor it to those parameters.\n \nreply",

Use the ESP WiFi to change the message remotely. That was easy enough : the SSD1306 is supported by the Adafruit-GFX library, which makes simple rendering trivial.I initially pulled the messages from a github-hosted txt file, which required a constant WiFi connection.

      "I know cryptocurrencies have a lot of problems, but this is one place where it\u2019s good they exist: they\u2019ve funneled a ton of money into researching new cryptography. The article claims that this research was developed for StarkWare, which developed its own form of zero knowledge proofs they called Starks, developed a programming language in which cryptographic proofs can be generated showing that the output of the program was truly produced from the inputs[^1], and continued to do more research like this. While I\u2019m not a cryptographer, I think this sort of thing is super cool and I\u2019m glad there\u2019s a lot of attention and effort going into it.^[1] the cool thing about these proofs is that they can be verified in much less time than is required to run the program. IIRC, starks can be verified in log-polynomial time, and snarks can be verified in constant time. This allows cryptocurrency protocols to have one computer in the network generate a proof of the state of the chain given a new block, and all other are able to quickly check it. Without this, you have a ton of waste because every computer in the network must duplicate the work of computing the new chain state. (although some new waste is introduced by the fact that producing a proof is very slow, although this is another area that cryptocurrency-funded research has improved dramatically)Another cool bit of cryptography research that I think was motivated by crypto was \u201cverkle trees\u201d, an improvement on merkle trees that uses vector commitments rather than your typical hash. A vector commitment is like a hash, but it hashes an array of items and you can check that the hash was produced from an array with a certain item at a certain index without knowing the other items in the array. If you use this to back a merkle tree, you can increase the branching factor a lot and end up with much smaller proofs that a particular item is in the tree. This is because the proof size for a merkle tree is b * log_b n (where b is the branching factor and n is the number of items in the tree). The proof size for a verkle tree is just log_b n, so you can increase b as much as you want without making the proofs bigger.Full disclosure: I work for a blockchain company, but not one mentioned here. I have no equity or stake in crypto outside of the fact that if the price goes to 0 my company probably can no longer afford to employ me\n \nreply",

But it was soon exposed as a fake, manipulated by artificial intelligence - so why do people still believe it\u2019s real?\u201cI seriously don't understand why I have to constantly put up with these dumbasses here every day.\u201dSo began what appeared to be a long tirade from the principal of Pikesville High School, punctuated with racist, antisemitic and offensive tropes. It sounded like it had been secretly recorded.The speaker went on to bemoan \u201cungrateful black kids\u201d and Jewish people in the community.The clip, first posted in January, went viral nationally. But it really struck a nerve in the peaceful, leafy suburb of Pikesville, which has large black and Jewish communities, and in the nearby city of Baltimore, Maryland.

      "Looks really good. I've felt the need for such an app on more than one occasions. But I'll have to wait for the iOS version I guess (based on the other comment).Aside: Following your github link led me to discover another one of your music related projects, harmony-explorer which seems quite similar to something I've wanted to build for myself.\n \nreply",
      "Congrats on shipping!I enjoyed your write up, and was surprised to read that it was built in Godot, which I'd only ever considered for games, but of course it makes sense that games are simply a kind of app.Love that you employ the circle of 5ths in the keyboard, whereas a more naive approach might've been to just ascend stepwise from C.Any plans for an iOS version? Does Godot make it easy to port to other platforms?\n \nreply",

      "Thanks a lot! Yeah, when I had the idea for the circle of fifths keyboard, I knew I just had to build it because it has so many benefits compared to the naive approach, especially when thinking \"harmonically\".Yes, there are plans for an iOS version! Godot has native support for iOS, so it should be pretty much plug-and-play. I haven't done it yet because of the developer fee that Apple charges, and because I am mainly an Android user myself. If there is enough interest though, I'm sure my partner would let me borrow her Macbook & iPad in order to bring this out though :)\n \nreply",
      "Yes please! Plus one for an iOS version !!App looks lovely\n \nreply",
      "plus two\n \nreply",
      "This looks really cool.How long have you played the Stick?  I\u2019ve played a few stringed instruments, but I\u2019ve never even seen one irl. I\u2019m curious as to how you would compare playing that vs. a traditional guitar?\n \nreply",
      "Looks really cool.Would you concider addinf support for numbers only. Generally for my use case I actually only use numbers and not specific chords... I IV V vii  etc\n \nreply",
      "Yes I have considered support for roman numeral notation! It would not be too hard to put the keyboard into a mode where roman numerals are displayed for the note keys & chart itself.\n \nreply",
      "Congrats! Looks like a very clean app.Because it isn't clear from the launch page: can it play sounds? I'm wondering if it can \"audition\" chords so that I can get a double-check on whether I'm picking the right one. I'm a musician who mostly plays by ear and improvisation, and I sometimes have to spend an annoying amount of time figuring out the correct  name of a chord if I want to write it down for another musician to play.  (a feature that showed which notes made up each chord, maybe behind a long press or something, would also be handy for this)\n \nreply"
