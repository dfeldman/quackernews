You need to think of Larry Ellison the way you think of a lawnmower. You don't anthropomorphize your lawnmower, the lawnmower just mows the lawn.

      "Obligatory Schwarzenegger:\"The kind of people who train alongside you in a gym makes a difference. If you are surrounded by people who are serious and train with a lot of intensity, it's easier for you to do the same thing. But it can be pretty hard to really blast your muscles while the people around you are just going through the motions. That is why good bodybuilders tend to congregate in certain gyms. By having the example of other serious bodybuilders constantly in front of you, you will train that much harder.\nThat is what made Joe Gold's original gym in Venice, California such a great place\u2014a small gym with just enough equipment, but where you would constantly be rubbing shoulders with the great bodybuilders against whom I had the privilege of competing-like Franco Columbu, Ed Corney, Dave Draper, Robby Robinson, Frank Zane, Sergio Oliva, and Ken Waller. Nowadays, it's rare to find that many champions in the same place, but if you aren't sharing the gym floor with great bodybuilders like Flex Wheeler, Shawn Ray, Nasser El Sonbaty, or Dorian Yates, it can be very motivating if there are pictures or posters of these individuals on the walls or championship trophies displayed.\nIn 1980, training at World Gym for my final Mr. Olympia competition, I showed up at the gym at seven o'clock one morning to work out and stepped out on the sundeck for a moment. Suddenly the sun came through the clouds. It was so beautiful I lost all my motivation to train. I thought maybe I would go to the beach instead. I came up with every excuse in the book-the most persuasive being that I had trained hard the day before with the powerful German bodybuilder Jusup Wilkosz, so I could lay back today\u2014but then I heard weights being clanged together inside the gym and I saw Wilkosz working his abs, Ken Waller doing shoulders, veins standing out all over his upper body, Franco Columbu blasting away, benching more than 400 pounts, Samir Bannout punishing his biceps with heavy Curls.\nEverywhere I looked there was some kind of hard, sweaty training going on, and I knew that I couldn't afford not to train if I was going to compete against these champions. Their example sucked me in, and now I was looking forward to working, anticipating the pleasure of pitting my muscles against heavy iron. By the end of that session I had the best pump I could imagine, and an almost wasted morning had turned into one of the best workouts of my life. If I hadn't been there at World Gym, with those other bodybuilders to inspire and motivate me, I doubt that day would have ended up being so productive.\nEven today, when I'm training for other reason, such as getting into top shape for a movie role, or just trying to stay in shape, I absorb energy from people working out around me. That's why I still like to go to gyms where bodybuilders are training for competition. Even today, after all this time, it still inspires me.\"p. 87 in the 1999 edition of /The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding/, by Schwarzenegger and Bill Dobbins. http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0684857219/reply"

      "People on the bbchallenge Discord server are keen to speculate on how many Turing Machine states are needed to surpass Graham's Number, which is vastly larger than the 2^^2^^2^^9 achieved by the latest BB(6) champion.We know from the functional busy beaver [1] that Graham behaviour can come surprisingly early; a 49-bit lambda term  suffices. There are only 77519927606 closed lambda terms of at most that size [2], compared to 4^12*23836540=399910780272640 unique 6-state Turing Machines [3].With the achievement of pentation in only 6 states, several people now believe that 7 states should suffice to surpass Graham's. I would still find that rather surprising.\nA few days ago, I made a large bet with one of them on whether we would see proof of BB(7)>Graham's within the next 10 years.What do people here think?[1] https://oeis.org/A333479[2] https://oeis.org/A114852[3] https://oeis.org/A107668reply",
      "I can't pretend to be an expert, but I'll argue BB(7) is probably larger than Graham's number.BB has to grow faster than any computable sequence. What exactly that means concretely for BB(7) is... nothing other than handwaving... but it sort of means it needs to walk up the \"operator strength\" ladder very quickly... it eventually needs to grow faster than any computable operator we define (including, for example, up-arrow^n, and up-arrow^f(n) for any computable f).My gut feeling is that the growth between 47 million and 2^^2^^2^^9 is qualitatively larger than the growth between 2^^2^^2^^9 and graham's number in terms of how strong the operator we need is (with gramah's number being g_64 and g here being roughly one step \"above\" up_arrow^n). So probably we should have BB(7)>Graham's number.reply",
      "Apologies if this feels adversarial, but I think your informal proof has an error, and I think I can explain it!Your proof rests primarily on this assertion:> BB has to grow faster than any computable sequence.This is almost true! BB(n) has to grow faster than any computable sequence _defined by an n-state Turing machine_. That last part is really important. (Note that my restatement is probably incorrect too, it is just correct enough to point out the important flaw I saw in your statement). This means that up-arrow^f(n) _can_ be larger than BB(n) \u2014 up-arrow^f(n) is not restricted by a Turing machine at all. As an easy example, consider f(n) = BB(n)^2.You may still be right about BB(7) being bigger than Graham\u2019s number, even if your proof is not bulletproofreply",
      "Math's a cooperative endeavor, I want to know if I'm wrong!I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're trying to make though, and I'm not sure it's right...The argument that BB has to grow faster than any computable sequence is that if we have a computable f(n) where for all n f(n) > BB(n) then we can solve the halting problem by simulating turing machines of size n for f(n) steps and checking if they halt. Even if we can't prove f(n) > BB(n) the mere existence of this f would mean we could solve the halting problem (even though we couldn't prove we had done so).I agree my \"proof\" (intuition really) rests on that assertion.",

      "Sure, but the example I'm providing is just meant to illustrate that BB(n) is not greater than arbitrary f(n). I'm not trying to provide the biggest number, I'm trying to illustrate that the sketched-out proof is incorrect. If you want me to provide a bigger number, I suppose another easy example is to define f(n) = BB(BB(n)).Edit: Oh sorry, I see I misread the direction of your greater than signs. Leaving comments as-is though, hopefully that results in the least confusionreply",

      "What makes BB(748) independent of ZFC is not its value, but the fact that one of the 748-state machines (call it TM_ZFC_INC) looks for an inconsistency (proof of FALSE) in ZFC and only halts upon finding one.Thus, any proof that BB(748) = N must either show that TM_ZF_INC halts within N steps or never halts. By G\u00f6del's famous results, neither of those cases is possible if ZFC is assumed to be consistent.reply",
      "I think what's most unintuitive is that most (all?) \"paradoxes\" or \"unknowables\" in mathematics involve infinities. When limiting ourselves to finite whole numbers, paradoxes necessarily disappear.BB(748) is by definition a finite number, and it has some value - we just don't know what it is. If an oracle told us the number, and we ran TM_ZFC_INC that many steps we would know for sure whether ZFC was consistent or not based on whether it terminated.The execution of the turing machine can be encoded in ZFC, so it really is the value of BB(748) that is the magic ingredient. Somehow even knowledge of the value of this finite number is a more potent axiomatic system than any we've developed.reply"

Also, the left-superscript means tetration, or iterated exponentiation: for example, 1510 means 10 to the 10 to the 10 and so on 15 times.By comparison, last "

Earlier, when we briefly lived in the Antelope Valley north of Los Angeles, the first computer I got to ever touch (albeit briefly) was a Texas Instruments 99/4A in the third grade classroom. Among other cartridges it had a brisk and zippy arcade conversion called Blasto from Milton Bradley which never got ported to any other system, and it wasn't until after college that I reacquainted myself with the TI version in emulation. I never actually got to put quarters in one.\n\n\n\nA shame, because by then we lived on the mean streets of east county San Diego, California \u2014 not far, it turns out, from the corporate office of Gremlin Industries where the original arcade incarnation of Blasto was developed (completely unrelated to the later PlayStation game).

      "If I may wax nostalgic for a moment:I got my original Novice license in 1990 I think (age 12). I was SO excited to participate in my local club\u2019s Field Day outing - but it was a nail biter for my physical license to arrive in the mail in time.I\u2019d somehow gotten the word from the FCC that my license was issued and I got my call sign (KB2NDR) but I was so worried it wouldn\u2019t get to my house in time for the weekend (and it didn\u2019t!) - but the club president was super chill and said \u201cI trust ya\u201d so he let me participate and I still remember every minute of that weekend to this day.It was my first full-fledged ham event (my first all-nighter too), sitting in the tents working on HF rigs I could only dream of affording at 3am with guys chain smoking cigars. They were probably chuffed at this nerdy 12 y/o who wanted to play along (minus the smoking bit).\u201c\u2026CQ Field Day CQ Field Day this is K2-Zed-O, K2-Zulu-Oscar\u2026\u201d(That weekend launched my short intensity but long lived ham life. Leveled up to Extra and I still have K2KD active today but haven\u2019t touched a radio in years)reply",
      "KA2PLF, similar, 12 or so, which would be 82 or so. Novice required code and only allowed code at the time. Took part in a few field days from locations up in the mountains in upstate NY where they threw pipes into a lake for ground and strung huge dipoles in the trees.reply",
      "Back in the early 90's, I worked with some guys that were in the San Jose State radio club, W6YL. Although Field Day is not a contest, these guys really really wanted to finish in the top 10 for class 2A.They found out that I had an Oscar 10/13 satellite station and begged me and my buddy to operate with them (there's bonus points for a satellite contact). So my buddy and I were \"hired guns\". We had never attended San Jose State and were not members of the club.These guys were definitely serious. We operated from a huge ranch in the Sunol hills and they erected wire beams for 80 and 40 meters. They did finish in the top 10 the two years my buddy and I participated.reply",
      "> They found out that I had an Oscar 10/13 satellite stationPersonally, or you had access to one? I am a hobbyist and amateur, so I don\u2019t know how significant this is, but I want to learn!reply",
      "I had the equipment. 2-meter SSB/CW receiver, 70cm SSB/CW transmitter, large 2-meter and 70cm yagi antennas and an azimuth/elevation rotator.Oscar 10 and 13 were amateur satellites in HEO (Molniya) orbit. They were super fun to operate since the passes lasted for hours.reply",
      "Did you have to do anything nonstandard to assist the team? I find the whole hobby rather interesting and want to get more into it. My grandparents\u2019 old C/Ku band receiver and giant dish led to discovering some trunk feeds and started my curiosity, but most of my radio work has involved WiFi. With WiFi, the use case and radios available without a license somewhat limited what I even thought to try.I guess I\u2019ll see if there is a local club I can join to meet some folks and see what they\u2019re doing.What did you normally use the equipment for, since you weren\u2019t in the club prior to your contact with the record breaking group?reply",
      "> Although Field Day is not a contest, these guys really really wanted to finish in the top 10 for class 2A.That\u2019s literally a contest. If the scoring was private maybe I\u2019d agree.Field Day may serve other purposes too, but it\u2019s a contest, if not purely so.reply",
      "It's certainly a contest for some groups, but I can't say what percentage that would be. There's many many groups that aren't even remotely competitive and for some groups it's primarily a social event.When we participated with W6YL, we had our own tent, food, and mass quantities of beer. Aside from folks stopping by the tent out of curiosity, it was not a social event at all.One guy who was a master CW operator wanted to see how the satellite worked. We hooked his keyer up to the 70cm transmitter and let him go at it. At first, hearing his own signal after a 250 millisecond delay confused him a little but I turned the receive audio down to help him out.reply",
      "This is a great time to be on the air especially if you're into late nights and enjoy setting up an outdoor station. Want to work all states? This is a good contest for it. It's my 2d favorite with the November CW Sweepstakes coming in first place.reply",
      "> This is a great time to be on the airActually it's not. It's just wall to wall QRM. You can't exactly setup on a single frequency and call CQ without some asshat setting up right on frequency.  \nI abhor Field Day because it's chaos. POTA, state QSO parties, 13 Colonies, Museum Ship Weekend, those are my speed.Most every ham club that sets up for Field Day talk like they're doing \"public service\" and \"outreach\", but then they post up at some obscure location quite a way away where most any 'public' would be. The scant visitors they get are either ignored or greeted in an overly excited way and then every old timer wants a chance to impress upon the visitor their view of radio which invariably runs off all but the most determined visitors who can see past all that. I've been to over a dozen different club field day events across the country and most of them are pretty cringy.---The best was Tucson almost 20 years ago because my wife and I happened to be tent camping on the same mountain peak where they were setup. She retired to the tent early, I played radio well into the night after the daytime RF pandemonium died down. In the morning one of the club members who also runs a restraunt made everyone omelettes to order on his catering flat top.One of the worst was Palm Springs RATS. Their setup was at their EOC and closed to the public. I had to essentially \"prove\" I was a ham to even be allowed in with them. (I told them my callsign but that wasn't enough. \"Hi. I'm <callsign> in town for work and thought I'd drop in to do Field Day with you guys.\" \"Do you know anyone here?\" \"No, I'm just in town for work.\" \"Well, this is a ham radio event.\" \"Yeah, it's Field Day. I'm just here for the week ahead and thought I'd come play radio with you guys.\" \"...and you're not a member?\")Some club in DC/Arlington was pretty awful too. Again, there for work. Two old timers took turns mansplaining ham radio to me most of my time there. Nevermind I was a 30-something dude and with-code Extra. I was on their \"get on the air\" station doing CW and they kept talking at me while I had headphones on copying callsigns and listening for a break in the pileup.These days I just don't even both going out because I've been disappointed so many times. Maybe I'll give it a go this evening to yet another new club's setup and see what new form of disappointment awaits.reply"

      "That reminds me of a three week, three person group project I had back when I was in university. There were a couple of topics we could pick from, including writing a very simple operating system from scratch. I asked the professors if we could instead port MINIX3 to the Raspberry Pi (given that it already had an ARM port to the BeagleBoard) and they accepted.What was supposed to be a reasonably straightforward project proved to be a huge challenge as we encountered numerous unforeseen technical difficulties. One particularly harrowing one was that the Raspberry Pi 3 booted into hypervisor mode instead of supervisor mode and QEMU's Raspberry Pi emulation accuracy was so abysmal back then to be borderline useless for osdev. I recall it took me an entire week of low-level hardware debugging just to figure that one out.By the end, we pulled through and delivered a working port with UART, GPIO and framebuffer drivers that could run on the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3. We run our presentation with the port on real hardware, using a shell script that displayed bitmaps from the ramdisk and monitored GPIO pins to move slides forwards or backwards (I used a knife to short-circuit the pins as needed). It was by far the coolest presentation of all the groups just on originality alone and I think I still have the image of that SD card somewhere.reply",

Teams grew unrealistically large with limited financial justification beyond cherry-picked growth metrics, and this meant a lot of companies lost the ability to innovate frugally or nimbly. Unrealistically high valuations also played a role because towards the end, founders could end up demanding IPO-sized multiples in private markets even without the underlying fundamentals (eg. Lacework's $9 BILLION valuation on what was at most $90 MILLION in revenue).A lot of the current AI products and stories are cost-competitive due to that bloat itself, so some amount of rightsizing will help the industry.reply",

      "> Everything is sent in cleat-text?From one Telnet lover to another, I'm still resentful folks blamed Telnet. Other application protocols built on TCP sockets are encouraged to use SSL/TLS e.g. HTTPS, SFTP, WSS (which is possibly HTTPS in a trenchcoat).My speculation is that it raised the barrier for entry. Artists and writers wanted to quickly build and share worlds. Most computers supported raw TCP sockets and most shells handled ANSI, so players could join without installing software.Today, people assume Telnet can't be secured and so they don't bother. Regrettably, I maintain some.There's a recent push for MUD hosts to deploy a WSS proxy. An example: The IRE MUDs have a login telnet subnegotiation which the web client performs over WSS. Credentials are no longer sent in plaintext nor stored in the application's command history. (Telnet does specify when inputs shouldn't be stored in hisotry, but it's on the client to respect.) IRE is a bit of a pooper here, they consider the WSS service private. Because the subnegotiation is nonstandard and WSS is discouraged, MUD clients are obligated to make bad choices.Other MUDs and engines are more forward. Evannia games support WS and Telnet and both can use SSL.So what MUDs are we playing?Edit to add: the tintin author, Scandum, is still at it.

      "Reminds me of PG-Strom[1] which is a Postgres extension for GPU-bound index access methods (most notably BRIN, select GIS functions) and the like; it relies on proprietary NVIDIA GPUDirect tech for peer-to-peer PCIe transactions between the GPU and NVMe devices. I'm not sure whether amdgpu kernel driver has this capability in the first place, and last I checked (~6 mo. ago) ROCm didn't have this in software.However, I wonder whether the GPU's are a good fit for this to begin with.Counterpoint: Xilinx side of the AMD shop has developed Alveo-series accelerators which used to be pretty basic SmartNIC platforms, but have since evolved to include A LOT more programmable logic and compute IP. You may have heard about these in video encoding applications, HFT, Blockchain stuff, what-have-you. A lot of it has to with AI stuff, see Versal[2]. Raw compute figures are often cited as \"underwhelming,\" and it's unfortunate that so many pundits are mistaking the forest for the trees here. I don't think the AI tiles in these devices are really meant for end-to-end LLM inference, even though memory bandwidth in the high-end devices allows it.The sauce is compute-in-network over fabrics.Similarly to how PG-Strom would feed the GPU with relational data from disk, or network directly, many AI teams on the datacenter side are now experimenting with data movement, & intermediate computations (think K/V cache management) over 100/200/800+G fabrics. IMHO, compute-in-network is the MapReduce of this decade. Obviously, there's demand for it in the AI space, but a lot of it lends nicely to the more general-purpose applications, like databases. If you're into experimental networking like that, Corundum[3] by Alex Forencich is a great, perhaps the best, open source NIC design for up to 100G line rate. Some of the cards it supports also expose direct-attach NVMe's over MCIO for latency, and typically have as many as two, or four SFP28 ports for bandwidth.This is a bit naive way to think about it, but it would have to do!Postgres is not typically considered to \"scale well,\" but oftentimes this is a statement about its tablespaces more than anything; it has foreign data[4] API, which is how you extend Postgres as single point-of-consumption, foregoing some transactional guarantees in the process. This is how pg_analytics[5] brings DuckDB to Postgres, or how Steampipe[6] similarly exposes many Cloud and SaaS applications. Depending on where you stand on this, the so-called alternative SQL engines may seem like moving in the wrong direction. Shrug.[1] https://heterodb.github.io/pg-strom/[2] https://xilinx.github.io/AVED/latest/AVED%2BOverview.html[3] https://github.com/corundum/corundum[4] https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers[5] https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics[6] https://hub.steampipe.io/#pluginsreply",
      "> However, I wonder whether the GPU's are a good fit for this to begin with.I think the GPU could be a great fit for OLAP, but when it comes to the nasty OLTP use cases the CPU will absolutely dominate.Strictly serialized transaction processing facilities demand extremely low latency compute to achieve meaningful throughput. When the behavior of transaction B depends on transaction A being fully resolved, there are no magic tricks you can play anymore.Consider that talking to L1 is at least 1,000x faster than talking to the GPU. Unless you can get a shitload of work done with each CPU-GPU message (and it is usually the case that you can), this penalty is horrifyingly crippling.reply",

      "Not necessarily! The setup I'm discussing is explicitly non-GPU, and it's not necessarily a TPU either. Any accelerator card with NoC capability will do: the requests are queued/batched from network, trickle through the adjacent compute/network nodes, and written back to network. This is what \"compute-in-network\" means; the CPU is never involved, main memory is never involved. You read from network, you write to network, that's it.
