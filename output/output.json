If you wanted to do something that couldn't be done with just HTML and CSS, you could usually find a way to do it with JS.And that is great! JS has helped push user experiences forward, and honestly helped push HTML and CSS forward!But as time marches on, and the HTML and CSS methods gain traction, we need to start replacing the old JS methods that feel so comfy with new methods that require less JS.Nothing against JS, but it has better things to do than setup and manage your accordions or offscreen navigation menus... Plus, JS needs to be downloaded, decompressed, evaluated, processed, and then often consumes memory to monitor and maintain features. If we can hand-off any JS functionality to native HTML or CSS, then users can download less stuff, and the remaining JS can pay attention to more important tasks that HTML and CSS can't handle (yet).Below are a few examples; any you"

Things like being able to handle states where transactions don't line up allowing for payments to eventually be settled. Or for telecom allowing for single parts of the system to not take down the whole thing or adding redundancy. Essentially these types of businesses require fault tolerance to be supported. The real world is messy, there is always going to be faults, so investing heavily into correctness may not be worth it compared to investing into fault tollerance.reply",

It makes sense why- OCaml and Haskell are functional and were early proponents of these type systems. But, languages like Racket don\u2019t have these type systems and the article doesn\u2019t do anything to explain why they are _also_ better for reliability.reply",
      "Thank you for saying that.  I regularly attend the International Conference on Functional Programming, which grew out of the LISP and Functional Programming conference.  Except for the Scheme Workshop, which is the reason I attend, it might as well be called the International Conference on Static Types.  Almost all of the benefits of functional programming come from functional programming itself, not from static types, but one would never get that impression from the papers presented there.  The types are all that anyone talks about.reply",
      "Yeah, I know Rust isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s favorite but I\u2019d expect at least some awareness that we\u2019ve seen a lot of reliability improvements due to many of these ideas in a language which isn\u2019t focused on FP. I ended up closing the tab when they had the example in TypeScript pretending the fix was result types rather than validation: that idea could be expressed as preferring that style, an argument that it makes oversights less likely, etc. but simply ignoring decades and decades of prior art suggests the author either isn\u2019t very experienced or is mostly motivated by evangelism (e.g. COBOL didn\u2019t suffer from the example problem before the first FP language existed so a far more interesting discussion would be demonstrating awareness of alternatives and explaining why this one is better).reply",

Reading the other comments to the effect that the conferences are now strong typing gabfests and insufficiently about FP per se reinforced this feeling.Reliability should be simpler with FP but so much depends on correctness of the runtime and IO.Erlang and the \"run correctly or die\" comes to mind as well. The system is either working or is off. When being off is fatal, Erlang seems to shrug and say \"maybe next karmic cycle\" maybe this too is a better approach?reply",

They are due to the code entering a state that should never have been possible. If you have been on call, you have seen variants of these:Functional programming helps by modeling the domain with types that make invalid states unrepresentable. Pure functions and immutability keep behavior predictable and testable.Product types combine fields, think \"and\". Sum types choose one of several cases, think \"or\".

I certainly want to get rid of gpg from my life if I can, but I also need to make sure commits/tags bearing my name actually come from me.reply",
      "One of those WONTFIX's is on an insane vulnerability: you can bitflip known plaintext in a PGP message to switch it into handling compression, allowing attackers to instruct GnuPG packet processing to look back to arbitrary positions in the message, all while suppressing the authentication failure message. GPG's position was: they print, in those circumstances, an error of some sort, and that's enough. It's an attack that reveals plaintext bytes!reply",
      "Are you referring to \"Encrypted message malleability checks are incorrectly enforced causing plaintext recovery attacks\"?Seems like a legitimate difference of opinion. The researcher wants a message with an invalid format to return an integrity failure message. Presumably the GnuPGP project thinks that would be better handled by some sort of bad format error.The exploit here is a variation on the age old idea of tricking a PGP user into decrypting an encrypted message and then sending the result to the attacker. The novelty here is the idea of making the encrypted message look like a PGP key (identity) and then asking the victim to decrypt the fake key, sign it and then upload it to a keyserver.Modifying a PGP message file will break the normal PGP authentication[1] (that was not acknowledged in the attack description). So here is the exploit:* The victim receives a unauthenticated/anonymous (unsigned or with a broken signature) message from the attacker. The message looks like a public key.* Somehow (perhaps in another anonymous message) the attacker claims they are someone the victim knows and asks them to decrypt, sign and upload the signed public key to a keyserver.* They see nothing wrong with any of this and actually do what the attacker wants ignoring the error message about the bad message format.So this attack is also quite unlikely. Possibly that affected the decision of the GnuPG project to not change behaviour in this case, particularly when such a change could possibly introduce other vulnerabilities.[1] https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:pgpauthAdded: Wait. How would the victim import the bogus PGP key into GPG so they could sign it? There would normally be a preexisting key for that user so the bogus key would for sure fail to import. It would probably fail anyway. It will be interesting to see what the GnuPG project said about this in their response.reply",
      "In the course of this attack, just in terms of what happens in the mechanics of the actual protocol, irrespective of the scenario in which these capabilities are abused, the attacker:(1) Rewrites the ciphertext of a PGP message(2) Introducing an entire new PGP packet(3) That flips GPG into DEFLATE compression handling(4) And then reroutes the handling of the subsequent real message(5) Into something parsed as a plaintext commentThis happens without a security message, but rather just (apparently) a zlib error.In the scenario presented at CCC, they used the keyserver example to demonstrate plaintext exfiltration. I kind of don't care. It's what's happening under the hood that's batshit; the \"difference of opinion\" is that the GnuPG maintainers (and, I guess, you) think this is an acceptable end state for an encryption tool.reply",
      "Is there a better alternative to GPG?reply",
      "Everything is better than PGP (not just GPG --- all PGP implementations).The problem with PGP is that it's a Swiss Army Knife. It does too many things. The scissors on a Swiss Army Knife are useful in a pinch if you don't have real scissors, but tailors use real scissors.Whatever it is you're trying to do with encryption, you should use the real tool designed for that task. Different tasks want altogether different cryptosystems with different tradeoffs. There's no one perfect multitasking tool.When you look at the problem that way, surprisingly few real-world problems ask for \"encrypt a file\". People need backup, but backup demands backup cryptosystems, which do much more than just encrypt individual files. People need messaging, but messaging is wildly more complicated than file encryption. And of course people want packet signatures, ironically PGP's most mainstream usage, ironic because it relies on only a tiny fraction of PGP's functionality and still somehow doesn't work.All that is before you get to the absolutely deranged 1990s design of PGP, which is a complex state machine that switches between different modes of operation based on attacker-controlled records (which are mostly invisible to users).

      "Few more additional ones, more about editing than just rendering:The style change mid ligature has a related problem. While it might be reasonable not to support style change in the middle of ligature, you still want to select individual letters within ligatures like \"ff\", \"ffi\" and \"fl\". The problem just like with color change is that neither the text shaper nor program rendering text knows where each individual letter within ligature glyph is positioned. Font simply lacks this information.From what I have seen most programs which support it use similar approximation as what Firefox uses for coloring - split the ligature into equal parts. Works good enough for something like \"fi\", \"fl\" not so much for some of ligatures within programming fonts that combine >= into \u2265.There are even worse edge cases in scripts for other languages. There are ligatures which look roughly like the 2 characters which formed it side by side but in reverse order. There are also some ligatures in CJK fonts which combine 4 characters in a square.Backspace erases characters at finer granularity than it's possible to select them.With regards to LTR/RTL selection weirdness I recently discovered that some editors display small flag on the cursor displaying current position direction when it's in mixed direction text.reply",

      "I highly recommend anyone to look up how PTP works and how it compares to NTP. Clock sync is very interesting. When I joined an HFT company, first thing I did was understand this stuff. We care about it a lot[1].If you want a specific question to answer, answer this: why does PTP need hardware timestamping to achieve high precision (where the network card itself assigns timestamps to packets, rather than having the kernel do it as part of TCP/IP processing)? If we use software timestamps, why can we do microsecond precision at best? If you understand this, it goes a very long way to understanding the core ideas behind precise clock sync.Once you have a solid understanding of PTP, look into White Rabbit. They\u2019re able to sync two clocks with sub-ns precision. In case that isn\u2019t obvious, that is absolutely insane.[1] So do a lot of people. For example audio engineers. Once, an audio engineer absolutely talked my ear off about ptp. I had no idea that audio people understood clock sync so well but they do!reply",
      "> When two transactions happen at nearly the same time on different nodes, the database must determine which happened first. If clocks are out of sync, the database might order them incorrectly, violating consistency guarantees.This is only true if you use wall clock time as part of your database\u2019s consistency algorithm. Generally I think this is a huge mistake. It\u2019s almost always much easier to swap to a logical clock - which doesn\u2019t care about wall time. And then you don\u2019t have to worry about ntp.The basic idea is this: event A happened before event B iff A (or something that happened after A) was observed by the node that generated B before B was generated. As a result, you end up with a dag of events - kind of like git. Some events aren\u2019t ordered relative to one another. (We say, they happened concurrently). If you ever need a global order for all events, you can deterministically pick an arbitrary order for concurrent events by comparing ids or something. And this will give you a total order that will be the same on all peers.If you make database events work like this, time is a little more complex. (It\u2019s a graph traversal rather than simple numbers). But as a result the system clock doesn\u2019t matter. No need to worry about atomic clocks, skew, drift, monotonicity, and all of that junk. It massively simplifies your system design.reply",

      "> I sometimes feel C and C++ were very clear on where data lives (stack vs heap) and how it\u2019s organized (struct alignment), while Rust seems a little more  opaque . I\u2019ve felt a similar way working in Go.This is interesting to me. I fully agree about this with Go (and in the past I've sometimes seen this make optimizations difficult as in practice it's hard to keep track of heap allocations other than runtime inspection), but I feel like Rust is actually better at C++ than this. Alignment is certainly a different beast, as by default I don't think you can really assume anything about how Rust will lay out a struct (with the workarounds being various `repr` attributes), but in terms of heap allocations, I'd argue there isn't anything as ambiguous as a raw C++ pointer. If you're able to get away with smart pointers all of the time, I could see this being less of an issue, but from my somewhat limited experience with C++ there seem to often be cases where APIs still expect raw pointers from time to time, so I wouldn't expect to be able to look at some random function call in a call graph and know what type of memory it's dealing with in the absence of documentation or runtime inspection.In Rust, it's a `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`, `Vec<T>`, or `String`, it's on the heap. If it's not, chances are it's on the stack. There are separate types for the non-owning versions of those types for references (`&T`), slices (`&[T]`), and string references (`&str)`, none of which require heap allocations to create (although they might indirectly refer to heap-allocated data in one of the other types mentioned before). There are probably other types that one might run into that are heap-allocated, but even when dealing with something like indirection from dynamic dispatch, any heap allocations needed to make things work will end up being explicit via something like `Box` or `Arc`. I might just be misunderstanding the point being made here; maybe the author was looking for documentation rather than relying on the types themselves, or maybe they had reason to be concerned about whether the type behind a reference or slice happened to be heap allocated or not, but in my experience, only needing to care about that in the context of when explicitly making a new allocation is a benefit, not a drawback.reply",

The VC shareholders and the employee shareholders are probably on equal footing and getting the same price. VCs will own preferred but I doubt that is enough to windfall them at the expense of the common shareholders.So if VCs are getting paid a certain share price, employees with vested stock almost certainly are getting the same price. And probably employees with vested options can either exercise now or will just get paid the net during the transaction.Yes, the company is probably doomed so people staying there are not doing well, but they also just got paid a 3x premium on their vested equity.reply",

      "i thought so at first, but I did some digging and changed my mind. it's possible the following is how it goes:- secondary transaction with the preferred shareholders (VCs) at some price that implies a 20b valuation- founders quit and get new employment agreements- some cash is transferred to the company as a license fee- no acquisition means no DOJ approvalin this scenario the headline can be $20b but the cash expense can be much lower, you have full flexibility to direct whatever cash or equity you want to founders vs the rest of the company, as an up front payment or as retention/salary, and the founders have no hinderance from working on anything they touched at previous company because of IP license.I actually bet this is how it went down.

      "Days since last ffmpeg CLI wrapper: 0It's incredible what lengths people go to to avoid memorizing basic ffmpeg usage. It's really not that hard, and the (F.) manual explains the basic concepts fairly well.Now, granted, ffmpeg's defaults (reencoding by default and only keeping one stream of each type unless otherwise specified) aren't great, which can create some footguns, but as long as you remember to pass `-c copy` by default you should be fine.Also, hiding those footguns is likely to create more harm than it fixes. Case in point: \"ff convert video.mkv to mp4\" (an extremely common usecase) maps to `ffmpeg -i video.mkv -y video.mp4` here, which does a full reencode (losing quality and wasting time) for what can usually just be a simple remux.Similarly, \"ffmpeg extract audio from video.mp4\" will unconditionally reencode the audio to mp3, again losing quality. The quality settings are also hardcoded and hidden from the user.I can sympathize with ffmpeg syntax looking complicated at first glance, but the main reason for this is just that multimedia is really complicated and that some of this complexity is necessary in order to not make stupid mistakes that lose quality or waste CPU resources. I truly believe that these ffmpeg wrappers that try to make it seem overly simple (at least when it's this simple, i.e. not even exposing quality settings or differentiating between reencoding and remuxing) are more hurtful than helpful. Not only can they give worse results, but by hiding this complexity from users they also give users the wrong ideas about how multimedia works. \"Abstractions\" like this are exactly how beliefs like \"resolution and quality are the same thing\" come to be. I believe the way to go should be educating users about video formats and proper ffmpeg usage (e.g. with good cheat sheets), not by hiding complexity that really should not be hidden.Edit: Reading through my comment again, I have to apologize for the slightly facetious opening statement, even if I quality it later on. The fact that so many ffmpeg wrappers exists is saying something about its apparent difficulty, but as I argue above, a) there are reasons for this (namely, multimedia itself just being complicated), and b) I believe there are good and bad ways to \"fix\" this, with oversimplified wrappers being more on the \"bad\" side.reply",

If an option is commonly used with another (or requires it), provide those hints (or automatically add the necessary values). If a value itself has structure (e.g. is itself a shell command), drill down recursively. Ensure that quotes and spaces and special characters always get escaped correctly.In other words, a general-purpose command-line builder. And while we're at it, be able to save particular \"templates\" for fast re-use, identifying which values should be editable in the future.I can't be the first person to think of this, but I've never come across anything like it and don't understand why not. It doesn't require AI or anything. Maybe it's the difficulty involved in creating the metadata for each tool, since man pages aren't machine-readable. But maybe that's where AI can help -- not in the tool itself, but to create the initial database of tool options, that can then be maintained by hand?(Navi [1] does the templating part, but not the \"interactive builder\" part.)[1] https://github.com/denisidoro/navireply"

      "Two things I like are:* HOT lanes in the Bay Area: they allocate demand efficiently and subsidize multi-people transport.

The highways were fast but you had to pay.Overall, I think fare at point of use is a great structure. In the past we couldn\u2019t enforce it but now we can do this for more things.The only problem is that we\u2019ve decided that impounding cars that don\u2019t have license plates or which have license plate covers is unacceptable because the poor do this most frequently. I hope we will clean up enforcement and then we will have the right incentives here.reply",

It encourages people to abandon all sorts of social contracts.reply",

      "The review shows ARM64 software support is still painful vs x86. For $200 for the 16gb model, this is the price point where you could just get an Intel N150 mini PC in the same form factor. And those usually come with cases. They also tend to pull 5-8w at idle, while this is 15w. Cool if you really want ARM64, but at this end of the performance spectrum, why not stick with the x86 stack where everything just works a lot easier?reply",
      "From the article: \"[...] the Linux support for various parts of the boards, not being upstreamed and mainlined, is very likely to be stuck on an older version. This is usually what causes headaches down the road [...]\".The problem isn't support for the ARM architecture in general, it's the support for this particular board.Other boards like the Raspberry Pi and many boards based on Rockchip SoCs have most of the necessary support mainlined, so the experience is quite painless. Many are starting to get support for UEFI as well.reply",
      "There's also a risk of your DeviceTree getting pruned from the kernel in X years when it's decided that \"no one uses that board anymore\", which is something that's happened to several boards I bought in the 2010's, but not something that's happened to any PC I've ever owned.reply",
      "The exception (even those are questionable as running plain Debian did not work right on Pi 3B and others when I tried recently) proves the rule. You have to look really hard to find an x86 computer where things don't just basically work, the reverse is true for ARM. The power draw between the two is comparable these days, so I don't understand why anyone would bother with ARM when you've got something where you need more than minimally powerful hardware.reply",
      "The Pi 3B doesn't have UEFI support, so it requires special support on the distro side for the boot process but for the 4 and newer you can flash (or it'll already be there, depending on luck and age of the device) the firmware on the board to support UEFI and USB boot, though installing is a bit of a pain since there's no easy images to do it with.  https://wiki.debian.org/RaspberryPi4I believe some other distros also have UEFI booting/installers setup for PI4 and newer devices because of this, though there's a good chance you'll want some of the other libraries that come with Raspberry PI OS (aka Raspbian) still for some of the hardware specific features like CSI/DSI and some of the GPIO features that might not be fully upstreamed yet.There's also a port of Proxmox called PXVirt (Formerly Proxmox Port) that exists to use a number of similar ARM systems now as a virtualization host with a nice ui and automation around it.reply",
      "So, I agree but less than I did a few months ago. I purchased an Orange Pi 5 Ultra and was put off by the pre-built image and custom kernel. The \u201cpatch\u201c for the provided kernel was inscrutable as well. Now I\u2019m running a vanilla 6.18 kernel on a vanilla uboot firmware (still a binary blob required to build that though) with a vanilla install of Debian. That support includes the NPU, GPU, 2.5G Ethernet and NVMe root/boot. I don\u2019t have performance numbers but it\u2019s definitely fast enough for what I use it for.reply",
      "Interesting, where did you get an image with a 6.18 kernel that has NPU support?reply",
      "My uninformed normie view of the ecosystem suggests that it's the support for almost every particular board, and that's exactly the issue. For some reason, ARM devices always have some custom OS or Android and can't run off-the-shelf Linux. Meanwhile you can just buy an x86/amd64 device and assume it will just work. I presume there is some fundamental reason why ARM devices are so bad about this? Like they're just missing standardization and every device requires some custom firmware to be loaded by the OS that's inevitably always packaged in a hacky way?reply",
      "Its the kernel drivers, not firmware. There is no bios or acpi, so the kernel itself has to support a specifc board. In practice it means there is a dtb file that configures it and the actual drivers in the kernel.Manufacturers hack it together, flash to device and publish the sources, but dont bother with upstreaming and move on.Same story as android devices not having updates two years after release.reply",
      "But \"no BOIS or ACPI\" and requiring the kernel to support each individual board sounds exactly like the problem is the ARM architecture in general. Until that's sorted it makes sense to be wary of ARM.reply"

      "This is subscriber-walled, but the full article is available here:https://web.archive.org/web/20240909093450/https://www.statn...The key reason Pfizer passed was that executives didn't think patients would accept a new therapy that required injection to administer:Despite our emerging results, the Pfizer executives in charge of research and external alliances told us the company did not want to develop a new diabetes therapy that required injection, a space held exclusively by insulin since 1922. They gave us a year to find a way to deliver GLP-1 via transnasal, transcutaneous, or oral administration. Effective delivery by any of these approaches would have been great, but we knew success was unlikely in the year they gave us. Our effort was predictably unsuccessful, and after four years, Pfizer terminated our agreement as permitted under the alliance contract.The first commercial GLP-1 receptor agonist, Exenatide, went to market as an injectable medication in 2005 [1]. Orally delivered GLP-1 medications didn't come to market until 2019 when orally dosed semaglutide was approved as Rybelsus [2].Now that injected GLP-1 drugs are among the most-prescribed drugs in America, I wonder if drug company executives are going to be more receptive to drug candidates that require injections. There are a lot of molecules (especially peptides) that are degraded by the digestive system; maybe people will be more willing to inject medications when so many have started self-injecting for GLP-1 drugs or know someone who has.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exenatide[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide#Legal_statusreply",
      "FWIW, Novo Nordisk also tried to kill their GLP-1 effort several times according to the project lead, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen: https://archive.is/oLnBlIn large organizations, I guess a big chunk of success comes from being able to navigate all these political ups and downs.reply",

      "The proprietary injector mechanism like for Mounjaro makes it really easy for users. Even compounded versions of it use tiny insulin needles that have near zero pain when injected into the subcutaneous portion of like the stomach while pinched.Source: I took compounded Mounjaro and compounded Ozempic/semaglutide.reply",
      "Do you still take it? I'm looking for some more information on compounded GLP-1 and their safety.reply",
      "I stopped taking compound Mounjaro a year ago. I started semaglutide in Sept and stopped because it made me sick (throwing up, other non desirable GI effects). My body couldn\u2019t handle semaglutide.reply",
      "It really helps that the needles are hair-thin and short.reply",
