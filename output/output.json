      "Not sure the dial-up analogy fits, instead I tend to think we are in the mainframe period of AI, with large centralised computing models that are so big and expensive to host, only a few corporations can afford to do so. We rent a computing timeshare from them (tokens = punch cards).I look forward to the \"personal computing\" period, with small models distributed everywhere...reply",
      "> I look forward to the \"personal computing\" period, with small models distributed everywhere...One could argue that this period was just a brief fluke. Personal computers really took off only in the 1990s, web 2.0 happened in the mid-2000s. Now, for the average person, 95%+ of screen time boils down to using the computer as a dumb terminal to access centralized services \"in the cloud\".reply",
      "> using the computer as a dumb terminal to access centralized services \"in the cloud\"Our personal devices are far from thin clients.reply",
      "Depends on the app, and the personal device.  Mobile devices are increasingly thin clients.  Of course hardware-wise they are fully capable personal computers, but ridiculous software-imposed limitations make that increasingly difficult.reply",
      "But that is what they are mostly used for.",
      "I don't know, I think you're conflating content streaming with central compute.Also, is percentage of screentime the relevant metric?  We moved TV consumption to the PC, does that take away from PCs?Many apps moved to the web but that's basically just streamed  code to be run in a local VM.  Is that a dumb terminal?  It's not exactly local compute independent...reply",
      "That 'average' is doing a lot of work to obfuscate the landscape.  Open source continues to grow (indicating a robust ecosystem of individuals who use their computers for local work) and more importantly, the 'average' looks like it does not necessarily due to a reduction in local use, but to an explosion of users that did not previously exist (mobile first, SAAS customers, etc.)The thing we do need to be careful about is regulatory capture.  We could very well end up with nothing but monolithic centralized systems simply because it's made illegal to distribute, use, and share open models.  They hinted quite strongly that they wanted to do this with deepseek.There may even be a case to be made that at some point in the future, small local models will outperform monoliths - if distributed training becomes cheap enough, or if we find an alternative to backprop that allows models to learn as they infer (like a more developed forward-forward or something like it), we may see models that do better simply because they aren't a large centralized organism behind a walled garden.  I'll grant that this is a fairly polyanna take and represents the best possible outcome but it's not outlandishly fantastic - and there is good reason to believe that any system based on a robust decentralized architecture would be more resilient to problems like platform enshittification and overdeveloped censorship.At the end of the day, it's not important what the 'average' user is doing, so long as there are enough non-average users pushing the ball forward on the important stuff.reply",
      "I can't imagine a universe where a small mind with limited computing resources has an advantage against a datacenter mind, no matter the architecture.reply",
      "I don't want to send sensitive information to a data center, I don't want it to leave my machine/network/what have you. Local models can help in that department.You could say the same about all self-hosted software, teams with billions of dollars to produce and host SaaS will always have an advantage over smaller, local operations.reply",
      "The small mind could have an advantage if it is closer or more trustworthy to users.It only has to be good enough to do what we want. In the extreme, maybe inference becomes cheap enough that we ask \u201cwhy do I have to wake up the laptop\u2019s antenna?\u201dreply"

You\u2019ll find that the 401(k) dashboard and user experience remain familiar. If you\u2019ve set up your account, your same login credentials will provide you access into the dashboard. (Please note, Accrue does not currently offer a mobile app).The my.accrue401k.com part was a hyperlink to that site.

Asking someone to enter their financial account credentials into a site they've never used or heard of, based entirely on an unsolicited email, is INSANE.This email was the first time I've heard of Gusto, of Guideline being acquired, or of Accrue 401k (which apparently is the company created to hold Guideline's 401k accounts that are NOT affiliated with Gusto).

So, I have nowhere to move the 401k funds besides an IRA account, but I have to leave my traditional IRA accounts empty so that I can do a backdoor contribution.I wish the federal government would just get rid of the salary cap for direct contributions to a Roth IRA, since they basically already allow it via the obnoxious and convoluted path.reply",

      "The way to understand Arthur Whitney's C code is to first learn APL (or, more appropriately, one of his languages in the family). If you skip that part, it'll just look like a weirdo C convention, when really he's trying to write C as if it were APL. The most obvious of the typographic stylings--the lack of spaces, single-character names, and functions on a single line--are how he writes APL too. This is perhaps like being a Pascal programmer coming to C and indignantly starting with \"#define begin {\" and so forth, except that atw is not a mere mortal like us.reply",
      "It looks like a weirdo C convention to APLers too though. Whitney writes K that way, but single-line functions in particular aren't used a lot in production APL, and weren't even possible before dfns were introduced (the classic \"tradfn\" always starts with a header line). All the stuff like macros with implicit variable names, type punning, and ternary operators just doesn't exist in APL. And what APL's actually about, arithmetic and other primives that act on whole immutable arrays, is not part of the style at all!reply",

      "Would learning J work instead?It\u2019s probably more accessible than APL since its symbols can be found on conventional keyboards.reply",
      "Every time I read about APL, I'm reminded of Lev Grossman's \"The Magicians\" \u2014 I'm always imagining some keyboard with just a little bit more than two dimensions; and, with sufficient capabilities, I could stretch to hit the meta-keys that let me type APL directly on my modified split MTGAP keyboard.reply",
      "We know, the beginning of the article tells us his C code is APL-inspired. So many comments that just summarize the article on a surface level.reply",
      "Yes, but... even if you know that it is APL inspired, that does not change the fact that this is not how you want to write C.The C pre-processor is probably one of the most abused pieces of the C toolchain and I've had to clean up more than once after a 'clever' programmer left the premises and their colleagues had no idea of what they were looking at. Just don't. Keep it simple, and comment your intent, not what the code does. Use descriptive names. Avoid globally scoped data and functions with side effects.That doesn't look smart and it won't make you look smart, but it is smart because the stuff you build will be reliable, predictable and maintainable.reply",
      "The beginning of the article talks about not learning APL--specifically mentions that he's not here to talk about APL--and proceeds into a wide-eyed dissection of the C without mentioning APL syntax again. It also doesn't, literally, say that the C is like APL; it says Arthur is an APL guy who writes weird C code. Another comment disagrees that this is APL style at all--which is it?? I think you could have given me more credit than this. I read the article and participated as best I could. I'm always happy to bump APL related articles so they get more visibility.reply"

      "Could lead to significant efficiency gains for EV's, because 1/4 of the motor weight means better power-to-weight ratio... a lot of things will automatically get better.YASA was founded in 2009, a spin out from Oxford University following the PhD of founder and still CTO, Dr Tim Woolmer.\"Over the decades that followed both of these technologies were explored. But despite the potential for weight reduction, smaller size, shorter axle length and increased torque, it was the difficulty in manufacturing the axial flux technology that limited its commercial viability, because the motor could not be made by stacking laminations, as with radial machines.\"\"The breakthrough innovation came by segmenting the axial flux motor in discrete \"pole-pieces\", so the motor could be manufactured using Soft Magnetic Composite material.SMC can be pressed at low cost into a wide variety of 3D shapes. This removed the need for the complex laminations, overcoming the major manufacturing challenge of the axial flux machine.\"\"In 2025, after a \u00a312m investment, YASA opened the UK's first axial-flux super factory, in Oxfordshire.The opening of this facility boosts YASA\u2019s manufacturing capacity, setting new benchmarks in e-motor technology and quality, and enabling production to scale beyond 25,000 units per year.\"This is awesome.

      "> Could lead to significant efficiency gains for EV's, because 1/4 of the motor weight means better power-to-weight ratio... a lot of things will automatically get better.EV motors are already lightweight. The electric motor in a vehicle like a Tesla Model 3 already weighs less than you do. Reducing that one component by 75% would be a weight savings equivalent to about a half of a passenger.Not a significant efficiency improvement for vehicles that weigh over 3000lbs (or double that for many EVs).Every little bit helps, but this isn\u2019t a game changer.reply",
      "This, or a miniaturized version thereof could change the game for light electric vehicles - \nimagine an electric motorcycle that weighs substantially more like an electric bicycle.Right now it takes about 10-15lbs of motor to produce a 3KW motor for an electric bike, this motor is about 10 times that in power density afaict.The Livewire electric motorcycles use something like 100-200 lbs of motor to produce 1/4 as much power, 75kw, so that\u2019s an improvement of 8-16x.reply",
      "Does this motor design scale down?  It's not clear from the article - the article focuses more on the relative efficiency gains over the previous model.A 30lb 1000hp motor doesn't necessarily mean that they can also produce a 3lb, 100hp motor.  It would be cool if it did, but I doubt that it does because usually component strength doesn't scale linearly.That being said, these are still valuable for traditional EVs.  Even if they are only a modest weight savings in the grand scheme of modern vehicle weight, their ability to improve packaging options will be a boon. One thing the industry has dicovered is that the generic \"skateboard\" platform doesn't make for the best vehicles, in terms of packaging.reply",

      "It's interesting that none of the programs commonly known as \"terminal emulators\" actually emulate a terminal.. we can do that now though. https://zork.net/~st/jottings/Real-VT102-emulation-with-MAME...I would avoid doing the PTY thing and instead do this (works on WSL if MAME is the windows version):    $ sudo socat TCP-LISTEN:1234,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:\"/sbin/agetty -L - 9600 vt102\",pty,setsid,ctty,stderr\n    $ mame -nomouse vt102 -rs232 null_modem -bitb socket.localhost:1234\n\nYou can do the same thing with a vt220.I've had an idea to try to write a sort of high-level-ish VT220 emulator that pokes and patches the ROMs and the system to let you control it with the mouse, paste and stuff, lets you just doubleclick it to get a terminal, etc... I forgot about that until seeing this. Nobody would use it for more than 5 minutes but it would be funny.reply",
      "If MAME could support the VT525 (nearly the last terminal DEC made and unlike the previous DEC models it supports ANSI color) people might use it a bit more. It would be very useful for compatibility testing as there aren't many people with a real VT525! Last I looked someone had dumped the ROMs but there wasn't any support code.reply",
      "Work had me using the Windows Terminal for the first time ever after a life of developing on Linux. I got immediately hooked on the smart Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V (without needing to use Shift like on Linux!)For those not knowing, Windows Terminal uses Ctrl+C to abort the current process (as we'd expect) when nothing is selected, but copies when there is a selection. Similarly, Ctrl+V just pastes. So convenient!reply",
      "In Linux (Wayland) you can copy text from the terminal without pressing Ctrl+C at all. Just select the text. To paste it in another Window, press the middle mouse button.This is called the Primary Selection and is separate from the Clipboard (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V).

      "Agreed. It's nice to be able to just use the provided terminal when running KDE. It's very customisable and runs plenty fast. I also love being able to right click on Dolphin and tell it to open Konsole in the current folder. Also, I leave infinite scroll back turned on in Konsole and it works really well, swapping out to a file as it gets too much scroll back. Nothing worse than getting errors that I can't read because the terminal discarded them. I have Ctrl+Shift+X bound to clear everything, which I use before running just about any operation.reply",
      "I appreciate this analysis is on the state of terminal emulators, but I'm curious how well the integrated terminals that come bundled in code editors/IDEs also perform.

AOR agents execute across a distributed cluster, whether one node or thousands.- Deployment and scaling: Koog provides no deployment or scaling mechanisms. That's something you need to figure out on your own. AOR includes built-in deployment, updating, and scaling.- Integration complexity: Koog must be combined with other tools (monitoring tool, databases, deployment tools, etc.) to approximate a complete agent platform. AOR is fully integrated, including built-in high-performance, durable storage for any data model.- Experimentation and evaluation: Koog has no features for experimentation or online evaluation. AOR includes extensive support for both.- Scalability: AOR scales horizontally for both computation and storage. With Koog, you'd need to design and operate that infrastructure yourself.- Observability: Koog's observability is limited to traces and basic telemetry exposed via OpenTelemetry. AOR provides a much broader set of telemetry, including \"time to first token\" and online evaluation charts. You can also split all time-series charts automatically by any metadata you attach to your runs (e.g. see how agent latency differs by the choice of model used). Plus, it's all built-in and automatic.Please correct me if I'm wrong on any aspect of Koog.reply"

It would be amazing to have you join the project :) https://a5geo.org/ https://github.com/felixpalmer/a5reply",
      "Ha, yeah, I remember reading about your project back in April (I think someone shared it on the GeoRust Discord).\nReally cool stuff you have here!Can't say I understand all the math behind it, as it's not my forte (even for H3, for the more numerical parts, I rely on the work of the original authors: I could never have come up with this myself), but your doc is really great!For the follow-up article, I hope I can get to it eventually.\nBut spare time is a rare currency ^^reply",
      "h3o-zip is really impressive! I've been wanting to play around with it more, and I've been meaning to ask you if you have any good references for that encoding approach. I understand how it works in h3o-zip, but I'd be interested to know more about where else that approach has been used.reply",
      "H3o is an awesome piece of work. I created polars bindings for it(another reason I love polars) and last time I benchmarked it, it had 5X better performance than even duckdb\u2019s C++ implementation.https://github.com/Filimoa/polars-h3reply",
      "I really want to do a DuckDB extension someday, I think it would be pretty cool. I had looked into it 2 years ago but didn't dig further.Now that H3 provides one, maybe I should take another look at it.reply",
      "TIL! What are the advantages of hexagonal spatial indexing compared to e.g. quad trees, r-trees?reply",
      "The main advantages of hexagons are that the distance to each neighbour is always the same, and the distortion across the globe is much less, because of the way H3 creates its grid (compared to the earlier Google S2 which uses squares and distorts a lot). There\u2019s an excellent Uber blog post about this, I\u2019ll see if I can find the link.reply",
      "(here\u2019s the blog post: https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/h3/ )reply",
      "The main advantage of hexagonal spherical tiling systems is that they are roughly equal area at a given resolution. This makes them particularly suitable for generating visualizable aggregates when you primarily care about spatial distribution rather than specific boundaries (like borders).The main disadvantage of non-congruent tiling systems like H3 is poor scalability and performance when running analytical computations. In most cases you wouldn't want to shard your underlying data this way even if this is how you want to visualize it.It is easy to get the best of both worlds. You can shard data models as 3-space spherical embeddings (efficient for large-scale analytic computation) and convert query results to an H3 tiling at wire speed on demand.reply"

      "When I was around 15, I used to hang out with a guy who was much senior to me, and he would bully us sometimes. One day, when we were bantering, I cracked a joke that a third guy with us (who was my age) found funny and crackled. The bully grabbed my neck and choked me till I lost consciousness. I remember having memory flashbacks related to missing a train, and someone waiting at the wagon door, waving at me to hurry and jump in before it is too late. I remember feeling stressed about missing the train. The next thing I remember is slowly regaining consciousness to see the bully and the 3rd guy splashing water at my face, looking very amused.reply",
      "I'm sorry that happened to you. That's so horrible. Wanna make me beat up bullies, man. Got damn bullies.reply",
      "I do have dreams of beating up bullies. Count me in.reply",
      "Their life is shit already, that's why they act as they act, passing aggression on to others in vain effort to get rid of some of that 'evil' in them.I understand this knee-jerk reaction very well, but it just feeds the neverending spiral of aggression. We humans act like storage of both good and bad, it then comes back up in various situations.What I want to say - you just beating up a bully will mean some other kid(s) will get beaten up (or beaten up even more) further down the line. I am not saying love can fix it all, it can fix many things but sometimes once people become broken they just stay broken and there is no real way back.reply",
      "IIRC this is a misconception and bullies bully strategically to climb the social ladder and benefit from it.It's possible that they do it because they learned pathological systems of behaviour from pathological family/social experiences, but even if fighting back against them is also shitty, it beats enabling them to keep doing it (especially to you)reply",
      "No, that is absolutely not a misconception, and is backed by peer reviewed research such as https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/why-stigmatized-ado....What you may be thinking of is research showing that when kids get to know each other, the ones who will become socially dominant tend to be aggressive early. But once they achieve social status, they usually turn around and become far nicer. With further aggression limited to those who have not accepted their dominance.The most common scenario for continued aggression is someone near the social bottom, who is attempting to reinforce that there is someone who is still firmly below them.reply",
      "I have zero faith that a sociology paper will hold up to scrutiny, nor demonstrate causality. Bonus points for Harvard.reply",
      "Could you _be_ more condescending?reply",
      "What is stopping you from beating up bullies every time they bully others as well?reply",
      "The study seems to use self-reported perception of being a bully as the main metric. They didn't even bother making the children rate each other.> But once they achieve social status, they usually turn around and become far nicerThis sounds to me that their (unprovoked) aggression worked and that counter-aggression should have been encouraged earlier to make it a less viable strategy.---This also does not describe any kind of bullying I've seen or heard about. It was always those with a high social status, usually a group, though often with a clear leader, targeting one or two children with a low social status.Some of this bullying was not even driven by the need to gain social status but simple pleasure - see my other comments - pleasure/amusement/entertainment is a major reason for bullying.I've literally never seen a low-social status child bully a high-social status one. How would that even work? Wouldn't the supposed target be defended by his group?reply"
