      "As much as I love Bazzite at end of the day it's still a custom distro and every single day there is a chance they just close the project down and move on. Happened to so many distros in the past, this is not out of question. I\u2019m not saying \u201cbig corporate\u201d distros are better but personally I'd rather stick to something more mainline.Hopefully Valve will release a general version of SteamOS with Steam Machine coming (and even they are questionable with their track record)reply",
      "Hi, I'm the founder.While what you're saying isn't impossible, it's unlikely. In the event it did happen, Bazzite is a fork, a signing key, and a couple forked Fedora Copr repos away from being made completely in someone else's control.reply",
      "I don't doubt it, but I actually really hate that the build system is a bunch of bash scripts, github actions and assuming the previous stage builds fine. Especially when the custom image forkable repo has an action commented out to squeeze more temporary storage out of GHA hosted runners because some images don't even fit on those (like the gnome-deck). I wish the entire setup was a little more decoupled and maybe allowed you to build multiple stages in one go so the entire system was more \"forkable\" and less spread out. I went on a bit of a wild goose chase trying to build Bazzite without the Firefox RPM removed (rpm-ostree doesn't like adding and removing and then adding packages again).I did voice that concern in some Bazzite-related spaces before and it felt like it got brushed off with a weird undertone.reply",
      "Always a possibility with any distro, but the tooling around it is flexible and repeatable. If another group of people wanted to continue off where they left off it would be far more possible than a lot of the Ubuntu forks.Just need the Atomic Fedora base to still be around and everything else is already pre-setup to run on GitHub infrastructure neither of which I anticipate going away soon. (Famous last words)Calling it a superset of Fedora rather than just being its own bespoke distro can be a fine line, but really there's nothing stopping anyone from forking it and continuing on, a good few people run their own forks already to meet their own needs a bit more specifically.reply",
      "Bazzite is a part of the Universal Blue family, which is more of a repackaging of Fedora Atomic.I'm a fan of my Steam Deck and SteamOS, but I'd like that experience to eventually be available via community supported distros, which Valve/Igalia can rebase from, and instead focus on Proton.Bazzite is the closest to that that we have so far.reply",
      "What you just said is the reason ehy I use Ubuntu for my company and not something else. It is about risk of lack of support obviously.reply",
      "SteamOS is only going to support other hardware by coincidence. Valve is unlikely to put in resources beyond the hardware that they want to support. It's also unlikely to change the whole \"firmware restore, entire drive\" approach. They're not going to put in the resources or support work into making and maintaining a full distro by themselves.A community distro (be it a console-like gaming focused distro or not) is going to be the way to be the way to go for the foreseeable future. I'm pretty happy with running EndeavorOS w/ KDE, Steam, and Heroic. The Steam client with Proton is where most of the magic happens in Linux anyway. If I wanted to get fancy, I could set up GameScope with Steam Big Picture to take a SteamOS/Bazzite approach.reply",
      "I don\u2019t see why Valve wouldn\u2019t try to support lots of hardware. Small time outfits like CachyOS can do it, why wouldn\u2019t they? I think their motive with the Steam Box is hardware sales. It seems like they\u2019re trying to shift the gaming ecosystem away from Windows.reply",
      "Probably for the same reason they don't support every Arch package on the Steam Deck out-of-the-box; it breaks easily and it's not their job to fix it.Additionally, I think Valve doesn't want to end up over-committed to replacing Windows. They can handle the storefront side and do a decent job with handling the runtime, but actually committing to a desktop alternative to Windows would be spreading their resources thin. It feels like a smart call to not jump into that arena if your hardware products don't need it.reply",
      "Sadly SteamOS doesn't support full disk encryption, which is inexcusable for an OS used on a portable device, that some also use to remote access their desktop (through Steam Link/Moonlight).reply"

      "What's the status of Landlock in container runtimes? A quick search makes it seem like CRIs are trying to define their own custom Landlock interface.That will inevitably lag behind what the kernel supports, but more importantly I don't foresee many container image packagers, Helm recipe maintainers and other YAML wranglers getting into the business of maintaining a Landlock sandbox policy.It makes sense for an application to use Landlock directly to sandbox some parser or other sensitive component. But if the CRI just blocks the syscalls by default, no infra person is going to take on the maintainance of their own sandbox policy for every app. The app will just see ENOSYS and not be sandboxed.I might be missing the whole idea here, but I really don't see why we need some custom layer in the middle instead of having container runtimes let the security syscalls through?reply",
      "I am puzzled by this:> A official c library doesn\u2019t exist yet unfortunately, but there\u2019s several out there you can try.> Landlock is a Linux Security Module (LSM) available since Linux 5.13Since when is not a C API the first and foremost interface for developers when it comes to Linux kernel stuff?reply",
      "The first and foremost interface of the kernel is the syscall interface aka the uapi. libc and other C libraries like liburing or libcap are downstream of that. Many syscalls still don't have wrappers in libc after years of use.reply",
      "Thanks for clarification! I meant more, why isn't there a C API first, but Rust, Haskell, and Go before that \u2014 that's kind of surprising or new to me.reply",
      "I read the article as saying that there's no official C library but unofficial ones do exist. Quote below, emphasis mine.> A official c library doesn\u2019t exist yet unfortunately, but there\u2019s several out there you can try.Also, it looks like there is more than zero support for C programs calling Landlock APIs. Even without a 3rd-party library you're not just calling syscall() with a magic number:https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.htmlhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/6bda50f4/include/uapi...https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/6bda50f4/include/linu...reply",
      "I don't understand what you mean. There's no \"official\" Rust, Haskell and Go APIs for this thing either. All libraries available seem to be just what some third party made available. There's also several C libraries, just none that have been officially endorsed by the Linux kernel team.reply",
      "Go is famous for not needing libc and talking to the kernel. Rust and Haskell have communities that are very interested in safety and security, so they are earlier adopters.For C, unofficial support apparently sufficed for now.reply",
      "The lack of a C API should not stop any C developers from using it, hopefully. The wrapper libraries are relatively simple (i.e. https://codeberg.org/git-bruh/landbox) and both Rust and Go can expose a C FFI in case developers would rather link against a more \"official\" library instead.The Linux kernel has a relatively simple example on how to use the syscall even if you can't find a library to deal with it for you: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/lin...There is no \"liblandlock\" or whatever, though there totally could be. The only reason Rust, Go, and Haskell have an easy-to-use API for this syscall is because someone bothered to implement a wrapper and publish it to the usual package managers. Whatever procedure distros use to add new libraries could just as easily be used to push a landlock library/header to use it in C.reply",
      "I use this and have no problems with it: https://github.com/marty1885/landlock-unveilreply",
      "Interesting they added new syscalls, instead of handling configuration via /sys like with SELinux and AppArmor. I suppose it must be because of the no privilege principle.Can sysadmins disable access to Landlock syscalls via seccomp? Not that I can see why they'd want to, just wondering how this is layered.I suppose the problem might be if the system has been set up at some earlier point in time to whitelist a set of syscalls for a process and, as Landlock is newer, its syscall numbers won't be included. A program that has been updated to use Landlock while a seccomp policy that predates Landlock is applied would presumably be terminated with SIGSYS due to this?How can a program determine if Landlock is present without just trying the syscalls and seeing if they work?reply"

      "Quite the opposite: clippy was useless but not hostile which is a sobering contrast to software that is hostile and therefore worse than useless.It's a cute nostalgic way to say \"the bar was on the floor and you blew it anyway.\"reply",
      "Clippy was definitely hostile. It would constantly monitor user actions just so that it could interrupt us. Wasted CPU cycles and our time when CPUs weren't very fast. Clippy was hated by everyone. It was not just useless. It was intrusive, wasteful, and hostile. I can't believe my eyes that anyone could think that Clippy is an appropriate mascot for anything good. If anything, Clippy would be a perfect mascot for the trillion dollar companies that exploit our data.reply",
      "Is there such a thing as anti-rose-tinted glasses? I feel like this is an example of that.No one here is saying that Microsoft was good, which seems to underlie your insistence on Clippy being so horrible - they're saying that a mistake like this one wasn't born from anti-user sentiment. Microsoft had engaged in plenty of anti-consumer action by then, but Clippy wasn't an example of it - its inclusion was misguided because the software industry was still in the exploratory phase in terms of UX, and some designers thought that putting silly faces and characters on things would make computers easier to learn and use in the rapidly-expanding market. Which is why you also see less annoying forms of character images pop up in some other Microsoft software of the day, acting as flashier textboxes.They didn't purposefully waste CPU time by disregarding good software engineering practices (like what's happening everywhere now), they just misplaced a part of the performance budget to something that wasn't very useful. They didn't integrate Clippy as an essential part of the Microsoft experience, making it uplink your actions to Microsoft (which could have been done by then) or making Windows into the \"Clippy OS\". It was just an interactive help pop-up. If you didn't want it, you could have unchecked it from the very first version's install dialogue, and it would never appear anywhere. You could disable it afterwards. After a short run, Microsoft admitted their mistake and removed this feature for good, even making fun of it in a few Flash shorts and games. Nothing from this list even remotely approaches what Microsoft does today, and they will never return to the already-low-bar that was there 20 years ago.reply",

      "You\u2019re both making similar points I think. It was \u201cbad\u201d - for all the reasons you mention, but back then it was done seemingly to try to add functionality that people wanted, it was just shitty, and that was as bad as it gets.Now nothing is done even remotely to try and help the customer. Every feature and every stupid \u201cnudge\u201d is done with pure malice, as the thinnest possible pretext to extract more information, more ad revenue, etc. from the user.Clippy sucked, it would be nice if it still represented the worst kind of corporate shenanigans, but now it\u2019s benign and naive compared to the evil rapaciousness arrayed against us by virtually all modern software.reply",
      "So my point stands doesn't it? If Clippy was as hostile as it could be with the technology available then, and the trillion dollar companies hoarding our data are as hostile as they can be with the technology present now, is Clippy a good mascot for an initiative like this or is it a good mascot for the trillion dollar companies?reply",

      "This is why having a safety net and resources to try again is so powerful. Given enough chances you will make it, big. That means the #1 factor in success is the number of chances you get to fail and try again, not necessarily how inherently good you are. I try to remind myself of this often. I have been given so many chances, and I took them.reply",
      "This always sounded intuitively correct to me, but looking back over the past two decades basically all of the successful entrepreneurs and business owners I know didn\u2019t come from families with a lot of resources and didn\u2019t have much of a safety net. They just went all in on their goals when they were young and had many years ahead of them to start over if it all went wrong.Contrast this with some of the people I grew up who came from wealthy families: A lot of their parents pushed them toward entrepreneurship and funded their ventures, but to date I can only think of one business from this cluster of friends that went anywhere. When you come from such resources and wealth that you don\u2019t need to succeed and you can drop the business as soon as it becomes difficult, it\u2019s a different situation.I don\u2019t know exactly what to make of this, other than to remind myself to keep pushing through the difficult times for things I really want even when I could fall back to an easy path and give up.reply",
      "Good to share, but n=1 I suppose. For me (also n=1) it's the opposite in my circle. The ones without resources never went anywhere and reproduced their parents' class. The ones with resources that went into entrepreneurship (and had the possibility of failing and still being fine) are the most successful.Agreed on your final point though! Tenacity probably is the biggest driver.reply",
      "I've seen quite a few of these funded entrepreneur-lifestyle kids now; I've worked (briefly) with many of their companies. Many of them are making enough of a real go at it such that I can't tell them from others, but quite a few don't know enough about how a default alive business works and deliver a DoA even when the core idea or a short pivot works and has traction - these guys need so much better PMF to succeed.The best businesses I've seen parents find for their children are lettings agents (urgh) and basic manufacturing (last mile door assembly etc.). You can get the business model in a six month course, the staff are minimum wage, the product is high margin. If your parents buy the building you are so close to default alive its a joke. Grow the business, flip it, and try the big idea.reply",
      "Who are you thinking of? Bezos, Zuckerberg, Gates, Musk all came from wealthy families. They all had the safety net of their family wealth if their business didn\u2019t work out. Even someone who had parents to pay their student loans is relatively privileged, not everyone starts their 20\u2019s debt-free and able to take financial risks.reply",
      "There is also survivor bias at play here.Succeeding without safety net is hard -> only the best can do it -> the best entrepreneurs you know did not had a safety netreply",
      "Then let\u2019s control for that. Among people with a decent safety net, can we correlate eventual success with number of tries?The answer seems self evident, but idk for sure, and I would like to know the Gini coefficient of successes vs failures among safety netters be that of non-safety netters. Wouldn\u2019t we expect the successes within the safety net to be massively larger on average than those of the non-safety netters, given that a safety net affords you so many more swings to take? Your comment suggests that this is not the case, driven by the selection/survivor effect within non-safety netreply",
      "I wouldn't assume size of success is correlated with \"having success or not.\" It's notoriously hard to predict what business ideas will succeed at all, let alone be mega-billion-success-stories. Many things could've gone differently leading to Bezos being a ten- or hundred-millionaire vs a multi-billionaire even in worlds where Amazon was successful. AWS, for instance, was not in the original plan.I think the strongest correlations would be between:\"has safety net\" and \"has success\" - one major factor here is not having a poverty mentality that would lead to panicking and quitting earlyas well as between \"has safety net\" and \"takes multiple swings if no initial success\", for the direct reason of \"can afford to do so.\"reply",
      "I mean Gates, Musk, Bezos, etc all had a safety net.Also need to define what successful means because a lot of trades people are successful solo-prenuers but don't make more than say a doctor.reply",
      "In a thread about survivor bias, and you fall for the same trap. How many people coming from wealthy background end up failing?Take Bill Gates, his father cofounded a law firm, and his mother was a board members of several firms. That is a very wealthy background, but not outrageously so. How many people of the same level of wealth became successful businesspeople? It's said that his mom being on the same board as IBM's CEO at the time was a more instrumental factor to his eventual success than his family's wealth, and his own effort of course.reply"

      "Yeah I'm in favor of leverage == taxable event. I think the meaningful difference between leveraged and unleveraged capital gains is that when you take a loan, you access liquidity via your ownership in the asset. If you had gotten a dividend, that would have been taxable. A loan with a stock backing it isn't the same thing, but it does have a somewhat similar effect.reply",
      "You still need to pay off that loan eventually though.These asset backed loans are just regular loans with lower interest rates. So instead of getting $50M @ 11% they can get it at 4%. That's the extent of the \"hack\".They then keep the ball rolling by refinancing at each expiry and just paying the interest (and hoping their assets maintain or increase in value)Eventually those loans will need to be repaid and the money will need to come from realizing capital gains.So if anything its a tax deferral scheme with a low interest rate and elevated liquidation risk. Which all raises the issue of being taxed twice on the same money. Taxes once when you take the loan against it, and taxed again when you realize the profit to pay the loan.reply",
      "The trick is that the USA steps up the buy price of an asset when you pass away. So if you use cheap loans your whole life, you can defer capital tax until it goes away.Instead of two certainties in life being death and taxes, it's now death or taxes.reply",

The large majority of assets held by wealthy people are non-liquid, in the US most studies put it in the 60-70% range.Your paycheck is denominated in cash money.

We show that accrual-based taxation creates two opposing effects: successful founders face greater dilution from advance tax payments, whereas unsuccessful founders receive tax credits that effectively provide insurance. Using comprehensive new data on U.S. venture capital deals, we find that founder returns remain extremely skewed, with 84% receiving zero exit value while the top 2% capture 80% of total value. Moving from current realization-based to accrual-based taxation would reduce founder ownership at exit by 25% on average but would also increase the fraction receiving positive payoffs from 16% to 47% when tax credits are refunded. Embedding these distributions in a dynamic career choice model, we find that founders with no or moderate risk aversion prefer the current realization-based tax system, while more risk-averse founders prefer accrual-based taxation."

About halfway into teaching the class, I was struck by the realization that virtually every problem was solved in the same way, by recognizing the \"form\" of a problem and applying an algorithm appropriate for that form, drawn from the most recent chapter.In the TFA, the natural log in the integrand was a dead give-away because it only comes from one place in the standard order of topics in calculus class.Is this what we call intuition?The students called this the \"trick.\" Many of them had come from high school math under the impression that math was subjective, and was a matter of guessing the teacher's preferred trick from among the many possible.For instance, all of the class problems involving maxima and minima involved a quadratic equation, since it was the only form with an extremum that the students had learned. Every min/max problem culminated with completing the square. I taught my students a formula that they could just memorize.The whole affair left me with a bad taste in my mouth.reply",

The idea is that you will be more productive with say Python than you would with ASM or twiddling electrical switches that correspond to register inputs.A purist might note that using Python is not sufficiently close to the bare metal to be really productive.My recommendation would be to encourage the tutor to ask the student how they use the LLM and to school them in effective use strategies - that will involve problem definition and formulation and then an iterative effort to solve the problem.  It will obviously involve how to spot and deal with hallucinations.  They'll need to start discovering model quality for differing tasks and all sorts of things that look like sci-fi to me 10 years ago.I think we are at, for LLMs, the \"calculator on digital wrist watch\" stage that we had in the mid '80s before the really decent scientific calculators rocked up.

Even if the system wants to ensure that students are taught how to learn and not just a specific curriculum, their stakeholders have to be on board.I think we're shifting to a world where not only will elite status markers like working at places like McKinsey and Google be more valuable but also interview processes will be significantly lengthened because companies will be doing assessments themselves and not trusting credentials from an education system that's suffering from great inflation and automationreply",

It's a lazy kind of curriculum building that doesn't actually tell the students about OOP.In that sense it's no wonder that AI is not that helpful in the context of the assignment and learning.I wouldn't chalk this up to \"AI doesn't help you learn\". I would put this in the category of, in an overly academic assignment with contrived goals, AI doesn't help the student accomplish the goals of the course.

The SEU issues were my first though followed by the thermal concerns, and both are addressed here fantastically.On the SEU issue I\u2019ll add in that even in LEO you can still get SEUs - the ISS is in LEO and gets SEUs on occasion. There\u2019s also the South Atlantic Anomaly where spacecraft in LEO see a higher number of SEUs.reply",

If you ignored the capex cost to get this launched and running in orbit, could the cooling cost be smaller?  Maybe that's the gimmick being used to sell the idea.  \"Yes it costs more upfront but then the 40% cooling bill goes away... breakeven in X years\"reply",
      "Is it an advantage though ? One of the main objections in the article is exactly that.There's no atmosphere that helps with heat loss through convection, there's nowhere to shed heat through conduction, all you have is radiation. It is a serious engineering challenge for spacecrafts to getting rid of the little heat they generate, and avoid being overheated by the sun.reply",
      "Strictly speaking, the thermosphere is actually much warmer than the atmosphere we experience--on the order of 100's or even a 1000 degrees Celsius, if you're measuring by temperature (the average kinetic energy of molecules). However, since particle density is so low, the number of molecules is quite low, and so total heat content of the thermosphere is low. But since particle count is low, conduction and convection are essentially nonexistent, which means cooling needs to rely entirely on radiation, which is much less efficient than other modes at cooling.In other words, a) background temperature (to the extent it's even meaningful) is much warmer than Earth's surface and b) cooling is much, much more difficult than on Earth.reply",

      "But the cooling cost wouldn\u2019t be smaller. There\u2019s no good way to eliminate the waste heat into space. It\u2019s actually far far harder to radiate the waste heat into space directly than it would be to get rid of it on Earth.reply",

      "Are we sure that the base reveals nothing about the factors if n is composite? I have never seen a proof of that.Usually, zero knowledge proofs also require a prover who knows the answer (the factors in this case). This is just a primality test that can be performed locally.reply",
      "That's a very good question. It all depends on how you pick the witness b: there is a procedure that definitely is not zero-knowledge: say, if prover uses his knowledge of factorization to construct an explicit b that betrays that factorization.For example, if n = p1*p2*...*pk is square-free and not a Carmichael number, then by Korselt's criterion there exists a pi such that pi-1 does not divide n-1 (this also implies that pi>2). Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to produce b such that b=1 (mod pj) for all j!=i, and b (mod pi) is a generator of (Z/piZ)^*. Then b is a Fermat witness: gcd(b, n) = 1 (because b is non-zero modulo every prime factor) and b^(n-1) != 1 (mod n) because b^(n-1) != 1 (mod pi) (as pi-1 does not divide n-1).However, b \"betrays\" the prime factorization of n, since gcd(b-1, n)>1 (by construction b-1 is divisible by all pj with j!=i, but not divisible by pi>2), and thus gcd(b-1, n) is a non-trivial factor of n. (I assumed square-free above but if pi^ei (ei>=2) divides n, then b=1+pi^(ei-1) (mod pi^ei), b=1 (mod pj^ej) (j!=i) also would have worked.)On the other hand, it is also known that for non-Carmichael numbers at least half of the bases b with gcd(b, n) = 1 are Fermat witnesses. So if you pick b uniformly at random, the verifier does not gain any new information from seeing b: they could have sampled such a witness themselves by running the same random test. Put another way, the Fermat test itself is an OK ingredient, but a prover who chooses b in a factorization-dependent way can absolutely leak the factors - the final protocol won't be ZK.reply",
      "On a related note, I've often wondered what each congruence in the quadratic seive reveals. Once you have enough of them you can factor the number, but what does a partial set of congruences reveal?Its a matrix problem, so each row could be reducing the degrees of freedom of something. But what? And in what space?reply",

And (a - b) must be a multiple of the other factor of m.>  I've often wondered what each congruence in the quadratic seive reveals.Each congruence reveals that the sum of the bases (a plus b) contains a factor of m. And the difference of the bases (a minus b) contains another factor of m.The only thing you have to watch out for is the trivial case when one of the factors you find through this method is \"1\" and the other factor is \"m\". That case isn't very helpful.It's not that each congruence gives you new information. You only have to find one single non-trivial congruence. But the other (trivial) congruences you find along the way only reveal that 1*m=m, which you already knew.reply",
      "> It's not that each congruence gives you new informationSo it's not that each congruence gives you N bits of information, and you want kN bits in total. It's more like each congruence has a 1/k chance of giving you the full kN bits.But in some information theory sense those are the same! Or concretely, if you were testing a large quantity of numbers in parallel, you would get information from each congruence.reply",

      "My understanding is that there is a difference between the concept of a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), and then the applications that such a thing is possible.In the example given, I can prove that N is composite without revealing anything (well, almost anything) about the factors.

You may doubt this, but there is a process by which I can ... to any desired level of confidence ... demonstrate that I have a colouring, without revealing what the colouring is.

      "> most normal people don't know what Claude or Gemini areIn think the point is that they don\u2019t need to know what Gemini is, they just need to know Google, which they most definitely do.IMO ads rollout won\u2019t be as simple as you\u2019re describing it. A lot of people have switched from Google search to AI specifically because it isn\u2019t filled with SEO, ad filled nonsense. So they\u2019ll need to tread very, very carefully to introduce it without alienating customers. Not to mention mollifying advertisers who are nervous what their product will be shown alongside and OpenAI will probably struggle to offer iron clad guarantees about it. And people generally speaking don\u2019t like ads. If competitors like Google are able to hold out longer with no ads (they certainly aren\u2019t wanting for ad display surfaces) they might be able to pull users away from OpenAI.IMO pivoting to ads is a sign of core weakness for OpenAI. Anyone trying to set up their own ad network in 2025 has to reckon with Google and Meta, the two absolute behemoths of online ads. And both also happen to be major competitors of OpenAI. If they need ads that\u2019s a problem.reply",

While waiting for your Turkey to finish cooking, why not have an ice cold Coke Zero?  Click here for nearby locations.4. Remove Turkey from the oven, let rest for ten minutes while listening to Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars sing \"Die with a Smile\" on Spotify.reply",
      "This is where Tesla has a key advantage. Optimus can walk you to the kitchen to look for a Coke Zero. Google and OpenAI cannot compete with this.reply",
      "this is one of those HN style comments where business acumen and pertinent sarcasm are wholly indistinguishable .reply",
      "Poe's Law notwithstanding, I find it hard to believe that anyone would think I was making a good faith business acumen observation. If Optimus walks you to the kitchen to get a coke, what's Tesla's business model? Charge by the nanosecond for compute time?reply",
      "Purchase/lease access to the hardware, subscription for the necessary online connectivity, and microtransactions for each actual use of it (ostensibly because of cloud compute, and that also means surveillance data is captured and monetized).reply",

      "The robot suggested a coke zero because it was paid to by the Coca-Cola Company. Now you'll need to buy more coke zero to replace what you drank.reply",
      "The business model for Tesla and xAI is actually very simple and superior to OpenAI and Google's. No, this is not satire:The business model is that his companies are meme stocks, and controlling social media means controlling meme stocks. The business model is also that his companies require corporate socialism, and controlling social media means influencing government policy.He can talk about AI driving cars, but that's yesterday's news. Today, his business model for AI is to put his finger on the scale and influence society to help him become richer. AI is threatening to replace search, but in a way it's also threatening part of what social media provides, namely the ability to guide discourse at scale.What's easier: Getting his personal board to give him a trillion dollars, and shoring up public support for that with bias in his AI products and on X? Or building a trillion-dollar business?Elon Musk's business model for AI is actually quite easy to understand.reply"
