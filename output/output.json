      "> The ELF file contains a dynamic section which tells the kernel which shared libraries to load, and another section which tells the kernel to dynamically \u201crelocate\u201d pointers to those functions, so everything checks out.This is not how dynamic linking works on GNU/Linux. The kernel processes the program headers for the main program (mapping the PT_LOAD segments, without relocating them) and notices the PT_INTERP program interpreter (the path to the dynamic linker) among the program headers. The kernel then loads the dynamic linker in much the same way as the main program (again without relocation) and transfers control to its entry point. It's up to the dynamic linker to self-relocate, load the referenced share objects (this time using plain mmap and mprotect, the kernel ELF loader is not used for that), relocate them and the main program, and then transfer control to the main program.The scheme is not that dissimilar to the #! shebang lines, with the dynamic linker taking the role of the script interpreter, except that ELF is a binary format.reply",

Here\u2019s a summary of that rabbit hole.First question: When is the OS kernel actually asked to run any program? The answer, at least on Linux, is the execve system call (\u201csyscall\u201d). Let\u2019s take a quick look at that:This is actually quite straightforward! We pass the name of the exectuable file, a list of arguments, and a list of environment variables. This signals to the kernel where, and how, to start loading the program.Many programming languages provide an interface to execute commands that eventually call execve under the hood. For example, in Rust, we have:In these higher-level wrappers, the language\u2019s standard library often handles translation of the command name to a full path,"

      "That really isn't unreasonable at all IMO, it's just that it might be hard to do with userspace syscall emulation, since graphical programs will likely need a lot more of the syscall surface. For X11 and Wayland, you'll need some way of handling UNIX domain sockets. Wayland applications will require shared memory too, though you could get away with something like Waypipe instead to serialize everything. You'd probably want some sort of intermediary between any X11/Wayland communications anyways, just to add additional isolation.It might be easier to adapt gVisor to handle this sort of workload. Adjacent comment mentions Qubes which does the same thing but uses an entire guest kernel.(If you are creative enough, you can probably come up with some solutions. Qt apps could be made to work with a custom QPA that can somehow funnel information in and out of the sandbox. You could definitely run something like Waypipe or Xpra in the sandbox too, but again I imagine those would wind up requiring a much greater degree of emulation. It's not like I've actually tried this, though, so I could be off.)reply",
      "TinyKVM is probably most similar to gVisor in KVM platform mode. TinyKVM implements a smaller number of sys calls and is focussed on making resets as fast as possible.Running sys calls on the host means there is approximately 1\u00b5s overhead per syscall from exiting and entering KVM so I'm not sure how well that would work for GUI applications.And we currently only have very rudimentary support for threads, enough for a server program with ancillary threads to boot up but the expectation is currently that the call into TinyKVM only runs a single thread and we fork multiple copies of the VM to handle requests in parallel.reply",
      "> Running sys calls on the host means there is approximately 1\u00b5s overhead per syscall from exiting and entering KVM so I'm not sure how well that would work for GUI applications.That made me rather curious how many syscalls a complex GUI application might issue. I wanted to see how many syscalls were happening across my entire system. Thanks to StackOverflow I have a snippet that seems correct[1]:> perf stat -e raw_syscalls:sys_enter -a -I 1000 sleep 5Using this, it seems that most programs (as you would probably guess) don't execute a whole lot of syscalls when they're idle. However, starting a complex GUI program definitely causes a pretty massive flurry of syscalls. Starting winecfg without an already-existing wineserver spews a lot of syscalls, somewhere in the neighborhood of 500,000. If we assume that each syscall takes on average around 2\u00b5s including the overhead and that they're all serial, I guess that would add up to about 1 second spent on syscalls. That's probably making way too many assumptions, but it does make me feel like it's not completely infeasible to run GUI applications inside of a sandbox like this, though it may very not be compelling when the overhead is factored in.And of course, just because it could be done does not mean it should, anyway. Even if this is a good idea, I doubt it makes any sense for TinyKVM to be attempting to do it. What TinyKVM does do is already very interesting and probably a lot more practical anyways. It'd probably be better to fork off or build an entire purpose-built sandbox for GUI software, realistically.Still, pretty interesting stuff to think about.> And we currently only have very rudimentary support for threads, enough for a server program with ancillary threads to boot up but the expectation is currently that the call into TinyKVM only runs a single thread and we fork multiple copies of the VM to handle requests in parallel.BTW, I think this design is really cool.

But that worked on the overall charm of this period - I dare to say that show felt realistic in that cheapness.The regained interest surely allowed to assign more money to the series.

But none of that mattered, because the team were clearly passionate and enjoyed what they were doing and did a good job so the end product is charming. Production standards have obviously moved on massively since the 1980's and we are better off. The modern episodes are much more highly polished and coherent but not necessarily more popular. Like someone else pointed out the massive influx of disney money did nothing and only exacerbated the train wreck which was the recent doctor who seasons.Another film that had a huge impact was monty python and the holy grail which was produced with a budget of 75p and ends abruptly because the money ran out.

We were kinda cluttered people growing up, so among other things (an extensive sci-fi collection, hundreds of kitchen gadgets, every microcomputer under the sun) we always had little piles and containers of beautiful shiny rocks strewn around the place. I never had the patience for the tumbling process, but on every beach I considered it my responsibility to find the most intriguing shapes and colours of rocks, fill my pockets, and bring them home. She died this year. We were supposed to scatter her ashes on that beach but my dad refused for inscrutable reasons.

One thing I have found interesting is that you can make your own \"sea glass\", by breaking wine or beer bottles, and tumbling the big-ish chunks. The thicker the glass, the better, of course.

Takes 2-3 weeks vs 2-3 months, looks amazing, and my kids can actually see results before they lose interest.

      "Really grateful that a project like this took on the task to ask for legal advice, and extra kudos for actually releasing a statement based on their understanding of the legal advice. Hopefully will be useful to lots of similar organizations.Libera.chat seems to say that even if Ofcom thinks they have a case, they don't as Libera's user base doesn't have enough UK users:> The exact fraction of the UK\u2019s online population that must use a given service to be considered \u201csignificant\u201d is unknown, but based on our counsel\u2019s observations of Ofcom\u2019s previous regulatory actions, it appears to be much higher than our internal estimates of how large our UK user base is.Related submission with 788 comments from ~1 week ago: \"4Chan Lawyer publishes Ofcom correspondence\" - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45614148reply",

      "Good insights.1. Do you think that getting the legal advice was a good defensive measure?(Something to point to, to establish that they were being responsible, if ever challenged.)2. And do you think that publicizing it was a good idea?(Probably they are drawing fire on Monday morning, like you said.  But maybe it's a plausibly good tactical move because, just speculating here, someone now takes the time to pay attention to who they are, rather than them later land on some poorly-informed list of non-compliants that gets rubber-stamped for action.)reply",
      "> significant can mean anything ofcom want it toYou're right in the sense that they can pursue whomever they want based on whatever interpretation of \"significant\" they may hold.

      "They weren't in a strong legal position then: a few mistakes over the course of decades substantially weakened their ability to fight back against Andrew Lee (without significant personal expense). Libera's legal structure is much stronger, and (importantly) the Ofcom has nothing to gain from going after them. (Libera aren't, after all, part of the problem.)reply",
      "I think you are putting too much faith in the courts. They are independent, but they have shown time and again that they will interpret the law how they like. They don't live in a vacuum and they certainly aren't free from, or blind to political considerations that influence their decisions, like the rest of us. Ofcom are very clearly the sort of people who want to apply the most open ended and widespread use of the powers they can in a misguided effort to save the public from themselves and i have very little confidence that our judges are not cut from the same cloth. I won't go so far as to say they would collude with ofcom, but i do think they are more likely to side with them over the defendants, however weak the case may be.The problem is the law is worded in the vaguest way possible and ofcom in exceptionally bad faith have refused to give any clear guidance on what they will and won't prosecute. Our politicians in their arrogance have passed this law, so expect no help from them.reply",
      "Not sure why your comment has been received negatively when it seems to be obviously true. Yes, \"significant\" is ambiguous and I wouldn't be surprised if the intention is to give themselves discretion to go after whoever they choose. The OSA is insidious.reply",

      "In these games involving companies with no physical presence in the UK, OfCom has only two realistic enforcement strategies:1. Arrest the founders or officers at the UK border if they attempt to enter.2.

      "From the intro to the original paper:But deep conceptual shifts within twentieth-century science have undermined this Cartesian-Newtonian metaphysics; revisionist studies in the history and philosophy of science have cast further doubt on its credibility; and, most recently, feminist and poststructuralist critiques have demystified the substantive content of mainstream Western scientific practice, revealing the ideology of domination concealed behind the fa\u00e7ade of ``objectivity''. It has thus become increasingly apparent that physical ``reality'', no less than social ``reality'', is at bottom a social and linguistic construct; that scientific ``knowledge\", far from being objective, reflects and encodes the dominant ideologies and power relations of the culture that produced it; that the truth claims of science are inherently theory-laden and self-referential; and consequently, that the discourse of the scientific community, for all its undeniable value, cannot assert a privileged epistemological status with respect to counter-hegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or marginalized communities. These themes can be traced, despite some differences of emphasis, in Aronowitz's analysis of the cultural fabric that produced quantum mechanics; in Ross' discussion of oppositional discourses in post-quantum science; in Irigaray's and Hayles' exegeses of gender encoding in fluid mechanics; and in Harding's comprehensive critique of the gender ideology underlying the natural sciences in general and physics in particular.https://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgre...And the reveal, including a brief discussion of the \u201cethical issues involved in my rather unorthodox experiment\u201d: https://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingu...reply",

To think that the author and journal co-editor at the time would wind up working together as early advocates for Palenstinian rights is an incredible plot twist.reply",
      "Is it that much of a plot twist?  It\u2019s possible for more than one thing to be true at once \u2013 that postmodernist nonsense deserves to be mocked and belittled, and that Palestinians deserve rights.reply",
      "Not OP, but I think the plot twist is, maybe we need to be able to entertain \"obviously absurd\" ideas to be able to land on a correct position if the culture we're inside of is not ready for those ideas yet.  (No idea if the journal was really that early on this particular position though)Crucially, entertaining ideas isn't the same as believing them, it's about giving them some time and space so you can work out whether it's consistent, rich, useful.  Even in math this stuff is hard to get right, just look at the resistance and ridicule that Cantor had to go through, or look at the development of non-Euclidean geometry.  And that's a space where proof is actually possible.  Critical theory is a real thing but is always walking this fine line between being nonsense or being revolutionary.reply",
      "By its very nature, postmodernism can't be correct or incorrect. The most it can do is provide a perspective or method of analysis. Some people might find it interesting or even useful. (Personally I see it as trite intellectual masturbation, but that's just me.)reply",
      "I think it's great that they were early advocates for Palestinian rights (I'm a liberal capitalist and dislike Marxism but have always been very sympathetic to the Palestinians and their cause), but, as this article states, this is a Marxist magazine. For a very long time, Marxists have been on this side. Don't see why it would be a twist.reply",
      "There's some interesting stuff in here if you can tolerate the meandering and the way-back-when.  Like you'd expect from po-mo wonks, everything's gotta be infinitely subtle and infinitely contextualized. So no big mea-culpa and no big defensive denial either.  All of that's been hashed and rehashed many times already I guess.  You'll find some self-deprecating humor, some spots with surprising self-awareness, some with a surprising lack of it.  The main fresh thing is how they'd like to try and compare/contrast/contextualize it in this moment.  For example:> Being a gatekeeper by maintaining high intellectual standards is not what public opinion would associate with Social Text, to say the least. Yet that is what the journal practiced, mainly. And it is a practice worth defending, however elitist it might look. All the more so because of how the Trump administration has weaponized both the idea of the hoax and the program of anti-elitism. [..] We know what has befallen intellectual standards.  [..] Is this ChatGPT, or is it Orwell\u2019s doublethink?Well ok, there's a conversation to be had about these things!  This is not the time to pontificate though, it's the time for sweet revenge.  There's never been a better time for po-mo wonks to lean on AI slop and blast physics journals with fake stuff about gravity until someone understaffed falls for the trick.
