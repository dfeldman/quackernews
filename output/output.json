      "If you want to do code-CAD for anything substantial and you haven't yet developed a significant dependency on OpenSCAD, do your brain a favour and spend at least some time with CadQuery, Build123D or (if you prefer JS to Python) Replicad.As impressive as NopSCADlib and BOSL2 are (and OMG they are, when you consider what they have to work with!), OpenSCAD is a one-way, declarative CSG environment that essentially only outputs mesh formats. It's really not that much better than working with three-dimensional pixels. You won't really be able to analyse, iterate over or measure your models, easily build on faces, do easy chamfers or fillets, export STEP files, make use of constraint-based designs, model assemblies, or so many other things that \"CAD\" means in the 21st century. All the tools that help you do this on OpenSCAD are layers and layers of task-specific hacks and clever bodges.I totally get wanting to make models with version-controlled text files instead of GUI CAD (which can be a sort of weird battle to learn for a programmer), and I get wanting to avoid FreeCAD. I just don't really get wanting to limit oneself to such a limited concept of a 3D \"model\"!The three alternative systems I mention are all based around bindings to (or in Replicad's case, cross-compilation of) OpenCASCADE, which is a bRep CAD kernel capable of much richer interactions. It is not without its faults, but arguably code-CAD spares you from some of the inscrutability that trips up FreeCAD's interactive model.\n \nreply",
      "I poked around with CadQuery and Build123D.The learning curve required a paradigm shifted in abstraction. That was too much.I just want OpenSCAD simplicity, but with modern programming language syntax.I ended up settling with PythonScad. I was able to hit the ground running and leverage what I already know about python within a day.It's new, but the author is extremely active and collaborative on github (https://github.com/gsohler/openscad) and reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/pythonscad/). The author actually pushed for merging this into OpenSCAD mainline, but got gatekeeped out since OpenSCAD maintainers believed Python went against OpenSCAD's mantra of being 'secure'.I recommend PythonSCAD to anyone that liked OpenSCAD simplicity in abstraction but feel handicapped by the lack of expressiveness.\n \nreply",
      "> The learning curve required a paradigm shifted in abstraction.This is true! And I think that brute-force simplicity of OpenSCAD is the appeal. I am still ultimately a CAD greenhorn but it got me started, and I don't blame you.But I guess the point I am getting to is, that paradigm shift is where you really want to be. It's certainly where I think most competent programmers who want to really build in 3D should want to be.Because it unlocks the ability to reason about the shapes you're creating, within the code that creates them. You can for example place a feature in the centre of a face of an object you just created, without having to recalculate the location of the centre of the face or the normal etc.You can write code that is truly parametric with real encapsulations, and without a battery of variable definitions and calculations for every single element -- because you can reflect on what you've already made.(You can also export STEP files to other packages, import STEP files and reason about/analyse those as objects rather than meshes.)\n \nreply",
      "Thankfully I have been able to do what I want to do without learning the complexity that comes with Build123d etc.Perhaps someday, but I havent had the need to get there thus far.Also: Encapsulation etc was achievable with Python, which is something I already know. PythonSCAD checked all the boxes for me without the learning curve.\n \nreply",
      "Coming from freecad as my only frame of reference, even though I understand the concepts of build123d, I found it wildly difficult to express anything useful in it.Not saying it's not possible - I've seen what it can do - but even with my software background it was hard for me to really work with something that isn't based on constraints.\n \nreply",
      "I ultimately went the other way, and got to FreeCAD from OpenSCAD via CadQuery; it was CadQuery that helped me understand important concepts.CadQuery may appeal to you? It does have (some) early support for constraints in 2D and 3D I believe.(CadQuery and Build123D ultimately share both OCP underpinnings and viewer tooling.)\n \nreply",
      "> OpenSCAD is a one-way, declarative CSG environment that essentially only outputs mesh formatsThis is why such a basic-seeming thing as \u201chow do i get the binding box for this CSG frankenobject I\u2019ve created?\u201d comes up again and again on stackoverflow etc.  it\u2019s apparently not possible without some hacks.I\u2019ll take a look at the alternatives you mentioned, thanks.\n \nreply",
      "That is... a weird post to be making from a throwaway account.  Do you work for Big OpenSCAD or something? :)But that said, this is all correct.  OpenSCAD is actually an extremely limited environment and much more expressive tools exist in the same \"code-based 3D modelling\" space.\n \nreply",
      "This is a totally reasonable question! I am using a throwaway to limit my HN usage, to be honest. I wish I had a better way to manage my addictive social media behaviour than torching accounts after a few discussions. But I do not.I saw this thread only because it's clearly a followup to the FreeCAD discussion the other day that I have contributed to.--People do get oddly grumpy when you criticise OpenSCAD; there is an element of the \"I can do maths and refuse to believe CAD needs to be any more than this\" militancy about it.I absolutely don't hate it -- OpenSCAD's mere existence is what unlocked my ability to even reason in 3D, actually. But that quasi-militant tendency is holding back a fascinating, liberating software field.\n \nreply",
      "The great thing about OpenSCAD is that it makes creating models which may be described mathematically/programmatically easy.The awful thing about OpenSCAD is that what one can create in it is strongly bounded by one's facility with and fluency in mathematics.I'm curious how the new Python-enabled (I really hope it gets added in to the program itself) will affect this.\n \nreply"

      "Once GPT is tuned more heavily on Lean (proof assistant) -- the way it is on Python -- I expect its usefulness for research level math to increase.I work in a field related to operations research (OR), and ChatGPT 4o has ingested enough of the OR literature that it's able to spit out very useful Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations for many \"problem shapes\". For instance, I can give it a logic problem like \"i need to put i items in n buckets based on a score, but I want to fill each bucket sequentially\" and it actually spits out a very usable math formulation.  I usually just need to tweak it a bit. It also warns against weak formulations where the logic might fail, which is tremendously useful for avoiding pitfalls. Compare this to the old way, which is to rack my brain over a weekend to figure out a water-tight formulation of MIP optimization problem (which is often not straightforward for non-intuitive problems). GPT has saved me so much time in this corner of my world.Yes, you probably wouldn't be able to use ChatGPT well for this purpose unless you understood MIP optimization in the first place -- and you do need to break down the problem into smaller chunks so GPT can reason in steps --  but for someone who can and does, the $20/month I pay for ChatGPT more than pays for itself.side: a lot of people who complain on HN that (paid/good - only Sonnet 3.5 and GPT4o are in this category) LLMs are useless to them probably (1) do not know how to use LLMs in way that maximizes their strengths; (2) have expectations that are too high based on the hype, expecting one-shot magic bullets. (3) LLMs are really not good for their domain. But many of the low-effort comments seem to mostly fall into (1) and (2) -- cynicism rather than cautious optimism.Many of us who have discovered how to exploit LLMs in their areas of strength -- and know how to check for their mistakes --  often find them providing significant leverage in our work.\n \nreply",
      "I entirely agree about their utility.HN, and the internet in general, have become just an ocean of reactionary sandbagging and blather about how \"useless\" LLMs are.Meanwhile, in the real world, I've found that I haven't written a line of code in weeks. Just paragraphs of text that specify what I want and then guidance through and around pitfalls in a simple iterative loop of useful working code.It's entirely a learned skill, the models (and very importantly the tooling around them) have arrived at the base line they needed.Much Much more productive world by just knuckling down and learning how to do the work.edit: https://aider.chat/ + paid 3.5 sonnet\n \nreply",
      "> Much Much more productive world by just knuckling down and learning how to do the work.The fact everyone that say they've become more productive with LLMs won't say how exactly. I can talk about how VIM have make it more enjoyable to edit code (keybinding and motions), how Emacs is a good environment around text tooling (lisp machine), how I use technical books to further my learning (so many great books out here). But no one really show how they're actually solving problems with LLMs and how the alternatives were worse for them. It's all claims that it's great with no further elaboration on the workflows.> I haven't written a line of code in weeks. Just paragraphs of text that specify what I want and then guidance through and around pitfalls in a simple iterative loop of useful working code.Code is intent described in terms of machinery actions. Those actions can be masked by abstracting them in more understandable units, so we don't have to write opcodes, but we can use python instead. Programming is basically make the intent clear enough so that we know what units we can use. Software engineering is mostly selecting the units in a way to do minimal work once the intent changes or the foundational actions do.Chatting with a LLM look to me like your intent is either vague or you don't know the units to use. If it's the former, then I guess you're assuming it is the expert and will guide you to the solution you seek, which means you believe it understands the problem more than you do. The second is more strange as it looks like playing around with car parts, while ignoring the manuals it comes with.What about boilerplate and common scenarios? I agree that LLMs helps a great deal with that, but the fact is that there are perfectly good tools that helped with that like snippets, templates, and code generators.\n \nreply",
      "Ever seen someone try and search something on Google and they are just AWFUL at it? They can never find what they're looking for and then you try and can pull it up in a single search? That's what it is like watching some people try to use LLM's. Learning how to prompt an LLM is as much a learned skill as much as learning how to phrase internet searches is a learned skill. And as much as people decried that \"searching Google isn't a real skill\" tech-savvy people knew better.Same thing except now it's also many tech-savvy people joining in with the tech-unsavvy in saying that prompting isn't a real skill...but people who know better know that it is.On average, people are awfully bad at describing exactly what it is they want. Ever speak with a client? And you have to go back and forward for a few hours to finally figure out what it is they wanted? In that scenario you're the LLM. Except the LLM won't keep asking probing questions and clarifications - it will simply give them what they originally asked for (which isn't what they want). Then they think the LLM is stupid and stop trying to ask it for things.Utilizing an LLM to its full potential is a lot of iterative work and, at least for the time being, requires having some understanding of how it works underneath the hood (eg. would you get better results by starting a new session or asking it to forget previous, poorly worded instructions?).\n \nreply",
      "I'm not arguing that you can't get result with LLMs, I'm just asking is it worth the actual effort especially when there's better way to get that result you're seeking (or if the result is really something that you want).An LLM is a word (token?) generator which can be amazingly consistent according to its model. But rarely is my end goal to generate text. It's either to do something, to understand something, or to communicate. For the first, there are guides (books, manuals, ...), for the second, there are explanations (again books, manuals,...), and the third is just using language to communicate what's on my mind.That's the same thing with search engines. I use them to look for something. What I need first is a description of that something, not how to do the \"looking for\". Then once you know what you want to find, it's easier to use the tool to find it.If your end goal can be achieved with LLMs, be my guest to use them. But, I'm wary of people taking them at face value and then pushing the workload unto everyone else (like developers using electron).\n \nreply",
      "It's hard to quantify how much time learning how to search saves because the difference can range between infinite (finding the result vs not finding it at all) to basically no difference (1st result vs 2nd result). I think many people agree it is worth learning how to \"properly search\" though. You spend much less time searching and you get the results you're looking for much more often. This applies outside of just Google search: learning how to find and lookup information is a useful skill in and of itself.ChatGPT has helped me write some scripts for things that otherwise probably would have taken me at least 30+ minutes and it wrote them in <10 seconds and they worked flawlessly. I've also had times where I worked with it to develop something that ended up taking me 45 minutes to only ever get error-ridden code that I had to fix the obvious errors and rewrite parts of it to get it working. Sometimes during this process it actually has taught me a new approach to doing something. If I had started from scratch coding it by myself it probably would have taken me only 10~ minutes. But if I was better at prompting what if that 45 minutes was <10 minutes? It would go from from a time loss to a time save and be worth using. So improving my ability to prompt is worthwhile as long as doing so trends towards me spending less time prompting.Which is thankfully pretty easy to track and test. On average, as I get better at prompting, do I need to spend more or less time prompting to get the results I am looking for? The answer to that is largely that I spend less time and get better results. The models constantly changing and improving over time can make this messy - is it the model getting better or is it my prompting? But I don't think models change significantly enough to rule out that I spend less time prompting than I have in the past.\n \nreply",
      "> asking is it worth the actual effortIf prompting ability varies then this is not some objective question, it depends on each person.For me I've found more or less every interaction with an LLM to be useful. The only reason I'm not using it continually for 8 hours a day is because my brain is not able to usefully manage that torrent of new information and I need downtime.\n \nreply",
      "It works quite nicely if you consider LLMs as a translator (and that\u2019s actually why Transformers were created).Enter technical specifications in English as input language, get code as destination language.\n \nreply",
      "English as input language works in simple scenarios but breaks down very very quickly. I have to get extremely specific and deliberate. At some point I have to write pseudocode to get the machine to get say double checked locking right. Because I have enough experiences where varying the prompting didn't work, I revert to just writing the code when I see the generator struggling.When I encounter somebody who says they do not write code anymore, I assume that they either:1. Just don't do anything beyond the simplest tutorial-level stuff2. or don't consider their post-generation edits as writing code3. or are just bullshittingI don't know which it is for each person in question, but I don't trust that their story would work for me. I don't believe they have some secret sauce prompting that works for scenarios where I've tried to make it work but couldn't. Sure I may have missed some ways, but my map of what works and what doesn't may be very blurry at the border, but the surprises tend to be on the \"doesn't work\" side. And no Claude doesn't change this.\n \nreply",

      "An annoyance with spreadsheets that deterred me from ever using them in teaching is that they've perpetuated a arithmetic order-of-precedence bug. (\"Bug\" in the sense that it contradicts long-standing mathematical convention.) If you type    -3^2\n\nin a cell and press ENTER, the spreadsheet tell you it's \"9\". It should be \"-9\"; in math, exponentiation has precedence over unary minus, so you square 3, then negate the result. For instance, if you tell students to graph \"y = -x^2\", they should draw a parabola opening downward.I don't have a recent copy of Excel to check this in, but this was the case in the '97 version. I just tried it in the current LibreOffice calc, and it returns \"9\". My guess is that one of the early spreadsheets messed up the order of precedence, and everybody after copied it for compatibility.On the other hand, I just tried maxima and python and they both give \"-9\".I wonder if this particular problem afflicts people who copy formulas from (say) math books into spreadsheets.\n \nreply",
      "This issue seems like partly an artifact of the invented binary operator ^. In math exponents are superscripts and there's no binary operator- it's part of the term. But for text on computers, binary operators ended up being fabricated for the things you couldn't represent directly. The caret is common and was the first one to appear, but doubled multiplication signs is another one. Traditionally, binary operators have lower precedence than unary operators since the unary minus is considered part of the term, so the exponent turning into an operator mucks things up if it's still implemented to adhere to that logic.You sort of see the same issue with division. The forward slash is a completely invented binary operator since the actual division symbol was often not present- and let's be real nobody uses the binary division operator when writing formulae. It's supposed to represent the dividing line in a fraction, similar to how division is usually represented in a formula as a fraction of two other expressions. It's got lower precedence than anything in either term- but, if you just replace the dividing line with a forward slash to input the formula into a computer, you'll get incorrect results, because it's replacing what is part of a complete term (the division line) with a new binary operator inserted between sets of terms, which is now subject to precedence rules.\n \nreply",
      "I had a discussion on one of the Nim boards because Nim does the same, i.e. Writing -2^2=4 but 0-2^2=-4 because Nim treats the first as the unary - which takes precedence over exponentiation. I realise that you can argue how it is technically correct (and interestingly several of the  people I was talking with couldn't even get my point), but I still argue it's incredibly unintuitive for anyone coming from an regular engineering/science background who wants to do regular work. I would almost argue will exclude it to be used by many due to this.\n \nreply",
      "You're right that violating established mathematical convention can be a deal-killer for some kinds of adoption.A few years ago I was reading the docs for a new programming language, thinking it might be useful in teaching. The docs were well-written and in a beautifully produced book. I got to the chapter on trig functions and discovered that they'd decided to make angles increase clockwise. And there was a graph of the sine function, with the graph below the x-axis from 0 to 180 degrees. And I sadly put the well-written beautifully-produced book on the shelf and haven't looked at it since.I can see why people would think \"angles increase clockwise\" is more natural than the existing convention (\"angles increase counterclockwise\") - it's the way clocks do it, right? Yeah, it's just convention, but when the established convention has been around for at least a century or two and there are libraries full of books and papers which use it, \"more natural\" still isn't good enough reason to break with it. And it really wasn't necessary to do that for their project.I'm sure people who do software can think of lots of conventions which may even suck but will never be replaced.\n \nreply",

      "No - in a subtle way, you're assuming that the unary minus has precedence, when the point is that it doesn't.You're right that \"thing^2\" means \"thing times thing\", but in \"-3^2\", what is it that is being squared?

This does not apply to the binary minus operation '\u2212'; for example in Microsoft Excel while the formulas =-2^2, =-(2)^2 and =0+-2^2 return 4, the formulas =0-2^2 and =-(2^2) return \u22124.\n\n(edit)Digging into this a little bit more...https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/html_mono/bc.html#TOC...

      "I completed the second edition years ago and found it illuminating. It's very well done! The explanations pertaining to OS dev are nice but it was also a useful artifact for learning more Rust after having gone through the Rust book. The author had a good grasp of the idiom of the language, so seeing how he expressed certain things in code vis a vis how I would have done was educational. The blog's explanation of how futures are implemented in Rust was especially a highlight[0], and I think it's the best I've seen on that topic anywhere.I hope Phil will find the inspiration to come back and work on the EFI-based third edition again. AFAICT, (based on commits to the git branches) that has stalled. I was a GitHub sponsor for about a year until my CC expired and was always bummed to see it left out of the \"This Month In Rust OSDev\" posts.Anyway, the second edition is still a great way to spend a weekend's dev time and I appreciate all the hard work that clearly went into it.

      "That sounds like the thing where you turn your bass speaker towards the wall (ideally a corner) and the bass gets louder/better. A friend showed me this in high school; never figured out how this could possibly work.\n \nreply",
      "With low frequencies, directionality is negligible, so it's not about turning it \"toward\" the wall, but about placing it against the wall. I suppose it's possible that the sound radiates more from one side than the other (possibly the side with the cone, or maybe the side with the port if one exists!) so turning it can result in effectively moving it closer. Or maybe you were listening to a more directional frequency range than I'm thinking of. Anyway, why does closer matter?If you suspend a subwoofer up in the air so it has no boundaries, its sound radiates in all directions (full space). If you put it on the floor (let's assume all such boundaries are infinitely dense and thick, for simplicity) its sound now radiates only upwards/outwards (half space). Now push it up against a wall: quarter space. And finally, put it in the corner of the room: eighth space. Of course for a few millimeters it goes toward the boundary but then is reflected back, and so long as the distance isn't so significant relative to the wavelength that destructive interference (cancellation) occurs within the audible range, all interference is constructive (additive). The SPL in the listening area increases by 3 dB for each of these boundaries/halvings, although in practice it's slightly less since typical boundary material is a little bit acoustically absorptive (sound converts to heat) and acoustically transparent (sound is transmitted through to the other side), but even complete absorption isn't any worse than complete transmission to a place with no listener (i.e. the absence of a boundary): the sound goes unused either way.Fun fact: typically half-space is used when citing the efficiency of a speaker in terms of dBSPL/Watt, since the vast majority of the power is for bass, and it's considered rare to emit bass against fewer than one boundary (the floor).The next time you are deciding where to position your bluetooth speaker, if it's lacking in bass, boundary-load it.But this is all about turning non-directional sound into directional sound (through boundary loading, which is a very close cousin to horn loading, as a sibling comment mentions with folded horn cabinet designs). TFA isn't about that though, it's about sound that's already directional! So I doubt any of what I've said is relevant to this mysterious effect.\n \nreply",
      "> The next time you are deciding where to position your bluetooth speaker, if it's lacking in bass, boundary-load it.There's only so much bass that a silly bluetooth speaker can provide. Even the silly Bose speaker where the sound travels through a maze before exiting the unit just can't make bass. Small speakers just can't move enough air nor have enough surface area to generate the waves for bass. Anything less than 12\" is a joke. 15\" is ideal for me as 18\" tends to not be able to cycle fast enough for the music I listen. They do fine for longer sustained lows like in hiphop/rap.

      "> By establishing the mathematical certainty of hallucinations, we challenge the prevailing notion that they can be fully mitigatedHaving a mathematical proof is nice, but honestly this whole misunderstanding could have been avoided if we'd just picked a different name for the concept of \"producing false information in the course of generating probabilistic text\".\"Hallucination\" makes it sound like something is going awry in the normal functioning of the model, which subtly suggests that if we could just identify what went awry we could get rid of the problem and restore normal cognitive function to the LLM. The trouble is that the normal functioning of the model is simply to produce plausible-sounding text.A \"hallucination\" is not a malfunction of the model, it's a value judgement we assign to the resulting text. All it says is that the text produced is not fit for purpose. Seen through that lens it's obvious that mitigating hallucinations and creating \"alignment\" are actually identical problems, and we won't solve one without the other.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, exactly, it\u2019s a post-facto value judgment, not a precise term. If I understand the meaning of the word, \u201challucination\u201d is all the model does. If it happens to hallucinate something we think is objectively true, we just decide not to call that a \u201challucination\u201d. But there\u2019s literally no functional difference between that case and the case of the model saying something that\u2019s objectively false, or something whose objective truth is unknown or undefinable.I haven\u2019t read the paper yet, but if they resolve this definition usefully, that would be a good contribution.\n \nreply",
      "Exactly this, I've been saying this since the beginning. Every response is a hallucination - a probabilistic string of words divorced from any concept of truth or reality.By total coincidence, some hallucinations happen to reflect the truth, but only because the training data happened to generally be truthful sentences.  Therefore, creating something that imitates a truthful sentence will often happen to also be truthful, but there is absolutely no guarantee or any function that even attempts to enforce that.All responses are hallucinations. Some hallucinations happen to overlap the truth.\n \nreply",
      "I think you're going too far here.> By total coincidence, some hallucinations happen to reflect the truth, but only because the training data happened to generally be truthful sentences.It's not a \"total coincidence\". It's the default. Thus, the model's responses aren't \"divorced from any concept of truth or reality\" - the whole distribution from which those responses are pulled is strongly aligned with reality.(Which is why people started using the term \"hallucinations\" to describe the failure mode, instead of \"fishing a coherent and true sentence out of line noise\" to describe the success mode - because success mode dominates.)Humans didn't invent language for no reason. They don't communicate to entertain themselves with meaningless noises. Most of communication - whether spoken or written - is deeply connected to reality. Language itself is deeply connected to reality. Even the most blatant lies, even all of fiction writing, they're all incorrect or fabricated only at the surface level - the whole thing, accounting for the utterance, what it is about, the meanings, the words, the grammar - is strongly correlated with truth and reality.So there's absolutely no coincidence that LLMs get things right more often than not. Truth is thoroughly baked into the training data, simply because it's a data set of real human communication, instead of randomly generated sentences.\n \nreply",

Steve Jobs seemed ancient to me when he returned to Apple in 1997: he was 42.This is not to say that techs, hackers, etc, have grown old -- but the distribution of ages has definitely widened, and its center may have shifted a little right too. That leaves plenty of room for much younger people to look at much older people and wonder at their strange, blowhard opinions.
