I wonder why either of these approaches have been taken.

      "\"Composition\" is a word that can mean several things, and without having read the original source I never really understood which version they mean.  As a rule, I've always viewed \"composition\" as \"gluing together things that don't know necessarily know about each other\", and that definition works well enough, but that doesn't necessarily eliminate inheritance.So then I start thinking in less-useful, more abstract definitions, like \"inheritance is vertical, composition is horizontal\", but of course that doesn't really mean anything.And at some point, it seems like I just end up defining \"composition\" to mean \"gluing together in a way that's not inheritance\".

      "Composition folks can get very dogmatic.I have some data types (structs or objects), that I want to serialize, persist, and that they have some common attributes of behaviors.In swift I can have each object to conform to Hashable, Identifiable, Codabele, etc etc...\nand keep repeating the same stuff over and over, or just create a base DataObject, and have the specific data object inherit it and just .In swift you can do it by both protocols, (and extensions of them), but after a while they start looking exactly like object inheritance, and nothing like commposition.Composition was preferred when many other languages didn't support object oriented out the gate (think Ada, Lua, etc), and tooling (IDEs) were primitive, but almost all modern languages do support it, and the tooling in insanely great.Composition is great when you have behaviour that can be widely different, depending on runtime conditions.  But, when you keep repeating yourself over and over by adopting the same protocols, perhaps you need some inheritance.The one negative of inheretance is that when you change some behaviour of a parent class, you need to do more refactoring as there could be other classes that depend on it. But, again, with today's IDEs and tooling, that is a lot easier.TLDR: Composition was preferred in a world where the languages didn't suport propper object inheretance out of the gate, and tooling and IDEs were still rudemmentary.reply"

For newly manufactured items and parts it has generally been my policy to buy parts from United States sellers even prior to the tariffs, mostly because that gets around various irregularities and it arrives more quickly. If they're going to drop-ship then it's their problem, not mine, because they advertised it was already here. Since such items are typically newly produced, the current tariffs would logically apply and this policy thus has the additional benefit of me not having to deal with that directly: any tariff should already have been paid to get them States-side.\n\nBut for NOS and used parts, especially if you are a collector like I am for certain systems, you buy where you can find them.

      "Epigenetics is one of those things that seems wild until you pull the camera back a bit. A cell is affected by and responds to its surroundings - this is not controversial. In eukaryotes, this is usually done by way of altering gene expression - up- or down-regulation by means of chemical markers on the cell\u2019s DNA which are created or removed by enzymes which are activated or deactivated by certain substances in the cell or its environment - in other words, the cell\u2019s environment affects gene regulation within the cell by traceable mechanisms*. All cells, save at least one, are descendent of other cells, and cells split by meiosis, in which the chemical environment within and without the cell is shared by the \u201cdescendent\u201d cell - so of course this happens with human embryos as well. Of course the expression of your genes is affected by what happened to your parents (well, your mother, at least), because gene expression is affected by what happens to a cell and you are made up of a lineage of cells descended from your mother\u2019s cells. If you ask how one organism could be affected by something it didn\u2019t experience, sure, that could be a quandary, but looking at a line of cells and wondering how later ones could be affected by environmental pressures on earlier ones isn\u2019t nearly as much of a mystery, and we\u2019re all just extended cell lineages.(As if first time mothers didn\u2019t have enough to worry about - stop stressing so much, it could lead to long-lasting irreversible changes to your fetus!)* Standard biology disclaimers: this is not the only way this happens, this varies across species and time, nature has no master plan. \u201cSome of the time some genes have some amount of their expression modified somewhat by some mechanisms that are somewhat responsive to some part of the cell\u2019s environment sometimes.\u201dreply",
      ">>> (As if first time mothers didn\u2019t have enough to worry about - stop stressing so much, it could lead to long-lasting irreversible changes to your fetus!)This is plainly not plausible. \"Irreversible\" doesn't play well with the length of time humans have been a thing.reply",

      "You definitely make a good point.But even reversible changes aren\u2019t always \u201creversed\u201d. They aren\u2019t necessarily minor.Sure, breaking an arm or  skipping high school can be a \u201creversible\u201d change.

      "> While the Murphy group consistently observed this attraction in their assays, the Hunter group generally did not (Kaletsky et al., 2025). The Vidal-Gadea group also observed that worms that had not been exposed to PA14 were initially attracted to it, suggesting that this is an important piece of the puzzle (Akinosho et al., 2025). Indeed, when tested directly, the Murphy group did not observe attraction using the temperature-shift method (Kaletsky et al., 2025). However, whether the omission of azide alone explains the discrepancy between the studies is not clear. In a handful of assays, the Hunter group used azide but failed to see the initial attraction to PA14, or to observe learned avoidance in the F2 generation.Every time I look into epigenetic inheritance studies I run into a lot of finicky experiments like this, where the outcomes appear to be highly dependent on several variables that aren\u2019t fully understood.One group of researchers claims to have pinned down the results, but as someone outside of this world trying to interpret the studies it\u2019s hard to know how well they\u2019ve really controlled these finicky experiments to isolate the single effect (epigenetic inheritance) that they claim explains everything.reply",

In 2019, Coleen Murphy and colleagues at Princeton University observed that learned avoidance of the PA14 strain of P. aeruginosa could be transmitted for up to four generations of C. elegans without new exposure to PA14 (Moore et al., 2019; Kaletsky et al., 2020). This transgenerational epigenetic inheritance allows animals that have never encountered PA14 to benefit from the experiences of previous generations.Recently, Craig Hunter and colleagues at Harvard University questioned the inheritance of learned avo"

      "Hi all, wow was not expecting this to be trending right now.I\u2019m the creator of Boa, you can catch my talk about it at JS Conf EU 2019 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uD2pijcSi4That said, today Boa has a whole team of maintainers who I\u2019m sure will answer some questions here.Yes the name does invoke the sense it\u2019s a Python project but I liked it and stuck with it, I saw a Boa snake at a zoo once and knew I wanted to name my next project after it, I was also inspired by Mozilla at the time who named their projects after animals.Speaking of Mozilla, Boa\u2019s existence came to be because at the time I was working on Servo and wanted to include an all-rust JS engine, one didn\u2019t really exist so I set about making one as a learning exercise, after around 2 years more joined me on that journey and today Boa is around 8 years old. It is not browser grade (although at 94.12% it is more compliant than some browser engines) but that doesn\u2019t matter, plenty of Rust projects have found good use for it as they find it easy to embed and use, so we\u2019re happy.One recent example is Biome who use it for their plugin infrastructure. https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/7300Another recent thing which we\u2019re very proud is seeing our implementation of Temporal be used in V8 and other engines, so we\u2019re also helping the wider ecosystem and raising all ships! (More here: https://boajs.dev/blog/2025/09/24/temporal-release)We do hope to improve performance over the next year or so, hopefully that answers some of the Qs here.reply",

      "Do you see catching up on performance with v8-jitless as a goal or is conformance the primary goal right now? Any plans on doing a JIT? I was always impressed by the idea of Truffle where you implement the language semantics once and you get both interpreter and JIT safely out of it which is a huge source of vulnerabilities in traditional JIT systemsreply",
      "Hi, I'm another one of the maintainers on the project.In general, we are shifting more to performance now than conformance. We currently sit at around 94% conformance, so there's not really that much more to go conformance-wise. The remaining conformance gains are a couple of the newer specification features and Intl related features. Our current conformance can be found at https://boajs.dev/conformance.Regarding performance, we are already making some gains, with hopefully more to come. The best example of this was probably the updates to script-bench-rs with our most recent release (which can be found at this commit https://github.com/khvzak/script-bench-rs/commit/d9635de77d2...). We still obviously have more to improve on, but we have already made some pretty steady progress from where we were.EDIT: I forgot to answer your question about v8-jitless. Obviously in the future it would be nice to be able to be more competitive with v8-jitless, but at least for me, I'd just like to focus on improving the Boa overall.reply",

      "So this is a bit loaded. Short answer: it can.Long answer: first, `fetch` is a runtime feature, and Boa is first and foremost an engine. So `boa_engine` -- the core project crate -- does not support `fetch` out of the box.That being said, we do have a `boa_runtime` crate. This crate is not currently a full runtime, but it is a collection of runtime features that have been implemented and can be registered onto the context. `fetch` is one of the features that has an implementation completed in `boa_runtime`, and it does use reqwest if I'm remembering correctly. If you're interested to see some example code of registering features, you can look at our CLI code as an example :)reply",

      "The issue with batteries on older iPhones isn't even replacing the battery. Apple will do it for like $80 bucks or so out of warranty. That's WAY cheaper than a new phone.But every new OS version manages to use more CPU and GPU and burn down that battery faster even if it's brand new, since the older chips have to work harder to run them than they had to work to run the older OSes.I replaced my battery which was showing around 83% of original capacity last year, in a 3-4 year old phone. I was skeptical of the 83% reported number. Nope. The new battery didn't last much longer, nowhere close to how long it lasted on the OS it shipped with.(This software-cpu-bloat is not unique to Apple. My Pixel, after 4 years or so, was practically unusable just from the amount of background shit the CPU was doing, compared to when it was new.)reply",

      ">  that's what shareholders wantWhat else could shareholders want? Employees, management, founders, customers, vendors could all have other goals, wants or desire but when you have a large number of shareholders that is what they want always.Shareholders - a large majority of them are institutional with their own shareholders they are accountable to, always want more money - that is a core principle of capitalism.Occasionally we can tie other objectives to financial gains to get a behave in a specific way, say a green initiative will improve the brand perception therefore brand value - because now they can charge more/ justify current pricing etc.It can at times align the other way too for risk minimization - a founder wants a large budget for something - like say Zuckerberg with Metaverse[3], or Musk with $1T pay [2] firing the founder is more expensive[1] so shareholders sign off.Fundamentally it always boils down to profit/value maximization for the shareholders.---[1] By no means unique, except for the scale of money spent on a vanity project.[2] Firing is more expensive - Tesla trades at such crazy multiples those are arguably not viable without Musk. It is probably cheaper to give then $1T pay package or the similar $56b package from 2018 currently being disputed in court.[3] Almost impossible in Meta's case. The board can fire the CEO in any company, but since Zuckerberg owns > 50% of the voting shares, he as the majority shareholder can also fire the board anytime and replace with a board who will sign off.  It is not absolute power though, there are some protections for minority shareholders as Delaware court is showing with 2018 Musk package case.reply",

If you need something fancier, the world seems to have settled on using React.I get that this is to let you render html on the backend and then stream it to the site so that JS can update the dom. But why? Genuine question; I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no good reason.reply",

      "Although the OP created it for SSR, these libraries are handy for SPAs as well.Rendering the whole DOM tree (instead of VDOMs) is a fast process. The slow part is attaching (committing) elements to the doc. e.g., I have a test of 20,000 elements which takes <30ms to render, while attaching them takes 120ms.Since the performance is mainly bound to the commit phase, libraries like these (and hopefuly a native API) help for creating simple UI frameworks. For example, a helper such as:  function createElement(tag, props, ...children) {\n    const elem = document.createElement(tag)\n    for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(props || {}))\n           if (k === 'ref')        v.elem = elem\n      else if (k === 'style')      Object.assign(elem.style, v)\n      else if (k.startsWith('on')) elem.addEventListener(k.slice(2).toLowerCase(), ...[v].flat())\n      else if (k in elem)          elem[k] = v\n      else                         elem.setAttribute(k, v)\n    elem.append(...children.flat().filter(Boolean))\n    return elem\n  }\n\n\n\ncould be used, like:    function ResetButton() {\n       return (\n         r('button', {\n           className: CSS.ResetButton,\n           onClick: store.reset\n         }, 'Reset'))\n    }\n\n    function render() {\n      document.body.replaceChildren(App())) // but mergeChildren\n    }\n\n\nHere's an example of using that helper:https://github.com/ericfortis/mockaton/blob/main/src/client/...reply",

Adding link prefetching algo on top of the that and it will seem even faster.If anything it removes a ton of the argument for using React absent maybe a small subset of highly complex UI subcomponents which may need it, but rarely required for a whole SaaS app. Frontend teams just want React so they can use a single tool not because it's the best solution.reply",

      "Tossing Linux on used enterprise laptops is maybe the best bang for your buck machine you can get. They're often time a great value and within three years old. Used multiple Thinkpads and Dells over the years that were fantastic and gotten sub $400.Things I learned to look out for:- Locked BIOS- Look into the manufacturer's repairability reputation. I replaced the entire keyboard on my ThinkPad X1 Carbon and it was perfectly fine. It was a pain to get to, but no problems. On a Dell Latitude, it refused to charge my non-OEM battery replacement. My fault - I should've done some research.In my experience, Dell and Lenovo have excellent Linux hardware support. I don't know about other manufacturers, but I hope that that's also the case now too.reply",
      "Can back this. Many years ago I purchased a Dell Latitude from eBay. After messing around with a 3D printer, there was a short of mains voltage onto the USB line, frying the laptop and tripping the house electrics. I contacted Dell asking for a schematic of the PCBs thinking that I had blown some components, but they informed me that the laptop was still under warranty thanks to the original business purchaser (by just a few weeks).They shipped a box and allowed me to swap out a hard drive for a spare (I had study data on there), I then used the box to ship the laptop to them. A few weeks later the laptop gets shipped back with a parts replacement list, which was essentially every single PCB in the laptop and I asked them to replace the keyboard too because one key was sticking. Brand new parts in a slightly cracked chassis.If Dell still has customer service like that, it's double thumbs up from me.I'm currently using a Lenovo laptop which has been solid so far. I do want my next laptop to be open to repairability (even if I have to create it myself).reply",
      "Dell customer service is whatever someone wants to pay for.I bought a new Dell laptop 20-ish years ago along with whatever the super-duper coverage was called at that time (Complete Care, maybe?).  IIRC, it only excluded deliberate damage (and \"hammer marks\" was used as an example).But they had no trouble sending me parts.  Power brick soaked in a flood?  No big deal; a new one is on the way.  Dropped a screwdriver on the screen at work?  They sent a whole person over to replace it.It was very expensive coverage -- it cost more by itself than the used/refurb laptops we're discussing. It was sold separately.  It did not, by my estimation around that time, ultimately pay for itself.But if you score it for \"free\" with a used machine, then sure!  Bargain!(A person can check the warranty/service status of an unmolested Dell machine here:  https://www.dell.com/support/contractservices/en-us )reply",

      "> Things I learned to look out for:Don't buy any recent Intels. Some Intel ThinkPads have accelerometers built-in just to throttle your PC to oblivion when it moves. Basically unusable in any moving vehicle such as a train. It's basically anti-portability baked-in.When it doesn't throttle, it just has abysmal battery life compared to AMD Ryzen ThinkPads of the same generation. Both lose horribly to Apple's ARM chips though.They also tend to have soldered WiFi modules, making it impossible to upgrade later when newer and better WiFi iterations come out. If that had been the case with a few of the older models I still have, they would be unusable at this point.There are plenty of firmware bugs as well. For example plenty of Lenovo (especially Intel as far as I've seen) models have stuttery and freezing touchpads. Though the touchpads tend to be horrible anyways.I'd say the older (5+ years old) generations might have had slightly better driver support or they're finally fixed at this point.
