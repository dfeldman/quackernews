This proposal, embedded in the proposed fiscal year 2026 budget, has sparked bipartisan opposition in Congress and concern among industry groups.\u00a0Established in 1990 and operational since 1998, the CSB is an independent federal agency tasked with investigating industrial chemical accidents. Headquartered in Washington, DC, the agency's board members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

The Rubin does much more \"wide\" seeing and this actually produces a ton of useful data- basically, enough data to collect reliable statistics about things.  This helps refine cosmological models in ways that smaller individual observations cannot.What's amazing to me is just how long it took to get to first photo- I was working on the design of the LSST scope well over 10 years ago, and the project had been underway for some time before that.

Sydney's more expensive/onerous licensing requirements were prohibitive for tiny bars.

Liquor licenses are distributed by the state at a capped amount that can potentially be increased each year, meaning the majority of new businesses wanting to have alcohol sales will need to purchase an existing liquor license from another business, often at an exorbitant price (over 500k USD on average I believe)This makes it extremely difficult for any new businesses to start, and massively advantages large chain businesses that have the ability to make the initial investment in securing a license, versus small or quirky businesses which just have no chance getting started.\n \nreply",

      "I briefly worked at a YC company that was a ruby shop. Their answer to every performance problem was to stick it on a queue. There were, I don\u2019t know, dozens of them. Then they decided they needed to be multi-region, because reasons. But the queues weren\u2019t set up to be multi-region, so they built an entirely new service that\u2019s job was to decide which queue in which region jobs needed to go on. So now you had jobs crisscrossing datacenters and tracking any issue became literally impossible. Massively turned me off to both that company and ruby in general.\n \nreply",
      "I'm going to be brave (but still use a throwaway) and ask the dumb question - what is wrong with putting things in queues to help with performance problems?If some endpoint is too slow to return a response to the frontend within a reasonable time, enqueueing it via a worker makes sense to me.That doesn't cover all performance issues but it handles a lot of them. You should also do things like optimize SQL queries, cache in redis or the db, perhaps run multiple threads within an endpoint, etc. but I don't see anything wrong with specifically having dozens of workers/queues. We have that in my work's Rails app.Happy to hear how I can do things better if I'm missing something.\n \nreply",
      "You\u2019re not missing anything and are correct in that there are plenty of reasons to use queues and defer work that can be handled asynchronously outside of a request/response.

      "Queues have several problems\n- if the caller is http it may timeout and retry, leading to more jobs being queued\n- the caller may no longer care because it took so long and the work is wasted\n- if the caller is called from a queue it can cause cascades \n- you can fill a disk up and crash the system\n \nreply",

      "Resque was a staple for a long long time. In the jvm world, throw everything into Kafka is also a staple of a lot of \"enterprise\" shops. Or SQS for AWS places I've worked at. I think it is not a ruby language thing, but a certain kind of architecture thing.\n \nreply",
      "True that it is not uncommon to use Sidekiq or Resque , but Rails 8 is going to be the first version to ship with a queuing system (SolidQueue), later this year. So queueing has been an add-on for 20 years. I don't think it is quite a staple."

      "FPGAs are an amazing product that almost shouldn't exist if you think about the business and marketing concerns. They are a product that is too expensive at scale. If an application takes off, it is eventually cheaper and more performant to switch to ASICs, which is obvious when you see the 4-digit prices of the most sophisticated FPGAs.Given how ruinously expensive silicon products are to bring to market, it's amazing that there are multiple companies competing (albeit in distinct segments).FPGAs also seem like a largely untapped domain in general purpose computing, a bit like GPUs used to be. The ability to reprogram an FPGA to implement a new digital circuit in milliseconds would be a game changer for many workloads, except that current CPUs and GPUs are already very capable.\n \nreply",
      "For a while in the 2000s Cisco was one of the biggest users of FPGAs.  If you consider how complicated digital designs have been for many decades, and the costs of associated failures, FPGAs can certainly be cost neutral at scale, especially accounting for risk and reputational damage, into production lines.Also there is a large gamut and pretty much always has been for decades of programmable logic.. some useful parts are not much more than a mid range microcontroller.  The top end is for DoD, system emulation, novel frontier/capture regimes (like \"AI\", autonomous vehicles).. few people ever work on those compared to the cheaper parts.\n \nreply",
      "FPGAs are still quite common in niche hardware like oscilloscopes or cell towers, where the manufacturer needs some sophisticated hardware capabilities but isn't manufacturing enough units to make the NRE for an ASIC worthwhile.\n \nreply",
      "//If an application takes off, it is eventually cheaper and more performant to switch to ASICs,That's part of the FPGA business model - they have an automated way to take an FPGA design and turn it into a validated semi-custom ASIC, at low NRE, at silicon nodes(10nm?) you wouldn't have access to otherwise.And all of that at a much lower risk. This is a strong rational but also emotional appeal. And people are highly influenced by that.\n \nreply",
      "Is this still an active thing? My understanding is that both Xilinx and Altera/Intel have effectively discontinued their ASIC programs (Xilinx EasyPath, Altera HardCopy); they aren't available for modern part families.For what it's worth, Xilinx EasyPath was never actually ASIC. The parts delivered were still FPGAs; they were just FPGAs with a reduced testing program focusing on functionality used by the customer's design.\n \nreply",
      "I'd be amazed if that were still possible, in fact.  Real-world FPGA designs lean heavily on the vendor's proprietary IP, which won't port straight across to ASICs any more than the LUT-based FPGA fabric will.Anyone who claims to turn a modern FPGA design into an ASIC \"automatically\" is selling snake oil.\n \nreply",
      "Oh, these programs were always in-house. The offering was essentially \"if you pay an up-front fee and give us your FPGA design, we'll sell you some chips that run that design for cheaper than the FPGAs\". If there was ever any custom silicon involved - which there may have been for Altera, but probably not for Xilinx - the design files for it were never made available to the customer.\n \nreply",
      "> The ability to reprogram an FPGA to implement a new digital circuit in milliseconds would be a game changer for many workloadsSomeone has to design each of those reconfigurable digital circuits and take them through an implementation flow.Only certain problems map well to easy FPGA implementation: anything involving memory access is quite tedious.\n \nreply",
      "The problem is that the tools are still weak. The languages are difficult to use, nobody has made something more widely adopted than Verilog or VHDL. In addition, the IDEs are proprietary and the tools are fragile and not reproduceable. Synthesis results can vary from run to run on the exact same code with the same parameters, with real world impacts on performance. This all conspires to make FPGA development only suitable for bespoke products with narrow use cases.I would love to see the open source world come to the rescue here. There are some very nice open source tools for Lattice FPGAs and Lattice's lawyers have essentially agreed to let the open source tools continue unimpeded (they're undoubtedly driving sales), but the chips themselves can't compete with the likes of Xilinx.\n \nreply",

      "Reads very similar to some blackouts we had in Australia. Weakly connected grids with vast geographical distances leading to oscillations that took down the grid.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_South_Australian_blackoutCompletely solved with lithium based grid storage at key locations btw. This grid storage has also been massively profitable for it's owners https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsdale_Power_Reserve#Revenu...Australia currently has 4 of the 5 largest battery storage systems under construction as a result of this profit opportunity; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_energy_storage_system#...You can also read numerous stories of how Australia's lithium ion grid storage systems have prevented blackouts in many cases. https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-big-battery-south-australia-... The fact is that the batteries responsiveness is the fastest of any system at correcting gaps like this. 50/60hz is nothing for a lithium ion battery nor are brief periods of multi-gigawatt draw/dumping as needed.There's even articles that if Europe investing in battery storage systems like Australia they'd have avoided this. https://reneweconomy.com.au/no-batteries-no-flexibility-spai...\n \nreply",
      "> nor are brief periods of multi-gigawatt draw/dumping as needed.Actually this is typically an issue for grid batteries.Spinning generators can easily briefly go to 10x the rated current for a second or so to smooth out big anomalies.Stationary batteries inverters can't do 10x current spikes ever - the max they can get to is more like 1.2x for a few seconds.That means you end up needing a lot of batteries to provide the same spinning reserve as one regular power station.\n \nreply",
      "Collectively Australia's battery storage systems will be able to beat any single power plant for peak output in Australia once fully built out based on pure numbers. But for these sorts of grid oscillations the more important thing is the localization of generation. Which obviously favours the batteries over large centralized power stations in any case.\n \nreply",
      "A spinning generator is not outputting 10x it's rated current over any significant amount of time. You can only add so much steam or fuel to a turbine, and the rotor has a lot of inertia, but not enough to account for 10X its rated capacity for a second. The electrical switchyards would trip nearly instantaneously if it's connected plant output 10X its rated input.\n \nreply",
      "Let alone the transmission lines totally catching fire after a 10X output increase.\n \nreply",
      "You can if the load was 10x under max. before getting tripped.Misaligned oscillation can occurs under ANY load.\n \nreply",

      "That... doesn't sound correct.  Inverters are the cheap part, you can literally wire as many as you want in parallel.  Batteries have immense power availability, with most chemistries you can trivially deliver the entire capacity in half an hour or so (more like 5 minutes with lithium cells).Basically I'm dubious.  I'm sure there are grids somewhere that have misprovisioned their inverter capacity, but I don't buy that battery facilities are inherently unable to buffer spikes.

For every fancy titled exploit there are twenty that you've never heard of.You can sort of do it if you carefully structure your program to restrict syscall use and then use some minimal and well audited syscall filtering layer to hide most of the kernel. But you really have to know what you're doing and proper security hardening will break a lot of software. To get a basic level of security, you have to disable anything with the letters \"BPF\", hide all virtual filesystems like /proc, /sys, disable io_uring and remove every CONFIG_* you see until something stops working. Some subsystems seem more vulnerable than others (ironically netfilter seems to be a steady source of vulnerabilities).\n \nreply",
      "> they should really look at kernel CVE databaseWhen quoting kernel CVEs as evidence as signs of insecurity, especially so seemingly authoritatively, please make sure you're informed about how what Linux kernel CVEs mean.A CVE (for any product) does not automatically mean there is actually a vulnerability there or even if one is exploitable unless explicitly noted (in the CVE or credibly by someone else). Proof of concepts, reproducibility or even any kind of verification are not a part of the CVE process.For the Linux kernel in particular, the CVE process is explicitly to be \"overly cautious\" [1]. In practice, this means the Linux security team requests a CVE for anything that has a mere whiff of being theoretically exploitable. Of course that doesn't mean that the bug that was fixed was actually exploitable, not even theoretically but certainly not in practice.As a result, you can't use CVEs reported by the Linux kernel to make claims about the (lack of) practical security of any Linux system, including your desktop. The CVEs reported by the Linux kernel are there to notify you to very well informed users of the kernel to do further risk assessments, not to be taken at face value as a sign of insecurity.

When booting up on a \"dirty\" filesystem, there's a prompt to power down or press any key to bypass the integrity check. This has a two minute timeout, which is just a ridiculous amount of time to wait. (Also, pressing buttons doesn't actually seem to work to bypass the integrity check)2. After a power cycle - regardless of whether the power-down was clean or dirty - you lose everything on the microSD other than the OS itself. All settings, all downloaded themes, all ROMs completely wiped. It's as if it's booting from a recovery partition or something. I tried numerous times (gracefully shutting down via the Start-button menu) and each time, it boots back up all wiped clean. Reimaged and started over from scratch - still the same issue.The sleep issue seems to be a known thing and newer version will fix this by... removing the ability to sleep (see https://github.com/ROCKNIX/distribution/issues/1609).Didn't see anything about the \"clean\" (more like \"forcibly-sterilized\") slate after power cycling.Not ready for the big leagues, at least not on the CubeXX.\n \nreply",

It's just a bit frustrating, especially because (imo) the Anbernic H700 devices are the ones most deeply in need of a solid custom firmware / OS option. The version of Retroarch included in the stock OS is lacking some pretty standard cores (no INTV, no Colecovision, no Speccy, no 3DO, and that's just the \"tier 2\"s that come to mind, not doing a deep dive into the even-more obscure stuff like the Sharp systems or CDi). And the default Ambernic OS itself is, charitably, \"not-great\" (why are there two entirely-separate menus to browse games from, why can't I re-scan without rebooting, the list goes on and on and on...)> What you're describing does sound like a bug, it might be that some flag is set incorrectly.Yeah, hopefully this isn't intended behavior. The ROMs are being dumped right in the appropriate directories (I tried both \"roms-internal\" and the third option that isn't \"roms-external\" - forgot the name and already wiped the card). And the themes are downloaded and installed solely through the frontend, I'm not doing anything too obscure or beardy.It even does this on a fresh install, so the default theme is immediately replaced with the... even-more-default...? theme. That definitely threw me for a loop on the first go-round. The \"more-default-than-default\" theme actually doesn't look too bad (sort of has a Cosmic Smash [1] vibe), but a lot of text breaks outside the confines of its boxes and it lacks any cursor highlighting in menus, so without screenshots you have no idea which option (or game) you're selecting.> I would recommend dropping in at the Discord.I don't use Discord, but I'm happy to file Github issues as long as you think it'd be non-redundant / a productive use of my time. Otherwise, by all means feel free to link my comments in the Discord![1] https://imgur.com/a/xQdepbN\n \nreply",
      "Nice to see another alternative to the Linux gaming ecosystem. Bazzite also states handheld device support: https://bazzite.gg/\n \nreply",
      "Not seeing the point of this, all that much. I'd rather run something like Mobian or pmOS (given the tiny, mobile-like screen on most of these devices) once the hardware support on mainline kernel is up to proper standards.  A lightweight environment like sxmo would probably work quite well with the custom HID controls.  And it would open up this whole emerging class of low-cost devices for doing a whole lot more than just the emulator-based \"gaming\" that they're used for out-of-the-box.(Not all of them are low-cost, either; there's plenty of high-end handhelds with physical buttons and analog controls these days, that could probably be usefully repurposed for productive work.)\n \nreply",
      "The upside of this is I can point my semi-technical but not Linux savvy parent at it and say \"Press the install button\".As much as I love pmOS, it's just not there unfortunately.\n \nreply",
      "Does Mobian work without a touch screen? Most of the kinds of devices Rocknix supports don't have one. Rocknix has a nice emulator front end out of the box, a media player, etc. and it all works with the game pad controls.\n \nreply"
