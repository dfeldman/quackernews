      "It\u2019s very odd when mainframes (S/3x0, Cray, yadda yadda) have been extensively water-cooled for over 50 years, and super-dense HPC data centers have used liquid cooling for at least 20, to hear Google-scale data center design compared to PC hobbyist rigs. Selective amnesia + laughably off-target point of comparison.reply",
      "[bri3d pointed out that I missed an element of this. There is a transfer between rack level and machine level coolant which makes this far less novel than I had initially understood. See their direct comment to this]I posed this further down in a reply-to-a-reply but I should call it out a little closer to the top: The innovation here is not \u201cwe are using water for cooling\u201d. The innovation here is that they are direct cooling the servers with chillers that are outside of the facility. Most mainframes will use water cooling to get the heat from the core out to the edges where traditional where it can be picked up by the typical heatsink/cooling fans. Even home PCs do this by moving the heat to a reservoir that can be more effectively cooled.What Google is doing is using the huge chillers that would normally be cooling the air in the facility to cool water which is directly pumped into every server. The return water is then cooled in the chiller tower. This eliminates ANY air based transfer besides the chiller tower. This is one being done a server or a rack.. its being done on the whole data center all at once.I am super curious how they handle things like chiller maintenance or pump failures. I am sure they have redundancy but the system for that has to be super impressive because it can\u2019t be offline long before you experience hardware failure![Edit: It was pointed out in another comment that AWS is doing this as well and honestly their pictures make it way clearer what is happening: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-liquid-cooling-data...]reply",
      "I don't think this comment is accurate based on the article, although you cite personal experience elsewhere so maybe your project wasn't the one that's documented here?> What Google is doing is using the huge chillers that would normally be cooling the air in the facility to cool water which is directly pumped into every server.From the article:> CDUs exchange heat between coolant liquid and the facility-level water supply.Also, I know from attaching them at some point that plenty of mainframes used this exact same approach (water to water exchange with facility water), not water to air to water like you describe in this comment and others, so I think you may have just not had experience there? https://www.electronics-cooling.com/2005/08/liquid-cooling-i... contains a diagram in Figure 1 of this exact CDU architecture, which it claims was in use in mainframes dating back to 1965 (!).I also don't think \"This eliminates ANY air based transfer besides the chiller tower.\" is strictly true; looking at the photo of the sled in the article, there are fans. The TPUs are cooled by the liquid loop but the ancillaries are still air cooled. This is typical for water cooling systems in my experience; while I wouldn't be surprised to be wrong (it sure would be more efficient, I'd think!), I've never seen a water cooling system which successfully works without forced air, because there are just too many ancillary components of varying shapes to successfully design a PCB-waterblock combination which does not also demand forced air cooling.reply",
      "> > CDUs exchange heat between coolant liquid and the facility-level water supply.Oh interesting I missed that when I went through in the first pass. (I think I space bared to pass the image and managed to skip the entire paragraph in between the two images so that\u2019s on me.I was running off an informal discussion I had with a hardware ops person several years ago where he mentioned a push to unify cooling and eliminate thermal transfer points since they were one of the major elements of inefficiency in modern cooling solutions. By missing that as I browsed through it I think I leaned too heavily on my assumptions without realizing it!Also, not all chips can be liquid cooled so there will always be an element of air cooling so the fans and stuff are still there for the \u201ceverything else\u201d cases and I doubt anybody will really eliminate that effectively. The comment you quoted was mostly directed towards the idea that Cray-1 had liquid cooling, it did, but it transferred to air outside of the server which was an extremely common model for most older mainframe setups. It was rare for the heat to be kept liquid along the whole path.reply",
      "The CDUs are essentially just passive water to water heat exchangers with some fancy electronics attached. You want to run a different chemical mix outside to the chillers as you do on the internal loop, it also helps regulate flow/pressure and leak detection with auto cutoff is all fairly essential.Running direct on facility water would made day to day operations and maintenance a total pain.reply",
      "> not all chips can be\n    > liquid cooled.\n\nWhy not? It's just a heatsink except with water running through cavities within it, instead of a fan sitting on top of the heatsink.reply",
      "It's interesting because I've never seen mainframes do water to water (though I'm sure that was possible).The only ones I've ever seen do water to compressor (then gas to the outdoor condenser, obviously)reply",
      "Most ES/9000 series and earlier stuff had water to water SKUs. I remember seeing an installation with one that exchanged heat into a facility loop which went through another water to water exchanger to a pond-fountain chiller system.Starting with S/390 G4 they did a weird thing where the internals were cooled by refrigeration but the standard SKUs actually had the condenser in the bottom of the cabinet and they required raised floor cooling.They brought water to air back with the later zSeries, but the standard SKUs mimicked the S/390 strategy with raised floor. I guess you could buy a z196 or a ec12 with a water to water cabinet but I too have never seen one.reply",

      "From what I read in the comments of the first post, the Pyon guy seems very toxic and pedantic, but the rebuttal by Ned isn't great. For example, nowhere in the rebuttal is the pedantic technical detail ever actually described. In fact the prose reads very awkwardly in order to circumlocute around describing it, just repeatedly naming it \"particular detail\". In my view, the author overreaches: he dismisses Pyon not only for the delivery of his criticism (which was toxic) but also the content of his criticism (why?).Ultimately Ned is in the right about empathy and communication online. But as an educator it would have been nice to hear, even briefly, why he thought Pyon's point was unnecessarily technical and pedantic? Instead he just says \"I've worked for decades and didn't know it\". No one is too experienced to learn.EDIT: I just skimmed the original comment section between Pyon and Ned and it seems that Ned is rather diplomatic and intellectually engages with Pyon's critique. Why is this level of analysis completely missing from the follow-up blogpost? I admit to not grasping the technical details or importance, personally, it would be nice to hear a summarized analysis...reply",

The high-level compilation pipeline diagram is... wrong? Like, Clang-AST is definitely part of clang frontend, and you get to the optimization pipeline, which clearly fucks up the flow through vectorization and instruction selection (completely omitting GlobalISel as well too, for that matter). The choice of backends to highlight is weird, and at the end of the day, it manages to completely omit some of the most important passes in LLVM (like InstCombine).Drilling down into the other pages... I mean at no point does it even discuss or give an idea of what LLVM IR. There's nothing about the pass manager, nothing about expected canonicalization of passes. It's got a weird fixation about some things (like the role of TargetLowering), but manages to elide pretty much any detail that is actually useful. The role of TableGen in several components is completely missing--and FWIW, understanding TableGen and its error messages is probably the single hardest part of putting together an LLVM backend, precisely the thing you'd want it to focus on.If I had to guess, it's overly fixated on things that happen to be very large files--I think everything it decided to focus on in a single page happens to be a 30kloc file or something. But that means it also misses the things that are so gargantuan they're split into multiple files--Clang codegen is ~100kloc and InstCombine is ~40kloc but since they're in several 4-5kloc files instead of a large 26kloc file (SLPVectorizer) or 62kloc file (X86ISelLowering), they're simply not considered important and ignored.reply",

      "Definitely seems like it could be useful, but I'd be worried with giving AI write access to emails.Is there a good audit trail of exactly what actions it takes at each step? I'd personally be worried about leaking proprietary or otherwise private information this way, or having it hallucinate information when it sends out emails potentially causing catastrophic issues.reply",
      "Valid concern - April does not write emails for you unless you specifically ask for it. Users usually dictate what they want to reply.But do you think a 'safe mode' - where April does only non destructive operation like read/summarize/draft/move emails to a folder would help you build trust?It's in our pipeline - we can prioritize it to mitigate that fear.reply",
      "I started building basically April last week. I have a \"safety\" toggle in my app. If it's on, there's a \"Review Actions\" tab that any write or destructive actions go to. Then when I'm done dictating/commuting/whatever, I open the Review tab and go through the actions (add this calendar event, send this text message, reply to this email, etc) one by one - it sort of works like a checklist.Feel free to take the idea, if it's helpful. No credit/rights necessary. Y'all are much farther along than I am and if you come out with an Android app I'll probably end up a customer!reply",
      "Yes, a safe mode would be great.  I think it's a \"nice to have\" for a lot of early adopter (type of people who read HN), but it will be a \"must have\" more corporate types (a much bigger market).reply",
      "> April does not write emails for you unless you specifically ask for it.What if it thinks you asked for it?reply",
      "Feels pretty easy to mitigate against. If a user deselects \"allow email sending\", then you can just remove that as a possible tool-call so it becomes impossible.reply",
      "Absolutely, having the AI agent write out a draft and leave it there, or better yet grant it read-only access to my email and have it draft email responses and store it somewhere else where I can retrieve it would be fantastic.AI is still not at the point where I am comfortable letting it run free with my email, but a draft that I can read over and make changes to before sending it out is a game changer.reply",
      "Yes, think this needs to be way up on your priority list.reply",
      "Safe mode is absolutely necessary. I'd never let an LLM do things for me. They repeatedly prove that they categorically can't be jailed or trusted.reply",
      "I love the idea (also wondering when Google would build this)But the situation where emails are backing upload as you drive to work and back to back meetings sounds like a mismanaged workplace.The real impact (not a startup idea really) is fixing whatever makes the workplace like that. Usually everyone needs to be involved in everything and bad meeting management. Could be bad prioritisation and taking on too much work. Could be busywork.If AI could solve those problems or help it might be good.reply"
