      "The author has a knack for generating buzz (and making technically interesting inventions) :)I'm a little concerned that no one (besides the author?) has checked the implementation to see if reducing the attack surface in one area (memory security) might cause problems in other layers.For example, Filip mentioned that some setuid programs can be compiled with it, but it also makes changes to ld.so. I pointed this out to the author on Twitter, as it could be problematic. Setuid applications need to be written super-defensively because they can be affected by envars, file descriptors (e.g. there could be funny logical bugs if fd=1/2 is closed for a set-uid app, and then it opens something, and starts using printf(), think about it:), rlimits, and signals. The custom modifications to ld.so likely don't account for this yet?In other words, these are still teething problems with Fil-C, which will be reviewed and fixed over time. I just want to point out that using it for real-world \"infrastructures\" might be somewhat risky at this point. We need unix nerds to experiment with.OTOH, it's probably a good idea to test your codebase with it (provided it compiles, of course) - this phase could uncover some interesting problems (assuming there aren't too many false positives).reply",

      "Yes, but instead of remarking solely on the fact that the author has a pretty good turnaround time for fixing bugs (I wished all open source projects were that fast) and listens to input belies the tone of your comment, which makes me come away with a negative view of the project, when in fact the evidence points to the opposite.It's a 'damning with faint praise' thing and I'm not sure to what degree you are aware of it but I don't think it is a fair way to treat the author and the project.

It's a fantastic piece of work (I reviewed some part of it) that will very likely play an important role in the future - it's simply too good not to.At the same time, however, the author seems to be operating on the principle: \"If I don't make big claims, no one will notice.\" The statements about the actual security benefits should be independently verified -this hasn't happened yet, but it probably will, as the project is gaining increasing attention.reply",

Folks other than me have independently verified my claims, just not exhaustively. No memory safe language runtime has been exhaustively verified, save maybe Spark.

If it wasn't your intention to be negative then maybe it is my non-native English capability that is the cause of this but even upon re-reading it that's how I perceive it.- You start off with commenting that the author has a knack for self promotion and invention. My impression is that he's putting in a status report for a project that is underway.- you follow this up with something that you can't possibly know and use that to put the project down, whilst at the same time positioning yourself as a higher grade authority because you are apparently able to see something that others do not, effectively doing that which you accuse the author of: self promotion.- You then double down on this by showing that it was you who pointed out to the author that there was a bug in the software, which in the normal course of open source development is not usually enough to place yourself morally or technically above the authors.- You then in your more or less official capacity of established critic warn others to hold off putting this project to the test until 'adults' have reviewed it.- And then finally you suggest they do it anyway, with your permission this time (and of course now amply warned) with the implicit assumption that problems will turn up (most likely this will be the case) and that you hope 'there won't be too many false positives', strongly suggesting that there might be.And in your comment prior to this reply you do that once again, making statements that put words in the mouth of the author.reply",

The OS will allow this program to overwrite any file that the user has access to. This program can be quite dangerous even if it is memory safe. Worse, imagine that the program didn't have any code to open files for reading and writing, but also had no sandbox to prevent those syscalls from working. If there was a bug in the memory safety enforcement of this program (say, because of a bug in the Java implementation), then an attacker could cause this program to overwrite any file if they succeeded at achieving code execution via weird "

      "> Once the code for all destinations lived in a single repo, they could be merged into a single service. With every destination living in one service, our developer productivity substantially improved. We no longer had to deploy 140+ services for a change to one of the shared libraries. One engineer can deploy the service in a matter of minutes.If you must to deploy every service because of a library change, you don't have services, you have a distributed monolith. The entire idea of a \"shared library\" which must be kept updated across your entire service fleet is antithetical to how you need to treat services.reply",
      "I think your point while valid, it is probably a lot more nuanced. From the post it's more akin to an Amazon shared build and deployment system than \"every library update needs to redeploy every time scenario\".It's likely there's a single source of truth where you pull libraries or shared resources from, when team A wants to update the pointer to library-latest to 2.0 but the current reference of library-latest is still 1.0, everyone needs to migrate off of it otherwise things will break due to backwards compatibility or whatever.Likewise, if there's a -need- to remove a version for a vulnerability or what have you, then everyone needs to redeploy, sure, but the centralized benefit of this likely outweighs the security cost and complexity of tracking the patching and deployment process for each and every service.I would say those systems -are- and likely would be classified as micro services but from a cost and ease perspective operate within a shared services environment. I don't think it's fair to consider this style of design decision as a distributed monolith.By that level of logic, having a singular business entity vs 140 individual business entities for each service would mean it's a distributed monolith.reply",

If you do find yourself in a situation where you can't upgrade a core library like e.g. SQLAlchemy or Spring, or the underlying Python/Java/Go/etc runtime, without requiring updates to every service, you are back in the realm of a distributed monolith.reply",
      "This is explicitly called out in the blog post in the trade-offs section.I was one of the engineers who helped make the decisions around this migration. There is no one size fits all.

      "> There is no one size fits all.Totally agree. For what it's worth, based on the limited information in the article, I actually do think it was the right decision to pull all of the per-destination services back into one. The shared library problem can go both ways, after all: maybe the solution is to remove the library so your microservices are fully independent, or maybe they really should have never been independent in the first place and the solution is to put them back together.I don't think either extreme of \"every line of code in the company is deployed as one service\" or \"every function is an independent FaaS\" really works in practice, it's all about finding the right balance, which is domain-specific every time.reply",
      "The dependencies they're likely referring to aren't core libraries, they're shared interfaces. If you're using protobufs, for instance, and you share the interfaces in a repo. Updating Service A's interface(s) necessitates all services dependent on communicating with it to be updated as well (whether you utilize those changes or not). Generally for larger systems, but smaller/scrappier teams, a true dependency management tree for something like this is out of scope so they just redeploy everything in a domain.reply",
      ">  If you're using protobufs, for instance, and you share the interfaces in a repo. Updating Service A's interface(s) necessitates all services dependent on communicating with it to be updated as well (whether you utilize those changes or not).This is not true! This is one of the core strengths of protobuf. Non-destructive protobuf changes, such as adding new API methods or new fields, do not require clients to update. On the server-side you do need to handle the case when clients don't send you the new data--plus deal with the annoying \"was this int64 actually set to 0 or is it just using the default?\" problem--but as a whole you can absolutely independently update a protobuf, implement it on the server, and existing clients can keep on calling and be totally fine.Now, that doesn't mean you can go crazy, as doing things like deleting fields, changing field numbering or renaming APIs will break clients, but this is just the reality of building distributed systems.reply",
      "I disagree. Both can be true at the same time. A good design should not point to library-latest in a production setting, it should point to a stable known good version via direct reference, i.e library-1.0.0-stable.However, the world we live in, people choose pointing to latest, to avoid manual work and trust other teams did the right diligence when updating to the latest version.You can point to a stable version in the model I described and still be distributed and a micro service, while depending on a shared service or repository.reply",
      "You can do that but you keep missing that you\u2019re no longer a true microservice as originally defined and envisioned, which is that you can deploy the service independently under local control.Can you imagine if Google could only release a new API if all their customers simultaneously updated to that new API? You need loose coupling between services.OP is correct that you are indeed now in a weird hybrid monolith application where it\u2019s deployed piecemeal but can\u2019t really be deployed that way because of tightly coupled dependencies.Be ready for a blog post in ten years how they broke apart the monolith into loosely coupled components because it was too difficult to ship things with a large team and actually have it land in production without getting reverted to an unrelated issue.reply",
      "Internal and external have wildly different requirements. Google internally can't update a library unless the update is either backward-compatible for all current users or part of the same change that updates all those users, and that's enforced by the build/test harness. That was an explicit choice, and I think an excellent one, for that scenario: it's more important to be certain that you're done when you move forward, so that it's obvious when a feature no longer needs support, than it is to enable moving faster in \"isolation\" when you all work for the same company anyway.But also, you're conflating code and services. There's a huge difference between libraries that are deployed as part of various binaries and those that are used as remote APIs. If you want to update a utility library that's used by importing code, then you don't need simultaneous deployment, but you would like to update everywhere to get it done with - that's only really possible with a monorepo. If you want to update a remote API without downtime, then you need a multi-phase rollout where you introduce a backward-compatibility mode... but that's true whether you store the code in one place or two.reply"

      "Gleam is a beautiful language, and what I wish Elixir would become (re:typing).For those that don't know its also built upon OTP, the erlang vm that makes concurrency and queues a trivial problem in my opinion.Absolutely wonderful ecosystem.I've been wanting to make Gleam my primary language, but I fear LLMs have frozen programming language advancement and adoption for anything past 2021.But I am hopeful that Gleam has slid just under the closing door and LLMs will get up to speed on it fast.reply",
      "> For those that don't know its also built upon OTP, the erlang vmThis isn't correct.  It can compile to run on the BEAM: that is the Erlang VM.  OTP isn't the Erlang VM; rather, \"OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to develop [concurrent/distributed/fault tolerant] systems.\"Gleam itself provides what I believe is a substantial subset of OTP support via a library: https://github.com/gleam-lang/otpImportantly: \"Gleam has its own version of OTP which is type safe, but has a smaller feature set. [vs. Elixir, another BEAM language with OTP support]\"reply",
      "Hi, I\u2019m the creator of Gleam!The comment you are replying to is correct, and you are incorrect.All OTP APIs are usable as normal within Gleam, the language is designed with it in mind, and there\u2019s an additional set of Gleam specific additions to OTP (which you have linked there).Gleam does not have access to only a subset of OTP, and it does not have its own distinct OTP inspired OTP. It uses the OTP framework.reply",
      "(I know Erlang well, but haven't used Gleam)The library the parent links to says this:> Not all Erlang/OTP functionality is included in this library. Some is not possible to represent in a type safe way, so it is not included.Does this mean in practice that you can use all parts of OTP, but you might lose type checking for the parts the library doesn't cover?reply",
      "No, it means that one specific package only offers bindings to certain parts. It\u2019s the documentation for one library, not the language.reply",
      "> Hi, I\u2019m the creator of Gleam!What's the state of Gleam's JSON parsing / serialization capabilities right now?I find it to be a lovely little language, but having to essentially write every type three times (once for the type definition, once for the serializer, once for the deserializer) isn't something I'm looking forward to.A functional language that can run both on the backend (Beam) and frontend (JS) lets one do a lot of cool stuff, like optimistic updates, server reconciliation, easy rollback on failure etc, but that requires making actions (and likely also states) easily serializable and deserializable.reply",
      "You can generate those conversions, most people do.But also, you shouldn\u2019t think of it as writing the same type twice! If you couple your external API and your internal data model you are greatly restricting your domain modelling cability. Even in languages where JSON serialisation works with reflection I would recommend having a distinct definition for the internal and external structure so you can have the optimal structure for each context, dodging the \u201clowest common decimator\u201d problem.reply",
      "I understand your point, and I agree with it in most contexts! However, for the specific use case where one assumes that the client and server are running the exact same code (and the client auto-refreshes if this isn't the case), and where serialization is only used for synchronizing between the two, decoupling the state from it's representation on the wire doesn't really make sense.reply",
      "Totally. This is where I would generate them.reply",

      "Isn't this kinda what MUDs are? I tried a few in the early days of the internet and even back then they were like much bigger and more dynamic versions of text adventures of the 80s. For me I bounced off the idea that I had to role-play with other humans - I thought it was far more interesting to chat with other humans about real-world topics - but if you are looking for a large, text-based role-play experience then it's probably worth trying out a few. There might even be some that can be soloed these days, there are so many.I think the challenge of trying to make an \"endless\" game using an LLM is the same challenge that all procgen games face - they are boring for people who are seeking a well-paced narrative. There are players who enjoy the mechanics of looting/crafting/trading/etc who will gladly play games where the story is incidental or emergent, but if you're specifically looking for something with a bit more narrative depth, I'm not sure procgen will ever work. Even if there is a system that tries to project coherent storylines onto the generated world, you still need the player to do things that fit into a storyline (and not break the world in such a way that it undermines the storyline!), otherwise the pacing will be off. But if the system forces the player into a storyline, then it breaks the illusion that the world was ever truly open. So you can't have it both ways - either there is a narrative arc that the player submits to, or the player is building their own narrative inside a sandbox.AAA games try to have it both ways, of course, but it's always pretty clear when you are walking through procgen locations and leafing through stacks of irrelevant lore vs when you are playing a bespoke storyline mission that actually progresses the state of the world.reply",

Oh more bottle caps again in a drawer but I can begin to tell what rooms will be essential to look in and which won't buy the middle of the game.

Or something where it halts for a given input after some number of steps unless something some counter example exists where it goes on forever.In the first, you can\u2019t really do anything but just keep watching it not halt but it isn\u2019t telling you anything about the infinity to go.  (Say a program that spits out twin primes, we expect an infinite number but we don\u2019t really know)And in the second case we\u2019d just have to keep trying larger and larger inputs making this just an extension of the first category if we wrote a program to do that for us.

In other words, the halting problem from blank tape of Cryptids is mathematically-hard.\nIf there exists a Cryptid with n states and m symbols, then BB(n, m) cannot be solved without solving this hard math problem.\nThe name Cryptid was proposed by Shawn Ligocki in an Oct 2023 blog post announcing the discovery of Bigfoot.\nThis is a list of notable Minimal Cryptids (Cryptids in a domain with no strictly smaller known Cryptid).

      "FTA: \u201cHeap allocations made by the function are erased as soon as the garbage collector decides they are no longer reachable\u201dI think that means this proposal adds a very specific form of finalisers to go.How is that implemented efficiently? I can think of doing something akin to NSAutoReleasePool (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsautor...), with all allocations inside a `secret.Do` block going into a separate section of the heap (like a new generation), and, on exit of the block, the runtime doing a GC cycle, collecting and clearing every now inaccessible object in that section of the heap.It can\u2019t do that, though, because the article also says:\u201cHeap allocations are only erased if  the program drops all references to them, and  then the garbage collector notices that those references are gone. The program controls the first part, but the second part depends on when the runtime decides to act\u201dand I think what I am thinking of will guarantee that the garbage collector will eagerly erase any heap allocations that can be freed.Also, the requirement \u201c the program drops all references to them\u201d means this is not a 100% free lunch. You can\u2019t simply wrap your code in a `secret.Do` and expect your code to be free of leaking secrets.reply",

      "I have to wonder if we need, say, a special \"secret data\" type (or modifier) that has the semantics of both crypto/subtle and runtime/secret. That is to say, comparison operators are always constant-time, functions holding the data zero it out immediately, GC immediately zeroes and deallocs secret heap allocations, etc.I mean, if you're worried about ensuring data gets zeroed out, you probably also don't want to leak it via side channels, either.reply",

You can check Enabled() if you need to know and intend to do something different but I assume most of the time you run the same function either way you'd just prefer to opt into secret mode if it's available.reply",
      "This is not what secret.Enabled() means. But it probably illustrates that the function needs to be renamed already. Here's what the doc comment says:  // Enabled reports whether Do appears anywhere on the call stack.\n\nIn other words, it is just a way of checking that you are indeed running inside the context of some secret.Do call; it doesn't guarantee that secret.Do is actually offering the protection you may desire.reply",

      "Why not just panic and make it obvious?reply",

After the function finishes, it immediately erases (zeroes out) the registers and stack it used. Heap allocations made by the function are erased as soon as the garbage collector decides they are no longer reachable.This helps make sure sensitive information doesn't stay in memory longer than needed, lowering the risk of attackers getting to it.The package is experimental and is mainly for developers of cryptographic libraries, not for application developers.Cryptographic protocols like WireGuard or TLS have a property called \"forward secrecy\". This means that even if an attacker gains access to long-term secrets (like a private key in TLS), they shouldn't be able to decrypt past communication sessions.

Part 2 is modelling how stable the iceberg is given the measured shape.

      "Nice move and nice write-up! There has been so much propaganda around serverless, so we need to hear more of these voices.I moved away from FreeBSD to Debian for hosting my things because the process/daemon management was too tricky. You seem to have figured out a good solution, but I wanted something simpler like PM2 for automatic process management/restarting/logs. Unfortunately PM2 has an issue [1] that makes it unworkable with FreeBSD. It would be so nice if FreeBSD had a smooth, more declarative way of managing processes.1.\nhttps://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/5718reply",
      "Thanks!> I moved away from FreeBSD to Debian for hosting my things because the process/daemon management was too tricky.It indeed is tricky. To be honest, I wasn't \"put off\" by it because I've been using BSDs and old-style Linux startup systems for almost 30 years now... but the lack of abstraction shows, and I don't think it's great.The daemon(8) wrapper is neat to integrate pre-existing servers into rc.d, but I do not fancy having to deal with that \"by hand\" nor to create a shell script to manage my own service (related from a few years ago: https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/rcd-libexec-etc.html) nor to have something entirely separate to manage log rotation.As much hate as systemd gets, I do think being declarative (and doing so in a DSL that's not a programming language) and having a true process \"supervisor\" is a better model. BUT, as I mentioned in this article, I also like the \"no churn\" of the BSDs because what I learned and refined over ~30 years is still similar to this day and that I won't be bitten by surprises.reply",
      "Even with daemon(8), PID files and the lack of process supervision might be my least favorite aspect of FreeBSD, an OS I like overall. Not long ago, I wanted to avoid running a custom service that way on a fresh FreeBSD server. After researching my options, I found an adequate solution in the daemontools family. I'd heard of daemontools but hadn't paid much attention to it.My service has been managed by runit and, most recently, nitro (https://github.com/leahneukirchen/nitro). Both have run as the service's user. They supervise the process and handle logging. I have found the design of daemontools and its derivatives runit and nitro elegant; it lives up to the reputation.reply",
      "Not GP, but I do prefer the very direct control you get with rcctl (OpenBSD), openrc (Alpine),... Systemd often feels like autoconf. It's needed when you really want the capabilities, otherwise the opaqueness and complexity feels very much cumbersome when you're dealing with a simple service.I do like the Unix way of having different components handling different tasks instead of having different things which are entangled with each other.
