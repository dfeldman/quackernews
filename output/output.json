      "I feel I need to report my experience from Denmark, Jutland.It started with white broad streaks, which most of all looked like fog, but then perhaps after 10 minutes or so, we saw colors of red, purple and green begin to emerge from the these streaks. Most astoundingly it all seemed to emanate from a fluctuating point in the middle of the sky. If you looked closely at this point  you could see it fall into itself, morphing and shifting continuously.We went around the house and we could purple streaks at the top and orange to red patches at the bottom of the sky.Colors observed:\nWhitish blue,  \nGreen,\nPurple,  \nRed,\nand OrangeAn absolutely a beautiful experience.",
      "Can you share a photo?",
      "I took one semi successful photo using my crappy beat-down a20e Samsung phone.It doesn't do what we saw justice at all.https://imgur.com/5mlD22W",
      "Wow!  Check out the view from the Jungfraujoch in Switzerland!   https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/live/webcams/#webcam-jungfrauj...",
      "Doesn\u2019t look like that in reality. If I take a photo on my phone here in the UK midlands I get pink and green in all directions with a 3 second exposure.However with just the naked eye it\u2019s like super high level clouds",
      "Yeah, camera sensors (depending on filtering) are far more sensitive to the dim light of the aurora than our eyes.  Still means you can get utterly amazing photography there already!  :)",
      "I was in Northern MN a couple years back when there was some decent aurora https://imgur.com/a/nBjdhZ9What the camera caught was really impressive! Even with just a couple seconds exposure on a phone.  But what the human eye saw was.... effectively a portion of the sky that was unusually bright and seemed to have some sort of movement. Like you stared at it and knew something was amiss, but nothing \"impressive\" to look at.",
      "A couple of years ago in the middle of Norway (not south, not north, in-between) me and a friend saw in the news that there would be aurora borealis, which is not common in that part of Norway.We were outside at like 2AM in the night that day trying to spot it but could see any hint of it for the life of us.Finally we used his phone and long exposure to see what it would pick up and on the captured photo we saw shades of green like aurora borealis.Quite fascinating, it was.",
      "For what it's worth... growing up in Troms\u00f8, we have auroras a few dozen times per winter usually.They were always strong enough to be easily seen, often quite dramatic. It really does look like that if you're far enough north.",
      "For sure. As mentioned though we were in the middle of Norway, not north.Well, actually the proper term for where we were at is East Norway. And I guess by official standards the middle of Norway is further north than where I consider the middle of Norway to be.To be very specific, we were in Gj\u00f8vik."

      "Will be interesting to see how this affects math research.  He has pumped unthinkable amounts of money into the field.  The only first-class flights I've taken in my life were to get to Simons-funded conferences at super fancy hotels.  (I found these conferences a bit ridiculous, but the luxury treatment did ensure that they could get together a lot of the biggest names in the field in one place.)Besides the conferences, there is the SCGP at Stony Brook, the Simons Center in Manhattan, whatever MSRI is called now, AMS-Simons travel grants, tons of money for the arXiv, the Magma license deal... and that's just the stuff that I've benefited from personally. I know there's more, Simons Collaboration grants and probably other things I've never heard of. He was very good to us all.We've always joked that Phds in geometry-adjacent fields have to have one of the highest average incomes of any degree, probably at least $1 million a year.  Simons making $3 billion, the rest of us making 90k apiece.",
      "Hopefully the Simons empire has enough people who will keep executing his vision and stave off bureaucratic rot.Making money is one thing, but circulating so much of it back through math and science is a great legacy.",
      "The thing is that he genuinely loved math. I don't think there's really anyone in his orbit who loves math as much. His family is his family and his colleagues love money.We'll see in the coming months and years whether he was able to create a structure that continues his legacy but usually the answer to that question is no.",
      "It's hard watching venerable institutions rot into \"just avoid administerial short term blame\"  death loops.  You have to have skin in the game, not just hire a temporary manager for it.",
      "His foundation also donates a lot to neuroscience research, particularly for Autism. I think there was a family reason for that, so probably at least some of his scientific philanthropy will continue for awhile. But yeah it's extremely hard to create a structure that would perpetuate without the remaining people at the top truly buying into and understanding the mission.",
      "I think it's doable. Institutions under top leadership can thrive long after its founders die. This is true of almost every Fortune 500 company. I am sure there is enough redundancy to continue the foundation's goal. Carnegie foundation or Ford foundation, or Apple computers after jobs died .",
      "I don't understand the relationship with Steve Jobs. Nobody's arguing that Renaissance, his investment fund, will do well without him.We're talking about the philanthropy that Simmons led in mathematics and science through his foundation.Now, whether this support will continue depends on the will of Jim as well as his family.",
      "sadly, the trend for these sorts of things is to sour after the original founder leaves...There is an esoteric concept that has some dynamics that explain this phenomenon somewhat. Not to get to into the weeds (the origins of this concept are esoteric religious ideas - I mean this secularly, as it relates to business entities) but the concept is an 'egregore'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore#:~:text=An%20egregore....I don't see it on the Wikipedia page, but the theory that explains the degradation of a companies original mission statement can be summarized as this: \"Within an organization(egregore) there exists three classes of individuals... the primary two of which are those that serve in the name of the egregore, and those that serve the egregore directly, the third (a smaller %) being those un-loyal to the current structure and would change the egregore to suit their needs. Of the main two: The dichotomy can be spilt along lines like developers/founders vs marketers/sales, where developers are interested in serving the mission statement and developing a good product, and marketers are interested in growth and survival, at the expense of everything else. So when the developers/founders leave, the vacuum that is created is filled either by those that would change the egregore, or corrupt the mission statement in the name of growth and profit.\"This is a simplistic model - with a fair bit of predictive and explanatory power. I have found it useful to describe that shift inside a corporation.",
      "Simons has been out of day-to-day management for quite some time. He was succeeded by co-CEOs who were then themselves succeeded, IIRC. (These are my recollections from reading The Man Who Solved the Market). Apparently his management style was always pretty hands off and they operated multiple successful quant strategies that were led by others. Their Medallion fund returned 22% after (huge) fees in 2022 according to the WSJ. [1] That's the employee only fund that has blown the doors off for 30+ years. They do have a few other funds that manage much more $ and manage external money that have never performed at Medallion's level. In other words, it seems like succession will not be a major risk for them in the near term.[1] https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-hedge-funds-are-top-perform...",
      "It would imply good processes for keeping out those that would run it to the ground in the name of (short term) profits... That makes me hopeful...But every succession is a risk. Every merger is a risk... ask Boeing."

I've seen claims that fine-tuning only adapt the \"forms\" but can't adding new knowledge, while some claim otherwise. I couldn't convince myself either way with my limited adhoc/anecdotal experiments.",

It\u2019s a sticky meme that makes no sense.Pretraining obviously adds knowledge to a model.  The difference between pretraining and fine-tuning is the number of tokens and learning rate.  That\u2019s it.",

      "Yeah... So looks like at least it's still an open question. I guess until we can definitively know how \"knowledge\" is collectively represented among the weights, it's hard to say either way. The other part of the question is how to evaluate the existence of \"knowledge\" in an LLM. TFA suggests a way, but still not 100% convinced that's THE way...",

I wish there was something similar for desktop applications.The nice thing about implementing this for the web is that the API you have to record data from (DOM events) is the same no matter what UI toolkit you use on top of it. But on desktop, the ecosystem is more fragmented and would require more ports and quirks to implement a widely compatible bug recorder.I'm not a fan of webdev, but this is an advantage it has over desktop development.",
      "Nice work, looks like you've got some big names using it too, congrats.I have some feedback on your homepage & messaging.Initially scrolling the home page I thought it was a tool for viewing customer bug sessions, similar to TrackJS or Sentry.Reading this post it became clear this is for product managers and/or team members to file bugs. The line \"Built for everyone\" on the home page threw me off.I think if you make the distinction that this is an internal tool for teams vs. an external tool for tracking customer issues it might help make this messaging clearer.I'm not sure of your plans (perhaps you also intend for external users to use it) this was just my first pass impression.I think this is a great tool. The structured format combined with the information provided by the extension are what make it valuable to me. The last minute feature is also nice as re-creating bugs can be a PITA.As a dev, I would ideally also want to be able to view stack traces with source maps, but having a consistent structured format combined with the extension data is enough of a value prop to start using it.",

I appreciate you flagging that, we should find better wording to make it more clear.And that's really nice to hear, thank you so much! Stack traces with source maps. I agree.

      "Fascinating mission. I don't understand how microlensing events resulting from primordial black holes can be differentiated even statistically, given that they \"cannot be formed by any known physical process\", but in any case it's exciting to discover there's so much more up of something up there than we knew. Even if they are \"just\" rogue planets.",
      "I really want primordial black holes to turn out to be the missing antimatter from the Big Bang, but I don\u2019t think that could ever be tested. And of course a mechanism for this would probably need new physics since antimatter interacts the same as normal matter wrt gravity.",
      "it sounds a lot like it now that i read this, large dispersed amounts of antimatter that apparently doesn't give off light yet has massive gravitational pull",
      "Antimatter has the same electrodynamic properties as matter.",
      "https://youtu.be/qy8MdewY_TY?si=NVZzWJSFXl4EATRKGood video on topic",
      "Primordial black holes are a fascinating topic. One of my favorite hypotheses is that \"planet nine,\" a large possibly 1-5 Earth mass planet suggested by some orbital models to exist beyond Neptune and Pluto in the far outer solar system, may be a primordial black hole.If such a thing existed it'd be a black hole about the size of a billiard ball and would be extremely hard to detect. It would not emit Hawking radiation (Hawking temperature still below the CMB), so the only thing it would emit would be when it encountered something and tore it apart. In that case you'd see X-rays, gamma rays, etc., but maybe only briefly. Only way to find it might be to model orbits accurately enough to predict its position and then look for gravitational lensing.If this companion object did exist it'd be a gigantic discovery of huge importance. It'd be within reach of probes, making it possible to study and even do experiments on to investigate things like quantum gravity. It could also be used in tight gravity assist flybys to accelerate probes to incredible velocities, maybe making interstellar probes a lot more practical. It'd be our very own way to yeet stuff to the stars, assuming these things could withstand insane g-forces (so probably not humans unfortunately).",
      "Assuming you don't go so close that tidal effects tear the probe apart, the g-forces should only be those imposed by the probe's thrusters firing during the assist.  When the thrusters aren't firing it's just in free-fall.",
      "I feel like if you were close enough for a gravity assist, wouldn't the tidal forces just tear the probe apart?",
      "The tidal forces would be no different than using jupiter for an assist.  You would still have the probe pass by at several thousand, several tens of thousands of kilometers.  A close-in gravity assist may look better on paper, but the practicalities and speeds of such a thing are risky.  One small error and the mission would be over quick, launched out at a radically incorrect trajectory.",
      "Not necessarily. If you replaced the sun with an equivalent mass black hole, none of the orbits of the planets would change."

I removed evil immediately afterwards as 5 years of vim taught me to hate modal editing with a passion.",
      "It really weirds me out how many people use a sprinkling of vim keybindings but don't use more. Like how many vim users don't know <C-[> (esc) or contextual completion like <C-x><C-p> (:help ins-completion). I see so many people use plugins for things that already exist in vim but people never discuss.One that bites me a lot is when a vim keybinding is implemented, has insert mode, and they don't also rebind <C-w>. Go from trying to delete a word (backwards) but end up losing a whole session. It's such muscle memory I sometimes do it on webpages, but maybe that one is a feature instead of a bug lol",
      "This is my biggest complaint with keybindings on Linux/Windows, that Ctrl means \u201cescape codes\u201d in terminal emulator applications and \u201cwindow/UI operations\u201d in every other application.By contrast, in macOS all the window/UI keybindings are typically Cmd (Cmd-W) which means that GUI applications attempting to layer on vi keybindings don\u2019t have to also audit all the Ctrl keybindings that might be doing something wildly different compared to what vi users expect.Cmd for UI and Ctrl for terminal just makes for such a nice default convention.",
      "Configurable windows managers on Linux let you code a \u201csuper\u201d key. I like the Window key, since it serves no other purpose, and never overlaps with default bindings on Linux.So the Cmd/Ctrl split on Mac maps nicely to the Win/Ctrl split on Linux.",
      "While I do this too I understand the above complaint. I think naturally linux should have more of a system similar to what OSX does. I mean I'm constantly switching between OSX and Linux machines but more and more recently I've been at at mac computer while inside a linux system and that is very seemless because it is the GUI that fucks shit up. But now there's so much momentum that I'm not sure they can go back. I think the only way to make this correction is for a big distro like Ubuntu/Pop/Manjaro/Endeavor to switch to a default with alt or super as they windowed operating key but have the option to switch back (should be implemented in the install process and made clear and easy to undo. But without making it the default it'll always stay the other way. (first introduction should be non-default)).",
      "Super is the \"Windows\" key (or the Command key), it's the \"mod key\" that can then be set to super or alt/meta or whatever.For the reasons you suggest (WMs often heavily using the super key), I would not want it to be used in the macOS way as I have a few dozen keybinds I'd lose or have to remap then. Stuff like focusing or moving windows or workspaces. Emacs can also make use of the super key, though I don't know if it has anything bound using it by default.The macOS approach is cool and makes some sense, but I wouldn't want it forced on me, and I'm kinda glad I didn't imprint on it.",
      "I agree\u2014 having switched back to Windows five years ago, this is one of the biggest things I miss about the Mac hardware. Having a separate key just avoids the whole drama around whether Ctrl-C is \"copy the thing\" or \"shut it all down\", and which of those functions is going to get remapped to Ctrl-Shift-C and all the fallout from that.",

      "I think Deno KV is a great tool with a nice API, it's great to see how it works. Really well designed.I used it a couple of times locally with Sqlite for CLI apps, if you want to do some data manipulation stuff with TS from the CLI and need a db, don't look further.I also used it in Production with FoundationDB on Deno Deploy.It does not replace your postgres/mysql database but a different beast entirely for many reasons. One is pricing. You pay per read and write.An issue I had is that it's hard to migrate from using KV with Deno Deploy. You can migrate to a local SQLite backed instance but will need to develop your own solutions on how you migrate and it will cost more the larger your database gets because you pay for reads.I do think it's great, but I would recommend using Deno Deploy only if your reads and writes produce value that offset the costs, else you can find yourself in the issue of needing to migrate.For example, use it for features you offer to authenticated users, but don't use it for things available in the open, else you open up yourself to high fees from DDOS.",

You could hit growing pains almost instantly.",

How is it bought out? Because Vercel pays an OSS developer to further develop NextAuth, and Guillermo also invested in Clerk? Someone using NextAuth means they're not using Clerk."

      "The detail that has stuck in my mind since the last time I read about this is:Thermodynamically speaking, if you transmit electricity from outside the Earth onto the Earth \u2013 even if you do it perfectly efficiently \u2013 you are, by definition, heating the planet.Based on that I concluded that it is superior to generate electricity with inputs that are already hitting the Earth\u2026 But I\u2019d be very interested to learn more about this.",
      "The same thing happens when we create heat on earth with nuclear energy, when >50% is directly used to heat the earth via waste heat, and the electrical part becomes >99% waste heat (some tiny fraction of energy is probably permanently converted to chemical bonds, etc.)However, this is completely dwarfed by the dynamics of flux in and out of the earth. I forget the exact order of magnitude but I think it's around 100TW, and of course about that amount needs to be rejected to space. The key dynamics that provide us balance are of course the exact and precise quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, albedo, etc.And of course, coal and natural gas are releasing stored heat energy too, but their contributions to changes in the atmosphere far exceed the contribution from direct heat energy on the surface of the earth.",
      "The flux is roughly (but more than) 100 petawatts.Human energy utilization is on the order of 100 terawatts.",
      "This is false, if your SBSP conversion efficiency on the ground is better than solar panels on the ground then you will add less energy to earth by collecting the power in space and transmitting it to the ground then by changing the reflective albedo of desert to a very nonreflective material like solar panels.",
      "You could put the solar panels between the sun and Earth so they only capture photon that would have otherwise hit Earth, if that really matters. This would even be nice because if we wanted to cool the planet down we could just redirect some rays.But I think using an appreciable amount of the power provided to Earth by the sun is still sci-fi stuff anyway, so we probably can\u2019t make an appreciable dent either way.Sagan put us at around Kardashev .7, it is a log scale shifted by a constant, apparently we\u2019re under .2%, of what hits the Earth, I guess.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale",
      "If you set the thing up in the L1 Lagrange point it will have the same day/night problem that traditional solar has.  You would need at least two, but probably realistically 3 different antenna farms to collect the power and the satellite would need to be able to track the beam across the surface of the Earth.  Most of the proposals I've seen have the array in geosynchronous orbit so it can easily remain pointed at a fixed spot on the Earth.",
      "You could also beam power from L1 to geosynchronous orbit and then to a single ground station.  It really depends on how efficiently you can beam power, but hitting Type 1 on the Kardashev scale hits limitations based on radiative cooling into space vs incoming energy.However, it makes sense to have hundreds of ground stations simply to minimize transmission losses on the ground.  And presumably utilizing ground stations 24/7 is vastly less critical than maximizing the return on space based infrastructure.",
      "The Earth is in radiative balance with space on all but very short timescales. The extra heat, even if it were enough to matter, dissipates quickly.",
      "Not all that energy will end as heat. And the surface that it may cover won't be significant compared with the Earth one. And if it is, it may shadow enough surface to actually cool down Earth.In any case, it won't be worse than releasing a good amount of the captured solar energy in chemical form for millions of years in around a century.",
      "I think the more important facet is the output stage. Almost all energy consumed gets converted to heat, with only a small portion doing usable work. Unless there's a massive improvement in the electrical foundations of compute, we will be producing large amounts of heat no matter where the energy is sourced from."

Therefore, of course, you want to grab the latter one.Whether it's actually good until February 2025 is just someone's opinion.Furthermore, if you know that X is a month older than Y, then you know something else: X is at least a month old, today. If you buy the January 2025 jar of peanut butter, you're getting something that was already around for a month when the February 2025 jar was just made, assuming they keep the best before offset the same between runs. And then add the time it took for the jars to arrive to that store shelf.I would much rather see \"date packaged\" on every product.For instance, roasted coffee beans are not very good past only two or three weeks, but not in a way that you would get sick from consuming them. (You can keep them in the freezer to keep the flavor a bit longer.) The exact roast date is important, which they often don't want you to know, substituting a fictitious best before date which includes a generous margin regarding how long it's going to sit in warehouses and on store shelves.",

Only in a couple highly specific cases do you need to be conservative about eating old food (meat products and cooked rice are the two I worry most about, and I don't eat much meat so it's really just the latter). If it smells bad or tastes bad: don't eat it. If you can cut off or pull off the parts that are bad, but the rest is good: you're fine. Humans can (and have) survive and thrive on a shocking variety of food items and qualities, this level of omnivory is one of our biggest evolutionary advantages.

      "Superposition does not fork the world. This common misconception arises due to confusion between superposition and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, but it\u2019s easy to see that the two are only superficially similar. States in a superposition still interfere\u2014that's the essence of the double-slit experiment.In contrast, when arguing that the timeline 'splits' due to measurements, the resulting universes do not interact at all and remain completely unaware of each other\u2014they can never even know if the others exist.If quantum computers truly 'forked' the world, they would be equivalent to non-deterministic Turing machines (capable of solving NP-complete problems in polynomial time), but quantum computing experts agree that they can still be modeled as deterministic Turing machines.It's better to think of quantum computers as a type of analog computer, capable of solving certain problems that fit their model well, but not generally more powerful. It\u2019s like an Intel CPU having SIMD or AVX instructions that allow it to perform certain operations faster, but these don't fundamentally change its capabilities. The no-free-lunch theorem applies.",
      "Correct - superposition doesn't fork the world - measurement does. And correct, you can't communicate with the other universe after the split has happened [1]. I'm glad you mentioned that quantum computers can't solve NP-complete problems - my next blog post was going to be about why. Here's an overview of what I plan on saying:A typical quantum algorithm like Shor's works by sending every possible input through a gate, and so you get every possible output out in a superposition. If you were to just measure that, you'd get a random result - so instead, you need to somehow interfere the output to get the actual result. You do this by taking advantage of the fact that the superposition is a periodic function and the amplitude repeats. This is literally the core assumption of the algorithm.(a common way of doing this using the QFT).Every quantum algorithm requires some kind of structure in the output like this. Deustch's algo, dumb ones like Simon's algo, etc. NP-Complete problems have no structure to them, so even if you build a gate that creates the superposition you want, it's not possible to destructively interfere it to get an answer (I don't know how to prove that there's no structure to NP-Complete outputs - it just feels trivial, since they're only solvable in exponential time, so there must be an exponential amount of \"structure\" there).---[1] The only way to communicate with the other universe would be to try to use quantum mechanics with something like an entangled pair. But no information can be communicated through an entangled pair if all you just have 1 of the 2 particles! Measurement collapses a state nonlocally, and if you could somehow measure one particle and change the probability distribution of the other, you'd be communicating faster than light. The measurement genuinely changes the state and the amplitudes, but not in a way that the other person can detect. It's really interesting and leads to stuff like teleportation.",

The field is screwed.Here\u2019s a quick explanation from me- \nThe state |x> means you have some qubits that represent the number x.

Maybe you measure 15, that means the state is now |1,1,0,1>, you just deleted all the terms that aren\u2019t 15.This is a full pic of Shor\u2019s algorithm \nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/ZE5rDxHScm4LUqms6If you look at the pic, main idea is the first layer of H\u2019s creates the state sum_x=0\u20262^n-1 |x, 0>, then gate U turns that state into sum_x |x, f(x)>, then the measurements measure which f(x) you have, deleting all the terms that don\u2019t have that f(x) in them, so for example if you measure that f(x) is 13, the state is now |0, 13> + |15, 13> + |30, 13> + |45, 13> + \u2026\nThis is the periodic state. Now that we have it we can just apply a gate that takes the QFT (finds the frequency, which here turns the state into roughly |15, 13>), and then measures it, giving the answer period=15.",
      "Since quantum computers can stimulate classical computers, presumably they can solve NP-complete problems, since classical computers, by definition, can. Perhaps you mean that they can\u2019t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time, but we don\u2019t even know that of classical computers, so you would presumably have shown that P\u2260NP, which would be fairly impressive.",
      "So you're nitpicking it for being too strong of a statement and too weak of a statement at the same time?How about this, they can't do the thing NP stands for.  They can't run a generic polynomial-time algorithm in a nondeterministically-branching way, and then pick the winner.",
      "I considered multiple readings of the claim. Obviously different readings may differ in strength. I do not exclude a reading that is neither too strong nor too weak; the comment is an invitation to give one, which you appear to have taken up.I do not see the distinction between what you have written in the second paragraph and the claim that P\u2260NP."

      "Wow that is crazy that it is between chance and 1/phi.In the linked MSE post, it has now been proved that the probability that the largest root is real is at least 6.2%And! at least 1/10th of 1/phi. Hahaha! :)I think the link of phi with number theory is natural in the sense that the primes are not random (as is commonly mistaken) but arise recursively from prior primes: they are exactly the 'gaps' not hit by multiples of prior primes, so there's a kind of 'natural growth' pattern that we would expect to reflect some manner of e and phiIt's a very fundamental pattern of magnitude. Truth beauty et all",
      "You get e from the primes by averaging the set size of only growing gaps (2,3,5)(7,11)(13,17)... or only non-shrinking gaps (2,3,5,7,11)(13,17)(19,23,29)...Not a property of primes per se, just a property of growth. It works better with a set of randoms.",
      "I thinking that works for primes because primes are approximately randomly distributed.But primes are more directly \"e\" if you look at \u03c0(N), the count of primes less than N. That is ~n/ ln(n)https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function",
      "Beautiful! Phi always seems to show up when there is crowding.",
      "Thanks! Let's collab. We should start a \"primes investigation\" github repo!!!! :)",
      "I love number theory in the context of waves. Here\u2019s an example:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10751",
      "Thanks. When you mention waves I'm wondering how we can leverage FFT to make a function of the next prime? But it has to include all primes, I guess? Or is this Reimann, already??",
      "Yes, high-level descriptions of the RH are often vague about the connection between the zeta function and the prime numbers, but the short version is that, for every point on on the complex plane, there is an associated real-valued \"Riemann harmonic function\"; if you sum up the Riemann harmonic functions of the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function, you get the exact prime-counting step function, and this function is much more predictable if the RH is true.",
      "Two questions that immediately jump at me are:1. What is random? They seem to have run numerical experiments, which suggests they used (something equivalent to) uniform integer coefficients from a bounded set. And that could affect findings a lot!2. Did they look at odd degrees (which always guarantees a real root), even or both?Not trying to knock this fun post.",
      "As stated in the definition, the distribution is that of independent uniform coefficients in (-1,1)."
