      "Fun fact: this is one of the few situations in the US where a prosecutor could claim that this is criminal speech  (though I hope and trust they would not, and if it did it would get thrown out by any court respecting the First Amendment).Not a civil issue, like libel or fraud, but the sort of talk that can get a policeman to come and drag you off to jail. If you've ever wondered why DRM is so roundly hated by engineers of a certain age, it's because not only it dumb makework that they are required to implement, not only is it extremely irritating to discover it interfering with your own computer, but if you do effectively point out how dumb, irritating, and eminently circumventable it is, they made it against the law to even tell anyone.https://www.eff.org/press/releases/licensing-scheme-fair-use...reply",

      "I fear the conceptual churn we're going to endure in the coming years will rival frontend dev.Across ChatGPT and Claude we now have tools, functions, skills, agents, subagents, commands, and apps, and there's a metastasizing complex of vibe frameworks feeding on this mess.reply",
      "You forgot mcp-everything!Yes, it's a mess, and there will be a lot of churn, you're not wrong, but there are foundational concepts underneath it all that you can learn and then it's easy to fit insert-new-feature into your mental model. (Or you can just ignore the new features, and roll your own tools. Some people here do that with a lot of success.)The foundational mental model to get the hang of is really just:* An LLM* ...called in a loop* ...maintaining a history of stuff it's done in the session (the \"context\")* ...with access to tool calls to do things. Like, read files, write files, call bash, etc.Some people call this \"the agentic loop.\" Call it what you want, you can write it in 100 lines of Python. I encourage every programmer I talk to who is remotely curious about LLMs to try that. It is a lightbulb moment.Once you've written your own basic agent, if a new tool comes along, you can easily demystify it by thinking about how you'd implement it yourself. For example, Claude Skills are really just:1) Skills are just a bunch of files with instructions for the LLM in them.2) Search for the available \"skills\" on startup and put all the short descriptions into the context so the LLM knows about them.3) Also tell the LLM how to \"use\" a skill. Claude just uses the `bash` tool for that.4) When Claude wants to use a skill, it uses the \"call bash\" tool to read in the skill files, then does the thing described in them.and that's more or less it, glossing over a lot of things that are important but not foundational like ensuring granular tool permissions, etc.reply",
      "Pretty true, and definitely a good exercise. But if we're going to actual use these things in practice, you need more. Things like prompt caching, capabilities/constraints, etc. It's pretty dangerous to let an agent go hog wild in an unprotected environment.reply",
      "Oh sure! And if I was talking someone through building a barebones agent, I'd definitely tag on a warning along the lines of \"but don't actually use this without XYZ!\" That said, you can add prompt caching by just setting a couple of parameters in the api calls to the LLM. I agree constraints is a much more complex topic, although even in my 100-line example I am able to fit in a user approval step before file write or bash actions.reply",
      "when you say prompt caching, does it mean cache the thing you send to the llm or the thing you get back?sounds like prompt is what you send, and caching is important here because what you send is derived from previous responses from llm calls earlier?sorry to sound dense, I struggle to understand where and how in the mental model the non-determinism of a response is dealt with. is it  just that it's all cached?reply",
      "Not dense to ask questions! There are two separate concepts in play:1) Maintaining the state of the \"conversation\" history with the LLM. LLMs are stateless, so you have to store the entire series of interactions on the client side in your agent (every user prompt, every LLM response, every tool call, every tool call result). You then send the entire previous conversation history to the LLM every time you call it, so it can \"see\" what has already happened. In a basic agent, it's essentially just a big list of strings, and you pass it into the LLM api on every LLM call.2) \"Prompt caching\", which is a clever optimization in the LLM infrastructure to take advantage of the fact that most LLM interactions involve processing a lot of unchanging past conversation history, plus a little bit of new text at the end. Understanding it requires understanding the internals of LLM transformer architecture, but the essence of it is that you can save a lot of GPU compute time by caching previous result states that then become intermediate states for the next LLM call. You cache on the entire history: the base prompt, the user's messages, the LLM's responses, the LLM's tool calls, everything. As a user of an LLM api, you don't have to worry about how any of it works under the hood, you just have to enable it. The reason to turn it on is it dramatically increases response time and reduces cost.Hope that clarifies!reply",
      "Very helpful. It helps me better understand the specifics behind each call and response, the internal units and whether those units are sent and received \"live\" from the LLM or come from a traditional db or cache store.I'm personally just curious how far, clever, insightful, any given product is \"on top of\" the foundation models. I'm not in it deep enough to make claims one way or the other.So this shines a little more light, thanks!reply",
      "Why wouldn't you turn on prompt caching? There must be a reason why it's a toggle rather than just being on for everything.reply",
      "Writing to the cache is more expensive than a request with caching disabled. So it only makes economic sense to do it when you know you're going to use the cached results. See https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-cac...reply",

      "I agree with you, I consistently find Gemini 2.5 Pro better than Claude and GPT-5 for the following cases:* Creative writing: Gemini is the unmatched winner here by a huge margin. I would personally go so far as to say Gemini 2.5 Pro is the only borderline kinda-sorta usable model for creative writing if you squint your eyes. I use it to criticize my creative writing (poetry, short stories) and no other model understands nuances as much as Gemini. Of course, all models are still pretty much terrible at this, especially in writing poetry.* Complex reasoning (e.g. undergrad/grad level math): Gemini is the best here imho by a tiny margin. Claude Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5 are pretty close but imho Gemini 2.5 writes more predictably correct answers. My bias is algebra stuff, I usually ask things about commutative algebra, linear algebra, category theory, group theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology etc.On the other hand Gemini is significantly worse than Claude and GPT-5 when it comes to agentic behavior, such as searching a huge codebase to answer an open ended question and write a refactor. It seems like its tool calling behavior is buggy and doesn't work consistently in Copilot/Cursor.Overall, I still think Gemini 2.5 Pro is the smartest overall model, but of course you need to use different models for different tasks.reply",
      "The best model for creative writing is still Deepseek because I can tune temperature to the edge of gibberish for better raw material as that gives me bizarre words.

The best writing is when a single token is so unexpected, it changes the entire sentence. top_p artificially caps that level of surprise, which is great for a deterministic business process but bad for creative writing.top_p feels like Noam Chomsky's strategy to \"strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum\".reply",

      "I don't have much to say about this post other than to vigorously agree!As an engineer who's full-stack and has frequently ended up doing product management, I think the main value I provide organizations is the ability to think holistically, from a product's core abstractions (the literal database schema), to how those are surfaced and interacted with by users, to how those are talked about by sales or marketing.Clear and consistent thinking across these dimensions is what makes some products \"mysteriously\" outperform others in the long run.reply",
      "It's one of the core ideas of Domain-Driven Design. In the early stage of the process, engineers should work closely with stakeholders to align on the set of terms (primitives as another commenter has put it), define them and put them in neat little contextual boxes.If you get this part right, then everything else becomes and implementation effort. You're no longer fighting the system, you flow with it. Ideas becomes easier to brainstorm and the cost of changes is immediately visible.reply",
      "There's a term for this - inventing a new primitive. A primitive is a foundational abstraction that reframes how people understand and operate within a domain.A primitive lets you create a shared language and ritual (\"tweet\"), compound advantages with every feature built on top, and lock in switching costs without ever saying the quiet part out loud.The article is right that nearly every breakout startup manages to land a new one.reply",
      "I was working for a company recently and we were exploring how to model what a minor can do with their guardian managed account.I did initially look at RBAC frameworks but since it was too complex for a small greenfield project I went with  one or more accounts linked to a user's profile with a RBAC junction table linking account and profile ID in a relational database.The junction table was the secret sauce, it allows you to stuff the RBAC permissions into its rows.I could get very far with this model. For example it allows for example who can pay for features(guardian not minor). Have multiple people manage a minor. Validate permissions for a logged in account.reply",

I guess you'd say \"domain model\" in product-speak, but to my engineering brain it doesn't evoke the cascading consequences of the model for the rest of the system. It's a rare product manager who treats the domain model as a consequential design product and a potential site of innovation.reply",

There's not a lot of code, but it was hard to reason about the data model, what I wanted the API to look like, and what I wanted actually rendered on the other side.I was proud after getting it working, but when I had to run dozens of files through it, it was horribly slow. I don't tend to write a lot of hot code, so I was excited by the fact I had to profile it and make it efficient.I decided that I should rewrite the system, as my mental model had improved and the code was doing a lot more than it should be doing for no reason.

      "The author concludes that \"I should make sure I sweated blood working on a strength, [and] do more of what comes naturally.\" Something I found was that sometimes the things I have the most passion and interest for are _not_ the things that are strengths. But they have become strengths. Today, I would consider myself to be an OS and systems programmer person. It was abjectly _not_ something that came to me naturally. To understand assembly language, C, and other things, and gain any sort of a proper grasp on, it took years. Sometimes, I tell people how long it took me and how much I struggled, and they are bewildered that I found these subjects so difficult. But I did.However, my motivating factor was my interest in the subject, not my innate strength in it, and that has pushed me to study it and become strong enough that I can (hopefully, I'm still in college!) succeed in that space.There are subjects where I could probably succeed if I tried harder and effusively sweated blood (probably pure math related). Pure math is one of those things I just suck at. But the difference is that I don't find it personally interesting, and so the burden of learning and building talent feels infinitely more overwhelming.Sometimes I wonder if interest influences not just my motivation, but my capacity for learning and talent. Sometimes I also wonder if my \"lack of innate talent\" is that actually \"I generally learn more slowly.\" But maybe learning more slowly helps me learn things more deeply as well. Who knows.* As a side note, the quote I was told is \"if you want to be known as a dog killer, you should kill dogs.\"reply",
      "Well, the absolutely best-case scenarios is when you both have an innate talent for something and deep interest/obsession about it; I think that the article encourages you to find exactly that and then focus on it, because once you combine innate talent + obsession, you do have unfair advantage over the othersreply",
      "I also think it's not super easy to evaluate whether you have an innate talent for something. The example of Ramanujan reading math textbooks when he was twelve is definitely an exceptional case, but I also think it's not clear to a lot of twelve year olds that such deep resources in a subject even exist. I was lucky that my county's library system had a literal treasure trove of computer science related books that I could check out as a tween and teen, so I was exposed to a subject before most people were.If your parents present you with your first computer when you're five years old, and it drops you to a bash prompt, and that's all you have, then you'll probably know considerably more than everyone else just from that being your only choice for a computing environment.So sometimes it's hard to quantify whether or not being more successful and growing faster is about the luck of exposure. There are times when I have switched textbooks for learning something or changed my learning style and suddenly catapaulted myself to having the highest scores in classes or understanding a topic infinitely better. People said assembly was easy for them, but maybe spending a year aimlessly typing \"si\" into GDB was not the most effective way to learn assembly.But having access to all these resources for exposure allows people to develop their interests and find their talents. It's just hard to say sometimes if that's innate talent and aptitude or just interest and being exposed before everyone else.reply",
      "I would partially agree. Speaking from experience, I can say that if you're naturally good at something, you can learn it pretty well even if resources are of poor quality. Obviously it makes all the difference if they're good, but you get it easily in any casereply",
      ">Sometimes I wonder if interest influences not just my motivation, but my capacity for learning and talent.It does. Anything you have an interest in, you will spend more time thinking about in general, be more focused while learning the relevant bits, and will breed a willingness to learn something related, but not specific to what you need.I'm senior technical in my dept and have had a lifelong interest in tech, how it works, why it works, etc. and in my case, my interest definitely influenced my ability to handle work, broad skillset, practical application and more.YMMV, but imo, your statement is true.GL!reply",

      "fwiw i think u hit the nail closer on the head.especially the example of the indian boy who borrowed and worked through math textbooks of local college students made it pretty clear to me that the difference between him and the poor kids in the US was the inherent drive he seemed to have in this anecdote.Same as for when the author described feeling to be deserving of praise for the work put in to get a C in math. He would not be satisfied with a C if he had an inherent drive to do math, hell he wouldn\u2019t have gotten that C if he had and if he did he wouldn\u2019t have felt deserving of applause since the work he put in would have felt like playing almost.reply",
      "I think it has to do with the Brain\u2019s favorite sources of dopamine. If you steer clear of the hedonistic approaches and focus on finding constructive ways to get your dopamine, those constructive ways may give you a living you enjoy. Physics, math, trading, coding, writing are all self-feedback fields you can iterate on in your own to get as good as you  want to be.

      "This reminds me of Oliver Burkeman's insight in \"Meditations for Mortals\" that we can only control quantity, not quality. He suggests we focus on what's within our control: showing up consistently and doing the work, rather than obsessing over outcomes. Another piece of his advice is to choose pursuits where you have a natural aptitude. Otherwise, there's too much friction. People enjoy being competent.Haruki Murakami describes a similar discovery in his memoir \"Novelist as a Vocation.\" He didn't set out knowing he had talent for writing, he discovered it through consistent practice. Only by writing his first novel did he realize he might have aptitude for it. Talent wasn't something he was born knowing about, but something he uncovered through action.reply"

      "Here's a use case that seems more science fictional to me (as the parent of a 2yo) than warp drive: a robot that can gently restrain an uncooperative human baby while changing its diaper, with everything that entails: identifying and eliminating all traces of waste from all crevices, applying diaper cream as necessary, unfolding and positioning the new diaper correctly and quickly, always using enough but never too much force... not to mention the nightmare of providing any guarantees about safety at mass-market scale. Even one maimed baby, or even just a baby some robot neglects to prevent from falling off the changing table, is game over for that line of robots.Is there any research program that could claim to tackle this? It's so far beyond folding laundry and doing dishes, which are already quite difficult.I wouldn't bet my life on this tech _never_ materializing, but I would mistrust anyone who claimed it was feasible with today's tech.

This is potentially easier than reliably shooting guns at people.That machine will look like a bean bag couch in rough shape of a giant human hand, with few of cooperative work robotic arms. The couch part hugs and secures all limbs of the baby to into the party escort submission position, then the cobots move in to find the disassembly markers on the diaper to tear it open to remove it. Then a showerhead, then a hair dryer, then baby powder sprayer can be brought out and ran to clean any residues and take care of rashes. Finally, the new diaper can be brought in, baby wrapped, and the double sided tapes on it lightly pressed on to secure it.The entire machine would probably cost less than 10 million USD per unit if mass produced at reasonable scales, and most technological elements needed in such machines would be readily available.reply",

That's normally not possible because a human hand isn't big enough and grippy enough to hold them that way, and that allows the baby to slip out or wiggle around. But if you could, and if the I-shaped types of diapers are tolerated, then the problem reduces into the matter of washing the bottom floating in space and wrapping them with the diapers. Legs can probably be kept out of the way by some cushions.reply",

So the YouTube on TV frontend (not YouTube TV the service) has to only use APIs they shipped like 10 years ago.And because it takes so long for an old Cobalt version to go out of support, they don't invest in implementing new features because they wouldn't be usable anytime soon. 10 years ago I was in a meeting with them where they said they couldn't implement something because they wouldn't be able to use it for 5 years...

Any reasonable web developer would expect this to be ignored by browsers not up to the task. This was not the case with older flavors of IE.

      "For the last five years I've been working on this problem!To solve it we need to be able to describe the structured content of a document without rendering it, and that means we need an embedding language for code documents.I hope this doesn't sound overly technical: I'm just borrowing ideas from web browsers. I think of my project as being the creation of a DOM for code documents. The DOM serves a similar function. A semantic HTML documents has meaning  independent of its rendered presentation and so it can be rendered many ways.CSTML is my novel embedding language for code. You could think of it like a safe way to hold or serialize an arbitrary parse tree. Like HTML a CSTML document has \"inner text\" which this case is the source text if the program the parser saw. E.g. a tiny document might be `<Boolean> 'true' </>`. The parser injects node tags into the source text, creating what is essentially the perfect data stream to feed a syntax highlighter. To do the highlighting you print the string content if the document and use the control tags to decide on color. This is actually already how we syntax highlight the output from our own CLI as it happens. We use our streaming parser technology to parse our log output into a CSTML tag stream (in real time) and then we just swap out open and close node tags for ANSI escape codes, print the strings, and send that stream to stdout.Here's a more complicated document generated from a real parse: https://gist.github.com/conartist6/412920886d52cb3f4fdcb90e3...reply"
