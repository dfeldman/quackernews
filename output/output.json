      "Feels like a mixed bag vs regression?eg -  GPT-5 beats GPT-4 on factual recall + reasoning (HeadQA, Medbullets, MedCalc).But then slips on structured queries (EHRSQL), fairness (RaceBias), evidence QA (PubMedQA).Hallucination resistance better but only modestly.Latency seems uneven (maybe more testing?) faster on long tasks, slower on short ones.reply",
      "GPT-5 feels like cost engineering. The model is incrementally better, but they are optimizing for least amount of compute. I am guessing investors love that.reply",
      "Definitely seems like GPT5 is a very incremental improvement. Not what you\u2019d expect if AGI were imminent.reply",

      "What you describe is a person selecting the best results, but if you can get better results one shot with that option enabled, it\u2019s worth testing and reporting results.reply",
      "I get that. But then if that option doesn't help, what I've seen is that the next followup is inevitably \"have you tried doing/prompting x instead of y\"reply",
      "Something I've experienced with multiple new model releases is plugging them into my app makes my app worse. Then I do a bunch of work on prompts and now my app is better than ever. And it's not like the prompts are just better and make the old model work better too - usually the new prompts make the old model worse or there isn't any change.So it makes sense to me that you should try until you get the results you want (or fail to do so). And it makes sense to ask people what they've tried. I haven't done the work yet to try this for gpt5 and am not that optimistic, but it is possible it will turn out this way again.reply",

This does not seem like a radical approach but instead seems to largely be how problem solving sort of works?For example, when I was a kid trying to push start my motorcycle, it wouldn\u2019t fire no matter what I did. Someone suggested a simple tweak, try a different gear. I did, and instantly the bike roared to life. What I was doing wasn\u2019t wrong, it just needed a slight adjustment to get the result I was after.reply"

      "My favorite Python \"crime\" is that a class that defines __rrshift__, instantiated and used as a right-hand-side, lets you have a pipe operator, regardless of the left-hand-side (as long as it doesn't define __rshift__).It's reasonably type-safe, and there's no need to \"close\" your chain - every outputted value as you write the chain can have a primitive type.x = Model.objects.all() >> by_pk >> call(dict.values) >> to_list >> get('name') >> _map(str.title) >> log_debug >> to_jsonIt shines in notebooks and live coding, where you might want to type stream-of-thought in the same order of operations that you want to take place. Need to log where something might be going wrong? Tee it like you're on a command line!Idiomatic? Absolutely not. Something to push to production? Not unless you like being stabbed with pitchforks. Actually useful for prototyping? 1000%.reply",
      "Could someone explain just what's so bad about this?My best guess is that it adds complexity and makes code harder to read in a goto-style way where you can't reason locally about local things, but it feels like the author has a much more negative view (\"crimes\", \"god no\", \"dark beating heart\", the elmo gif).reply",
      "Maybe I have too much of a \"strongly typed language\" view here, but I understood the utility of isinstance() as verifying that an object is, well, an instance of that class - so that subsequent code can safely interact with that object, call class-specific methods, rely on class-specific invariants, etc.This also makes life directly easier for me as a programmer, because I know in what code files I have to look to understand the behavior of that object.Even linters use it to that purpose, e.g. resolving call sites by looking at the last isinstance() statement to determine the type.__subclasshook__ puts this at risk by letting a class lie about its instances.As an example, consider this class:  class Everything(ABC):\n\n    @classmethod\n    def __subclasshook__(cls, C):\n      return True\n\n    def foo(self):\n      ...\n\nYou can now write code like this:  if isinstance(x, Everything):\n    x.foo()\n\nA linter would pass this code without warnings, because it assumes that the if block is only entered if x is in fact an instance of Everything and therefore has the foo() method.But what really happens is that the block is entered for any kind of object, and objects that don't happen to have a foo() method will throw an exception.reply",
      "You _can_ write pathological code like the Everything example, but I can see this feature being helpful if used responsibly.It essentially allows the user to check if a class implements an interface, without explicitly inheriting ABC or Protocol. It\u2019s up to the user to ensure the body of the case doesn\u2019t reference any methods or attributes not guaranteed by the subclass hook, but that\u2019s not necessarily bad, just less safe.All things have a place and time.reply",
      "I took the memes as largely for comedic effect, only?I do think there is a ton of indirection going on in the code that I would not immediately think to look for.  As the post stated, could be a good reason for this in some things.  But it would be the opposite of aiming for boring code, at that point.reply",
      "Side effectsreply",
      "TL;DR having a class that determines if some other class is a subclass of itself based off of arbitrary logic and then using that arbitrary logic to categorize other people's arbitrary classes at runtime is sociopathic.Some of these examples are similar in effect to what you might do in other languages, where you define an 'interface' and then you check to see if this class follows that interface. For example, you could define an interface DistancePoint which has the fields x and y and a distance() method, and then say \"If this object implements this interface, then go ahead and do X\".Other examples, though, are more along the lines of if you implemented an interface but instead of the interface constraints being 'this class has this method' the interface constraints are 'today is Tuesday'. That's an asinine concept, which is what makes this crimes and also hilarious.reply",
      "The real crime is the design of Python's pattern matching in the first place:    match status:\n        case 404:\n            return \"Not found\"\n\n    not_found = 404\n    match status:\n        case not_found:\n            return \"Not found\"\n\nEverywhere else in the language, you can give a constant a name without changing the code's behaviour. But in this case, the two snippets are very different: the first checks for equality (`status == 404`) and the second performs an assignment (`not_found = status`).https://x.com/brandon_rhodes/status/1360226108399099909reply",
      "That's destructuring, a feature not a bug. Same as it works in any functional language - and tremendously useful once you get the hang of itreply",
      "At least functional languages tend to have block scope, so the latter snippet introduces a new variable that shadows `not_found` instead of mutating it.reply"

    "first_paragraph": "Hillel WayneOne of my favorite little bits of python is __subclasshook__. Abstract Base Classes with __subclasshook__ can define what counts as a subclass of the ABC, even if the target doesn\u2019t know about the ABC. For example:You can do some weird stuff with this. Back in 2019 I used it to create non-monotonic types, where something counts as a NotIterable if it doesn\u2019t have the __iter__ method. There wasn\u2019t anything too diabolical you could do with this: nothing in Python really interacted with ABCs, limiting the damage you could do with production code.Then Python 3.10 added pattern matching.From the pattern matching tutorial:You can match on arrays, dictionaries, and custom objects. To support matching objects, Python uses isinstance(obj, class), which checksThat made me wonder if ABCs could \u201chijack\u201d a pattern match.

      "I wonder if there's a more intuitive way to define an elliptical arc given 2 endpoints. Dimension analysis shows we need 3 parameters. The SVG spec uses rx/ry/rotation, plus a couple booleans, but maybe there's a better parameterization without booleans? For example, it could be two coordinates of a control point - if the endpoints are A and B and the control point is C, the ellipse would be tangent to AC and BC - and an additional positive number for squishing the ellipse closer or farther from C, with values above 1 making the arc bubble outward. So it would occupy a natural spot between quadratic Bezier (with 2 parameters = 1 control point) and cubic Bezier (4 parameters = 2 control points).reply",

The keyword here is anonymized. Our digital lives are a constant trade-off between convenience and privacy, where every new account, every login, and every purchase adds another piece of our personal data to a vast, insecure, and interconnected web. This model has led to a plague of data breaches, identity theft, and online abuse. Changefly ID + Anonymized Identity & Age Verification offers a new way forward, one where we can prove who we are \u2014 without revealing who we are.Changefly ID addresses these issues with a novel approach: Anonymized Identity and Age Verification.

During the Wii U/3DS era nintendo had their own social network called miiverse, which was functionally identical to twitter but games could access and post messages to your miiverse account.  Wind Waker's integration was to let you scribble down a miiverse post onto a sheet of paper (via the Wii U's touchscreen) and Link would roll it up and shove it into a bottle then throw it out to sea.  It would then wash up on a beach in somebody else's game and you likewise would find other peoples' miiverse-in-a-bottle posts scattered all over the beaches of hyrule.reply",

We're just pretending that there's not.If someone came to you and said \"good news: I memorized the code of all the open source projects in this space, and can regurgitate it on command\", you would be smart to ban them from working on code at your company.But with \"AI\", we make up a bunch of rationalizations.  (\"I'm doing AI agentic generative AI workflow boilerplate 10x gettin it done AI did I say AI yet!\")And we pretend the person never said that they're just loosely laundering GPL and other code in a way that rightly would be existentially toxic to an IP-based company.reply",

You can host your software and only let customers interact with it remotely, like what Google (mostly) does.Of course, this is a very software-centric view.  You can't 'protect' eg books or music in this way.reply",
      "> Courts (at least in the US) have already ruled that use of ingested data for training is transformativeYes, the training of the model itself is (or should be) a transformative act so you can train a model on whatever you have legal access to view.However, that doesn't mean that the output of the model is automatically not infringing. If the model is prompted to create a copy of some copyrighted work, that is (or should be) still a violation.Just like memorizing a book isn't infringment but reproducing a book from memory is.reply",
      "This also matches my (not a lawyer) intuition, but have there been any legal precedents set in this direction yet?reply",
      "> Courts (at least in the US) have already ruled that use of ingested data for training is transformativeThis is far from settled law. Let's not mischaracterize it.Even so, an AI regurgitating proprietary code that's licensed in some other way is a very real risk.reply",
      "No more so than regurgitating an entire book. While it could technically be possible in the case of certain repos that are ubiquitous on the internet (and therefore overrepresented in training data to the point that they are \"regurgitated\" verbatim, in whole), it is extremely unlikely and would only occur after deliberate prompting. The NYT suit against Open AI shows (in discovery) that the NYT was only able to get partial results after deliberately prompting the model with portions of the text they were trying to force it to regurgitate.So. Yes, technically possible. But impossible by accident. Furthermore when you make this argument you reveal that you don't understand how these models work. They do not simply compress all the data they were trained on into a tiny storable version. They are effectively multiplication matrices that allow math to be done to predict the most likely next token (read: 2-3 Unicode characters) given some input.So the model does not \"contain\" code. It \"contains\" a way of doing calculations for predicting what text comes next.Finally, let's say that it is possible that the model does spit out not entire works, but a handful of lines of code that appear in some codebase.This does not constitute copyright infringement, as the lines in question a) represent a tiny portion of the whole work (and copyright only protecst against the reduplication of whole works or siginficant portions of the work), and B) there are a limited number of ways to accomplish a certain function and it is not only possible but inevitable that two devs working independently could arrive at the same implementation. Therefore using an identical implementation (which is what this case would be) of a part of a work is no more illegal than the use of a certain chord progression or melodic phrasing or drum rhythm. Courts have ruled about this thoroughly.reply"

      "Cave diver here, the article asserts how rare warm caves are but I think that is a very European mindset.The Mecca for cave diving is in the Yucat\u00e1n and surrounding areas and the caves there are exceptionally warm. The surface water can be chilly, coming in around 21c at one of the many cenotes (sinkholes, which are the entry points into the system) as rainwater fills them, but the further into the cave you penetrate you will eventually cross the halocline, at which point deeper = warmer ocean water. It\u2019s quite unintuitive but delightful to warm up after a 2+ hour dive. It\u2019s common for divers to go deeper, pull their wetsuit open a little to fill it with warmer water (24c+) and then rise up back to the planned depth.Cold cave diving is a very different experience and is usually found in Florida and Europe.

      "I kinda have the print edition of the Onion to thank for my career.Back in 2000, I had a \"100% travel\" tech consulting job. My favorite part of the week was finally getting back home to Chicago, grabbing a sub at a sandwich shop, and casually reading that week's edition cover to cover Saturday afternoon.One particular week, there was an ad for a local tech company (ThoughtWorks). I don't remember there being many tech job ads in the Onion at the time, so it stood out. I remember the ad copy being something like \"Does your life suck, or just your job? Work here instead.\" I immediately applied, interviewed, eventually got an offer, quit my other job, and started at ThoughtWorks. It was a massive upgrade.A few years later, I got to lead an internal dev team, and a spin-off project (Selenium) came out of that.Long story long: No Onion, no job at ThoughtWorks, no Selenium.Glad a new generation gets to enjoy leisurely reading fake news and seeing where it takes them in life.reply",
      "Selenium?That stack birthed almost an entire category of QA jobs.reply",
      "I feel like there's a funny Onion article version of this story :-Dreply",
      "TO is supposed to transport you away from life suck for 0.5-10 seconds. No warranties or refunds though.reply",
      "The way they will incorporate an absurd mix of expressive poetic technical and satirical writing in the same piece \u2014 to the point of belaboring it and wearing you down until you can\u2019t help but laugh is what I love. Compendiums off Amazon used books are about $8 I bought a stack a few years ago. \u201cWhat Makes Anna so Beautiful in the Moonlight?\u201d is a favorite for some reason (nerd explains beauty). Also the Onion Film Standard \u201cThe Onion Looks Back at E.T.\u201d Maybe this means Nathan Fielder will resurrect his short lived hardcopy newspaper \u201cThe Diarrhea Times\u201d too if there\u2019s an appetite!reply",
      "Game Informer is doing the same. I got the most recent copy and it was just a breath of fresh air. Articles written for their content, not to fill some quota or drive clicks. It was a month late (mostly stuff about SGF) but it didn\u2019t matter. I got to read what these passionate writers thought of the games and demos there and that was a great read, even if it wasn\u2019t \u201cnews\u201d.reply",
      "Really? I had a subscription to GI for a year or so because it came free with the GameCube I bought from Gamestop. I assumed it was just GS' in house ad rag. It's cool to know it still exists...Oh wait what's that, I just went to wikipedia and I was correct in my assessment but also now it's independent? Shit I might just subscribe for the sake of it.reply",
      "We would snag copies of The Onion at the University of Minnesota many many years ago. Always fun. I\u2019m glad they brought it back. It was always a great casual readreply",
      "Was one of my fav thing about being in Madison in the mid-90s. Especially the \u201cDrunk of the Week\u201d because you always checked to see if it was someone you knew.reply"

For every game, given the latency involved in previous networks, there is no way on the network games were deterministic.reply",

Though it's not a great analog since LLMs are not probabilistic in the same way quantum mechanics is.In any case, I appreciated the article because it talks through a shift from deterministic to probabilistic systems that I've been seeing in my work.reply",

Almost all of the implementationof LLMs is deterministic except the part that is randomized. Its output is used in the same way. Humans combine the two approaches as well. Even reality is a combination of quantum uncertainty at a low level and very deterministic physics everywhere else.> We're moving away from deterministic mechanicism, a world of perfect information and perfect knowledge, and walking into one made of emergent unknown behaviors, where instead of planning and engineering we observe and hypothesize.The hype machine always involves pseudo-scientific babble and this is a particularly cringey example. The idea that seems to be promoted, that AI will be god like and therein we'll find all truth and knowledge is beyond delusional.It a tool, like all other tools.

It's hard to accept that we invented a technology that we don't fully comprehend, and that exhibits behaviors that we didn't explicitly expect.Dismissal is a common reaction when witnessing AI\u2019s rate of progress. People struggle to reconcile their world model with what AI can now do, and how.This isn't new. Mainstream intuition and cultural impact always lag behind new technical capabilities. When we started building businesses on the Internet three decades ago, the skepticism was similar. Sending checks to strangers and giving away services for free felt absurd.

      "If you're not wedded to docker-compose, with podman you can instead use the podman kube support, which provides roughly docker-compose equivalent features using a subset of the Kubernetes pod deployment syntax.Additionally, podman has nice systemd integration for such kube services, you just need to write a short systemd config snippet and then you can manage the kube service just like any other systemd service.Altogether a very nice combination for deploying containerized services if you don't want to go the whole hog to something like Kubernetes.reply",
      "(I'm a big podman stan)Last I tried using the .kube files I ran into issues with specifying container networks (https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12965).This is sort of \"fixed\" by using a Quadlet \".kube\" but IMO that's a pretty weak solution and removes the \"here's your compose file, run it\" aspect.Recently (now that Deb13 is out with Podman 5) I have started transitioning to Podmans Quadlet files which have been quite smooth so far. As you say, its great to run things without all the overhead of kubernetes.reply",
      "(I'm a bigger podman stan)I agree about quadlets, amazing.Docker has one of the most severe cases of not-invented-here. All solutions require a combination of a new DSL, a new protocol, a new encryption scheme, a new daemon, or any combination there-of. People are sleeping on using buildah directly; which OP alluded to with Bakah (but fell short of just using it directly).Ever wish you could run multiple commands in a single layer? Buildah lets you do that. Ever wish you could loop or some other branching in a dockerfile? Buildah lets you do that. Why? Because they didn't invent something new, and so the equivalent of a dockerfile in buildah is just a script in whatever scripting language you want (probably sh, though).This will probably give you the general idea: https://www.mankier.com/1/buildah-fromI came across this when struggling and repeatedly failing to get multi-arch containers built in Circle CI a few gears ago. You don't have access to an arm64 docker context on their x86 machines, so you are forced to orchestrate that manually (unless your arm64 build is fast enough under qemu). Things begin to rapidly fall apart once you are off of the blessed Docker happy path because of their NIH obsession. That's when I discovered buildah and it made the whole thing a cinch.reply",
      "on the QEMU thing... the only time I tried to cross-build arm containers from an x86 server was using whatever servers Github Actions supports... the x86_64 build was pretty normal for the project, but the qemu/buildx/arm64 build was about the same speed as an 8mb Raspberry Pi 4 to build the same project... pretty disappointing.reply",

I can't find any reference to itYou're absolutely right to question that - I made an error. There is no ComposeService directive in systemd or Quadlet.It would be a nice best of both worlds...reply",
