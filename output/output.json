      "Ultimately, I don't think the most important challenge is in binary firmware blobs, but the software which people depend upon to run their lives. What does it matter if you can run a completely free software stack on your phone, if your bank software (or your required government ID, as is looking depressingly likely) requires you to run a Big Tech approved phone OS? Perhaps the FSF can't do much about that, but that is where I feel they could truly make the biggest difference for freedom for the average user.reply",
      "I think this is the right place to start.A free OS will empower developers to implement technical workarounds that could trick these apps into working there. If the OS is tightly controlled, we have no recourse.Even in the worst case scenario, we could use a cheap big-tech-approved phone for these applications (a glorified digital token) and use the free phone for everything else. When there's enough adoption and trust in the new phone, non-technical avenues are available to influence these organizations to accept the alternative.reply",
      "And I feel like it undermines any effort to make free, featureful applications if the hardware itself can't be trusted.reply",
      "It becomes much harder to force attestation on people if there's a significant user base that runs alternative operating systems.reply",
      "Do you really NEED to be forced to attest if you can make your phone look like any damn PC using a browser?reply",
      "These days browsers are becoming increasingly distrusted. My bank logs my browser out after 30 minutes inactivity and then to log back in I have to confirm the login on my phone.reply",
      "That\u2026 seems reasonable? My bank does that with their website and their mobile app. I was able to setup 2fa using a totp app, so i don\u2019t rely on sms for that partreply",
      "It is given the environment. But it does highlight the poor security of desktop browsers where they are only trusted to do anything when a phone app approves it. While the phone app is considered secure enough to just stay logged in perpetually without any external confirmation.To hack the banks app you have to find an exploit in iOS or Android which would allow you to read the other apps private storage, which is borderline impossible now. To hack the banks website you just have to buy some random browser extension and add malware to it, or break into someones NPM account and distribute it there, or any number of ways to run code on someone else's computer. Something very achievable by an individual.reply",

      "For a real world example of the challenges of harnessing LLMs, look at Apple. Over a year ago they had a big product launch focused on \"Apple Intelligence\" that was supposed to make heavy use of LLMs for agentic workflows. But all we've really gotten since then are a couple of minor tools for making emojis, summarizing notifications, and proof reading. And they even had to roll back the notification summaries for a while for being wildly \"out of control\". [1] And in this year's iPhone launch the AI marketing was toned down significantly.I think Apple execs genuinely underestimated how difficult it would be to get LLMs to perform up to Apple's typical standards of polish and control.[1] https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge93de21n0oreply",

      "I'm deaf.  Something close to standard Canadian English is my native language.  Most native English speakers claim my speech is unmarked but I think they're being polite; it's slightly marked as unusual and some with a good ear can easily tell it's because of hearing loss.Using the accent guesser, I have a Swedish accent.  Danish and Australian English follow as a close tie.It's not just the AI.  Non-native speakers of English often think I have a foreign accent, too.  Often they guess at English or Australian.  Like I must have been born there and moved here when I was younger, right?  I've also been asked if I was Scandinavian.Interestingly I've noticed that native speakers never make this mistake.  They sometimes recognize that I have a speech impediment but there's something about how I talk that is recognized with confidence as a native accent.  That leads me to the (probably obvious) inference that whatever it is that non-native speakers use to judge accent and competency, it is different from what native speakers use.  I'm guessing in my case, phrase-length tone contour.  (Which I can sort of hear, and presumably reproduce well, even if I have trouble with the consonants.)AI also really has trouble with transcribing my speech.  I noticed that as early as the '90s with early speech recognition software.  It was completely unusable.  Even now AI transcription has much more trouble with me than with most people.

      "I wish journalists would explore why the technical methods & information sharing that enable this surveillance are allowed to exist. Highlighting instances of abuse and the quasi-legal nature of the industry doesn\u2019t really get at the interesting part, which is _what motivates our leaders to allow surveillance in the first place_.I recently completed Barack Obama\u2019s A Promised Land (a partial account of his presidency), and he mentions in his book that although he wanted to reform mass surveillance, it looked a little different once he was actually responsible for people\u2019s safety. I often think about this when I drive past Flock cameras or walk into grocery stores; our leaders seem more enticed by the power of this technology than they are afraid of vague abuses happening in _not here_. It seems like no one sees a cost to just not addressing the issue.By analogy, I feel that reporting on the dangers of fire isn\u2019t really as effective as reporting on why we don\u2019t have arson laws and fire alarms and social norms that make our society more robust to abuse of a useful capability. People who like cooked food aren\u2019t going to engage with anti-fire positions if they just talk about people occasionally burning each other alive. We need to know more about what can be done to protect the average person from downsides of fire, as well as who is responsible for regulating fire and what their agenda for addressing it is. I\u2019d love to see an article identifying who is responsible for installing these Flock cameras in my area, why they did so, and how we can achieve the positive outcomes desired from them (e.g. find car thieves) without the negatives (profiling, stalking, tracking non-criminals, etc).reply",
      "> he mentions in his book that although he wanted to reform mass surveillance, it looked a little different once he was actually responsible for people\u2019s safety.This is a cowardly excuse. It's another way of saying that if you reform mass surveillance you'll be blamed for anything bad that subsequently happens, regardless of whether the mass surveillance would have prevented it. And bad things happen on a regular basis with or without mass surveillance, so then the politically risk-averse move is to not solve the problem you promised to solve and not expose yourself.Which is cowardly specifically because the candidate's original position was correct. You can solve crimes without mass surveillance, or prevent them by reducing poverty etc. If you do those things then the chances of something bad happening go down instead of up.And it will still not be zero -- it won't be zero no matter what you do -- but in that case you're only worried about adversarial pundits blaming you for things that weren't your fault, and adversarial pundits are going to do that regardless.reply",
      "Everyone thinks when they have power, they\u2019ll use it correctly, because they have (from their perspective) good intentions.An ideal government with total surveillance is the best case. You get the benefits of low crime without the drawback of corruption and ideology.\nThe problem is in practice:- Large institutions aren\u2019t good at exercising fine control: even if the leaders have truly good intentions, corrupt mid-level employees and inaccurate data lead to bad outcomes.- Good leaders seem to often pick bad successors, and unless they frequently pick better successors, someone will eventually pick a corrupt one.- Corrupt leaders seem to be good at ousting or sidelining good leaders, more than vice versa, perhaps because good leaders are less passionate about gaining and keeping power.Perhaps there are other reasons. Not just ideal governments, but even self-preserving governments don\u2019t tend to last.

Perhaps some people do but that's their problem, it shouldn't be mine. What politicians are is decision makers, not leaders.We don't have time to vote on every single law personally, so we appoint temporary assistants who do it for us, based on our preferences. That's how it should work.These assistants should work for us, not lead us. We should always have the power to override their decisions and to remove and replace them at any time. Of course, making this work in a practical manner, while satisfying constraints such as secrecy of votes, is difficult. I don't dispute that but we should be striving to find ways to get as close to this ideal as possible, not making politics into a career or treating it as a reality show.And most certainly, these assistants (\"leaders\" as you call them) should not be picking their successors without our consent.reply",

If we allow unlimited speech, that means that we're all subject to marketing and propaganda, and that's another thing that people are quite vulnerable to. Being convinced to vote via propaganda isn't really a great example of consent.

Think of \"mtools\" if you ever used them, but by reusing existing FAT code. Or making it trivial to create disk images from userspace without having to have special kernel primitives nor root access.And also, they allow taking a userspace application and packaging it with the minimum set of drivers required to run \"bare metal\".

      "We find similarly old structures across Eurasia, like the epigravettian mammoth bone huts. The late PPNA when KT/GT were seemingly built is when we find the first monumental, stone structures that we know of. It's entirely possible that ancient near east is where these kinds of things were first built. There's reasons I can go into why that's thought to be the case, but we can't rule out that there could be a streetlight effect happening. The ANE is where we expect to find this sort of early structure, and it's also one of the most heavily studied areas alongside North America and Europe. North Africa, particularly Tunisia where there's already a number of known epipaleolithic sites, is substantially less accessible for this kind of research.To directly answer your question though, the Tas Tepler sites survived because they were buried and the locations they're in are pretty bad places for people to live today. They're way up on hills around the urfa/harran plain where there's outcroppings of the stone used to build them, but also without water. People seemingly just carried water up the hills from cisterns farther down. The locations of those cisterns also suggest that there may be further sites we haven't found, because some of them don't correspond to anything we know of.reply",
      "To what extent is our understanding of this period limited by survivorship? Granite doesn't weather significantly, so we see lots of metalithic stone structures with ambiguous dating. The near east had significant changes in inland climates so we find ancient cities that were not built over there. Soft rock/mud Brick structures can survive in dry climates - so we see evidence of the oldest civilizations in deserts.Colonial New England barely exists outside of active preservation attempts.reply"

      "This is not realistically usefulreply",
      "Thanks for sharing!The heuristics you use are interesting, but this will likely only be a hindrance to lazy bot creators. TLS fingerprints can be spoofed relatively easily, and most bots rotate their IPs and signals to avoid detection. With ML tools becoming more accessible, it's only a matter of time until bots are able to mimic human traffic well enough, both on the protocol and application level. They probably exist already, even if the cost is prohibitively high for most attackers, but that will go down.Theoretically, deploying ML-based defenses is the only viable path forward, but even that will become infeasible. As the amount of internet traffic generated by bots surpasses the current ~50%, you can't realistically block half the internet.So, ultimately, I think allow lists are the only option if we want to have a usable internet for humans. We need a secure and user-friendly way to identify trusted clients, which, unfortunately, is ripe to be exploited by companies and governments. All proposed device attestation and identity services I've seen make me uneasy. This needs to be a standard built into the internet, based on modern open cryptography, and not controlled by a single company or government.I suppose it already exists with TLS client authentication, but that is highly impractical to deploy. Is there an ACME protocol for clients? ... Huh, Let's Encrypt did support issuing client certs, but they dropped it[1].[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44018400reply"

      "I like the license (FSL) chosen for the project, but it may need some explaining for others. Can you comment on decision for selecting the Functional Source License (Version 1.1, ALv2 Future License), and the intent from the Metorial team with it including any restrictions on potential commercial use of the platform (i.e. free-to-paid without notice)?For those who aren't aware of what FSL (https://fsl.software/) is: \"The Functional Source License (FSL) is a Fair Source license that converts to Apache 2.0 or MIT after two years. It is designed for SaaS companies that value both user freedom and developer sustainability. FSL provides everything a developer needs to use and learn from your software without harmful free-riding.\"reply",
      "Thanks for pointing that out. Ultimately, we wanted to strike a balance between being fair and open to the community, welcoming contributions, and ensuring that people can self-host without having to worry about licensing issues, while also ensuring that Metorial, as a company, can exist and work on OSS sustainably.

      "We\u2019ve just begun implementing Composio. Would love to reconsider if you help clarifying the main differences. From my perspective it looks like you have more robustness features to me as a developer and you\u2019re fully open source (not just the client) whereas Composio has more integrations. But would love your input to clarify.\nCongrats on the launch!reply",
      "Wen here, the co-founder. I actually spent a couple hours today to take the time to give you a comprehensive answer.1. As you said, Composio doesn\u2019t allow self-hosting and the source code isn\u2019t available. We want to follow PostHog\u2019s playbook in letting devs run everything on their own infrastructure and open sourcing all our MCP containers.2. A huge benefit of this approach is that we can let you fork any MCP server through our dashboard so that you can manage it yourself and make any adjustments you might need. We\u2019ve heard the importance of doing this repeatedly from our enterprise customers.3. I do believe that we offer more robustness features, like environment provisioning, deployment versioning, server pooling, in-depth logs of server startup, as well as a complete trace of the entire MCP session.4. On the integrations side, Composio does indeed have more integrations right now, but we already have around 600 MCP servers (all with multiple tools of course) of which many are being modified by us every day to make them better. Since we support open source contributions, the catalog also grows with the community. (Quick note that you can have private servers scoped to your org).5. I tried to benchmark our architecture vs Composio\u2019s in terms of speed. As we mentioned in the post above, one thing that we spent a lot of time on was optimizing how fast we can do serverless with MCP servers. However, since Composio has neither source available nor any technical documentation on how they handle their servers, I couldn\u2019t actually find any information on their architecture. One thing that they enforce as default is having a meta-tool layer with tools like composio_search_tools and composio_execute_tool. Assuming that this is a long living process, I still found that our implementation returned a list_tools response quicker (including the cold start time). If you factor in the time that it takes for them to find the right tools, their response took close to double the time. While we might explore a similar meta tool layer as an optional MCP server in the future, we do seem to on average have a better architecture in terms of speed, though the benchmarking was not entirely rigorous. (I am also unable to answer how they handle multiple users connecting to one MCP server with different OAuth configs because they don\u2019t share that information). I plan on making a more rigorous comparison in a blog post soon, also comparing to hosting on Vercel, Cloudflare, etc..Let me know if you have any follow up questions.If you want to talk more, please feel free to DM me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-rahme/) or X (https://x.com/wen_rahme).reply",
      "congrats on the launch!why do I need a specialized platform to deploy MCP instead of just hosting on existing PaaS (Vercel, Railway, Render)?also if you're not using VMs, how do you isolate per-user servers?reply",
      "Great questions!If you want to run your own remote servers (for your product/company) Railway or Render work great (Vercel is a bit more difficult since Lambdas are very expensive if you run them over long periods of time). Metorial targets developers who build their own AI agents and want to connect them to integrations. Plainly, we do a lot more then running MCP servers; we give you monitoring, observability, handle consumer-facing OAuth, and give you super nice SDKs to integrate MCP servers with your agent.Regarding the second question, Metorial has three execution modes depending on what the server supports: 1) Docker - this is the most basic one which any MCP server should support. We did some heavy optimizations to get those to start as fast as possible and our hibernation system supports stopping and resuming them while restoring the state. 2) Remote MCP - we connect to remote MCP servers for you, while still giving you the same features and ease-of-integration you get with any Metorial server (I could go more into detail on how our remote servers are better than standard ones). 3) Servers on our own lambda-based runtime. While not every MCP server supports this execution mode, it's what really sets us apart. The Lambdas only run for short intervals, while the connection is managed by our gateway. We already have about 100 lambda-based servers and working on getting more on to that execution model.There's a lot about our platform that I haven't included in this. Like our stateful MCP proxy, our security model, our scalable SOA, and how we transform OAuth into a single REST API calls for our users.Let me know if you have any additional questions, always happy to talk about MCP and software architecture.reply"
