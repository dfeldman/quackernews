Our data centers are the backbone of our operations, meticulously designed to support the scaling demands of compute and storage. A year ago, however, as the industry reached a critical inflection point due to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), we recognized that to lead in the generative AI space we\u2019d need to transform our fleet."

    "first_paragraph": "The bouba/kiki effect, or kiki/bouba effect, is a non-arbitrary mental association between certain speech sounds and certain visual shapes. Most narrowly, it is the tendency for people, when presented with the nonsense words bouba /\u02c8bu\u02d0b\u0259/ and kiki /\u02c8ki\u02d0ki\u02d0/, to associate bouba with a rounded shape and kiki with a spiky shape. Its discovery dates back to the 1920s, when psychologists documented experimental participants as connecting nonsense words to shapes in consistent ways. There is a strong general tendency towards the effect worldwide; it has been robustly confirmed across a majority of cultures and languages in which it has been researched,[1] for example including among English-speaking American university students, Tamil speakers in India, speakers of certain languages with no writing system, young children, infants, and (though to a much lesser degree) the congenitally blind.[1] It has also been shown to occur with familiar names. The effect was investigated using fMRI in 201"

Before SICP, the first CS course was almost always\nentirely filled with learning the details of some programming language.\nSICP is about standing back from the details to learn big-picture ways\nto think about the programming process.  It focused attention on the\ncentral idea of abstraction -- finding general patterns from specific\nproblems and building software tools that embody each pattern.  It made\nheavy use of the idea of functions as data, an idea that's hard to learn\ninitially, but immensely powerful once learned.
