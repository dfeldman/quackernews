      "Startup owner using AI with this need - needless to say, a real problem. I've considered DIYing an internal service for this - even if we went with you we'd probably have an intern do a quick and dirty copy, which I rarely advocate for if I can offload to SAAS. I'm sure you've put a fair bit of work into this that goes well beyond the human interaction loop, but that's really all we need. Your entry price is steep (I'm afraid to ask what an enterprise use-case looks like) and this isn't complicated to make. We don't need to productize or have all the bells and whistles - just human interaction occasionally. Any amount of competition would wipe out your pricing, so no I would not want to pay for this.\n \nreply",
      "thanks for the validation of the problem! totally open to feedback about the solution, and totally get that you only need something simple for now. I want to point out that we do have a pay-as-you-go tier which is $20 for 200 operations, and have a handful of indie devs finding this useful for back-office style automations.ALSO - something I think about a lot - if a all/most of the HumanLayer SaaS backend was open source, would that change your thinking?\n \nreply",
      "My gut feeling is with where we're headed we'll clear that 200 pretty quickly in production cases, so we'd be interested in bit higher volume. Our dev efforts would probably clear that 200/mo. If the flow/backend was open-source that'd be a total game changer for us as I see it as an integral part of our product.edit: I want to add here that while ycomb companies like yourself may have VC backing, a lot of us don't and do consider 500+/mo. base price on a service that is operations-limited to be a lot. You need to decide who your target audience is, I may not be in that audience for your SAAS pricing. This seems like a service that a lot of people need, but it also stands out to me as a service that will be copied at an extravagantly lower price. We have truly entered software as a commodity when I, a non-AI engineer, can whip up something like this in a week using serverless infra and $0.0001/1k tokens with gpt-o mini.\n \nreply",
      "that makes sense - and have wondered a lot even more generally about the price of software and what makes a hard problem hard. Like Amjad from Replit said on a podcast recently \"can anyone build 'the next salesforce' in a world where anyone can build their own salesforce with coding agents and serverless infra\"I think in building this some of the things that folks decided they don't want to deal with is like, the state machine for escalations/routing/timeouts, and infrastructure to catch inbound emails and turn them into webhooks, or stitch a single agent's context window with multiple open slack threads, but you're right, that can all be solved by a software engineer with enough time and interest in solving the problem.I will need to clear up the pricing page as it sounds like I didn't do a good job (great feedback thank you!) - it's basically $20/200 credits, and you can pay-as-you-go, and re-up for more whenever you want. We are early and delivering value is more important to me than extracting every dollar, especially out of a fellow founder who's early. If you geniunely find this useful, I would definitely chat and collaborate/partner to figure out something you think is fair, where you're getting value and you get to focus on your core competency. feel free to email me dexter at humanlayer dot dev\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019m just armchair quarterbacking here but I feel like you should just do all features for every user with a single $/action rate, then give discounts for volume and/or prepayment. Even saying $20/200 is a clunky statement. You could just say $0.10 per action (the fact that you\u2019re actually requiring me to make a $20 payment with a $20 charge once it gets to $10 or something like that isn\u2019t even important to me on a pricing page, although when you mention it later in the billing page make sure you also tell people it\u2019s a risk-free money back guarantee if that\u2019s the case)If there\u2019s something that truly has an incremental cost to you, like providing priority support, that goes into the \u201centerprise pricing\u201d section and you need to figure out how to quote that separately from the service. My guess is most people don\u2019t want to pay extra for that, or perhaps they\u2019d pay for some upfront integration support but ongoing support is not too important to them. Idk, that\u2019s just my guess here.\n \nreply",
      "thanks - definitely worth saying - I've thought a bit about the 10c/operation rather than 200/$20 - might give that a shot or A/B test a little\n \nreply",
      "Big systems like Salesforce started as small things that more deeply learned about and more deeply understood unmet demand and customer needs, and then got to packaging it in a way to create something that grows.Coding agents can help more with tasks and not quite big entire massive platforms on their own.  Humans may be able to scale much further and bigger with their skills.\n \nreply",
      "i like that angle...I also hear a lot that 'coding agents are great for prototypes, but we usually need a team to bring it to production'\n \nreply",
      "First congrats on the launch - I like it.My feedback: what\u2019s there looks inviting.  Email interaction is handy, other ways would be too.If there was a low code way to arrange the humanlayer primitives for folks at the edge of using it, I think human tasks could meet something like this even broader. Happy to chat offline.Onto your comment: The coding for coding agents is still kinda prototype.  It feels like some folks quietly have setup a very productive workflow themselves for quite sometime.Still, there no doubt you could ship production code in some cases - except ai needs to handle all the things development explicitly and implicitly checks before doing so.Getting to build some things that became more than few orders of magnitude larger than planned, one can learn a lot from the deep experiences of others\u2026 and I\u2019m not sure where that is in AI.  Speaking to someone with experience and insight can provide some profound insight, clarification and simplification.Still, an axiom for me remains: clever architecture still tends to beat clever coding.The best code often is the code that\u2019s not written and not maintained and hopefully the functionality can be achieved through interacting with the architecture.This approach is only one way, but it can take both domain knowledge and data knowledge, to put in enough a domain and data driven design relative to how well the developer may know the required and anticipated needs.The high end of software development is many leagues beyond even what I just described.  There\u2019s a lot of talk about 10x engineers, I\u2019d say there can be developers who definitely can be 10x as effective or reach 10x more of the solution, than average.If a lot of the code AI is modelled on is based on the body of code in repos, most on a wide scale may be average to above average at most, perfectly serviceable and iteratively updated.Sometimes we see those super elegant designs of fewer tables and code that does near everything, because it\u2019s developments 5th or 6th version creating major overhauls.  It could be refactored, or if the schema is not brittle, maybe a rewrite in full or part of the exact same team is present to do it.Today\u2019s AI could help shed a light in some of those directions, relative to the human using it. This again says in the hands of an expert developer AI can do a ton more for them, but the line to automation might be something else.There is agentic ai and human in the loop to still figure itself out, as well as how to improve the existing processes.  2025 looks to be interesting.\n \nreply"

I'm glad to see the interest here on this piece!I have slides that detail the problem setup and the mathematics, as well as a consideration of three-dimensional onions, here: https://drspoulsen.github.io/Onion_Marp/index.htmlI have submitted a formal write-up of the details of the problem and the solution to a recreational mathematics journal.I'm also happy to answer any questions about this!\n \nreply",

      "This is tremendously fun, thank you!Your solution seems to assume that all cuts need to be directed towards a single point, but doesn't it seem likely that an even more optimal solution increases h (depth of cut target) as the cuts move outward? Or did I miss a reason that's not the case?\n \nreply",

      "Would be really interesting if you could reverse engineer the model which yields 1/phi as the correct answer. Evidently for some non-uniform measure on the onion you could do it. What about for considering the onion as a half-ball? (Although if you're cooking it really is primarily the thickness that matters.)\n \nreply",
      "I love how deeply nerd-sniped you have been by this topic. It's wonderful to be able to observe your delight in solving this. Thank you for sharing.\n \nreply",

      "> First, we model the onion as half of a disc of radius one, with its center at the origin and existing entirely in the first two quadrants in a rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate system.Can someone explain to me why a half sphere (the shape of half an onion) can be modeled as a half-disk in this problem? Why would we expect the solutions to be the same? If you think about the outermost cross-sections at the ends of the onion (closest to the heel and tip of the knife), as you get closer and closer to the ends, you approach cutting these cross-sections more vertically. I'd expect that you'd have to make the center cross-section a bit shallower to \"make up\" for the fact that the outsides are being cut vertically. Idk, either way I think declaring this the true \"Onion constant\" is probably wrong.\n \nreply",
      "The solution is later in the article.> The insight that leads to a solution comes from the Jacobian.It's not a unform half disk. It has more weight away from the Y axis.You can imagine it's painted with watercolors and you want to collect the same ammount of ink.In an uniform disk you have    xx\n   xxxx\n   xxxx\n  xxxxxx\n  xxxxxx\n  xxxxxx\n\nBut in the weighted disk of the article the top and bottom are darker and the center lighter    ..\n   x..x\n   x..x\n   x..x\n  Xx..xX\n  Xx..xX\n  Xx..xX\n\nbut there are no strips like in my ASCII art, the shade changes slowly.\n \nreply"

      "> It's not just the size of Operation Gutt that is striking to the modern eye. It's also the oddity of the tool being used. Today, we control inflation with changes in interest rates, not changes in the quantity of money. To soften the effect of the global COVID monetary overhang, for instance, central banks in the U.S., Canada, and Europe began to raise rates in 2022 from around 0% to 4-5% in 2024.It's a bit more interesting than 'the central bank sets interest rates'.Simplified: the central bank decide on an interest rate that they want to see. By itself that decision doesn't do anything.What happens next is that they buy and sell government bonds in the open market.  The interest rate can be seen as the inverse of the price of bonds.If the central bank wants to see a lower interest rate, they buy bonds with freshly printed money to drive up their prices, ie drive down the interest rate.If the central banks wants to increase the prevailing interest rate, they sell government bonds from their inventory and essentially destroy they money they receive in return.So even when the language of modern central banking talks about interest rates, they still change the quantity of money to implement that.(This is all simplified, especially with the interest on excess reserves that was popular with the Fed for a while.  And there's also repos and reverse repos etc.)\n \nreply",
      "That's just one mechanism, but not the primary way in which the Fed controls interest rates.The Fed is a large provider of short-term loans (\"fed funds\") to cover interbank exchanges.It also is the lender of last resort and lends to banks directly (\"discount rate\").By changing these rates, the FED can influence the rates the banks charge each other for loans, and down the line to consumers.\n \nreply",

    "first_paragraph": "On the last day of 1945, with World War II finally behind it, Finland's government announced a new and very strange policy.All Finns were required to take out a pair of scissors and snip their banknotes in half. This was known in Finland as setelinleikkaus, or banknote cutting. Anyone who owned any of the three largest denomination Finnish banknotes\u00a0\u2014 the 5000 markka note, the 1000, or the 500\u00a0\u2014 was required to perform this operation immediately. The left side of the note could still be used to buy things, but at only half its value. So if a Finn had a 1000 markka note in their wallet, henceforth he or she could now only buy 500 markka worth of items at stores. As for the right side, it could no longer be spent and effectively became a bond (more on this later).Setelinleikkaus was Finland's particular response to the post-War European problem of \"monetary overhang,\" described in a 1990 paper by economists Rudi Dornbusch and Holger Wolf.
