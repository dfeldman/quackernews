      "I installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a after Google deleted the battery life[0], and while the initial move was frustrating with things not working, I've adapted and have a nice feeling of security while using my device again. It feels like it's mine, and I don't have to worry about who will spy on me or rug-pull me next.[0] https://grapheneos.social/@GrapheneOS/113917226566692707\n \nreply",
      "> deleted the battery life[0]Such a bizarre phenomenon to me that people are still griping about a software update that stops a 4-year-old battery from detonating when the same company will also fix the phone for free or just hand you $50 if you prefer that.\n \nreply",
      "The fixing offer is only valid in some locations, would require you to be without your phone for some time, and since Android still doesn't have anything that would be considered working backup and restore, I can't imagine many people being comfortable mailing their phone out for a replacement.The $50 \"cash\" offer came with so many downsides that just ignoring it would be the smarter choice for anyone who values their time (someone already provided a link).\n \nreply",

      "I don't have any idea what the situation is here and whether it's as black and white as you paint it, but regardless, surely something as significant as this should be presented to the user as an option rather than the manufacturer deciding for you that your phone that you own and paid for should now be unusable?\n \nreply",
      "They pushed an update that by GrapheneOS's estimation was most likely for a critical safety issue. For devices that are affected, they're also offering to replace the battery for free to restore functionality back to the way it was.Assuming there was in fact a critical safety issue with these old batteries, that seems like the best possible course of action they could have taken: no one's house burns down or whatever and everyone gets the chance to get a free battery replacement on a 5-year-old phone that was likely down to fractional capacity already anyway.

      "Note that this blog post (and the associated video) were a quick off-the-cuff thing while I was on the NAB show floor\u2014I have been talking to a few of those involved in the testing at NIST, Sinclair, and Avateq (among others), and will hopefully have a lot more in a follow-up.Right now it's in the experimental stage, with only 6 towers total deployed (only 5 were operational during NAB, and only one in Nevada... so timing, not navigation yet).The ultimate plan\u2014which is probably dependent on how well ATSC 3.0 rolls out (which has plenty of hurdles[1])\u2014is to encourage broadcasters to add on the necessary timing equipment to their transmitter sites, to build a mesh network for timing.That would allow the system to be 100% independent of GPS (time transfer could be done via dark fiber and/or ground-satellite-ground directly to some 'master' sites).The advantages for BPS are coverage (somewhat) inside buildings, the ability to have line of sight nearly everywhere in populated areas, and resilience to jamming you can't get with GPS (a 100 kW transmitter signal 10 miles away is a lot harder to defeat than a weak GPS signal hundreds of miles away in the sky).The demo on the show floor was also using eLoran to distribute time from a site in Nevada to the transmitter facility on Black Mountain outside Vegas, showing a way to be fully GPS-independent (though the current eLoran timing was sourced from GPS).[1] ATSC 3.0, as it is being rolled out in the US, doesn't even add on 4K (just 1080p HDR), and tacks on 'features' like 'show replay' (where you tap a button and an app can stream a show you're watching on OTA TV through the Internet... amazing! /s), DRM (at stations' discretion, ugh), and 'personalized ad injection' (no doubt requiring you to connect your TV to the Internet so advertisers can get your precise location too...). Because ATSC 3.0 requires new hardware, consumers have to be motivated to buy new TVs or converter boxes\u2014I don't see anything that motivates me to do so. I feel like it may be a lot like the (forever ongoing) HD Radio rollout.\n \nreply",

A few years ago, on a bit of a lark, I bought a (used) fairly high-end Keysight logic analyzer. The kind of thing that cost like $20,000 or more when it was brand new. But I got a sweet deal on it, so I bought it. Only... it came with no test leads. And then I started shopping for the leads.Yikes.I forget the exact numbers now, but as best as I can recall, the leads came in 64pin sets, where the device supported up to 4 test lead sets, for 256 total channels. And just one of the 64pin test lead sets cost something like $1500. So a full set would cost another $6000 on top of the device itself. I think that was about what I paid for the analyzer itself in the first place!Now I don't regret buying it and in truth I never needed to use 256 channels anyway, so I only bought 1 of the test lead sets so far.

      "It's amusing that Xe managed to turn what was historically mostly a joke/shitpost into an actually useful product. They did always say timing was everything.I am kind of surprised how many sites seem to want/need this. I get the slow git pages problem for some of the git servers that are super deep, lack caches, serve off slow disks, etc.Unesco surprised me some, the sub-site in question is pretty big, it has thousands of documents of content, but the content is static - this should be trivial to serve, so what's going on? Well it looks like it's a poorly deployed Wordpress on top of Apache, with no caching enabled, no content compression, no HTTP 2/3. It would likely be fairly easy to get this serving super cheap on a very small machine, but of course doing so requires some expertise, and expertise still isn't cheap.Sure you could ask an LLM, but they still aren't good at helping when you have no clue what to ask - if you don't even really know the site is slower than it should be, why would you even ask? You'd just hear about things getting crushed and reach for the furry defender.\n \nreply",

The HTML source would be effectively void without the user session, meaning an OTP like behavior could also make web pages unreadable once the assets go uncached.This would allow to effectively create a captcha that would modify the local seed window until the user can read a specified word. \"Move the slider until you can read the word Foxtrott\", for example.I sure would love to hear your input, Xe.

      "Before discussions go into some generic direction about the field. This is a huge feasibility study contain different aspects done by hundreds of people. People who are mostly interested about the physics case of FCC should read/skim at least through the first volume [1], second chapter (Specificities of the FCC physics case) the first four sections. This is about 35 pages with somehow accessible language to people with some physics knowledge.Personally I'm interested in their proposal about how they are going to approach software (Section 8). They plan to provide experiment agnostic and unified framework that is actually unified and user accessible. The field really need something like that, it is usually the pain point of most junior graduate student. The field suck at documentation and keep coherent software and write code in a bad way most of the time.

It's much cheaper and faster to do theory, then built what you need to verify, than to crank up energy as high as you can and hope for the best (I'd hazard a guess this ran out of steam by the 50s/60s at the latest)\n \nreply",
      "> There hasn't been a significant new particle discovery, but none was expected other than HiggsThe word \"expected\" is doing a lot of work in that sentence.At least one kind of Higgs had to be found unless the mass generation mechanism of the Standard Model and all its proposed extensions (MSSM etc) was categorically wrong; the LHC was designed to cover the entire mass range where it had to be. In that sense, the Higgs was strictly expected.But if you had asked a bunch of phenomenologists \"What new thing do you expect to be found first at the LHC?\", most would have gone for one or more superpartners. The Higgs' hierarchy problem [1] was believed to require electroweak-scale SUSY, which in turn implied the existence of electroweak-scale supersymmetric partners to the known SM particles. Those would have been easier to find than the Higgs, so they would have shown up earlier in the data, before there was enough of it to also discern a Higgs bump.You could argue that superpartners were not expected with the same degree of certainty as some kind of Higgs, but the absence of any sign of SUSY was a big disappointment, and the beginning of the end for what had become the dominating scenario for Beyond Standard Model physics.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_problem#Supersymmetr...\n \nreply",

      "ArkType is a really interesting library that has a difficult time marketing itself. More than being a schema validator, it brings TS types into the runtime, so you can programmatically work with types as data with (near?) full fidelity.I've been evaluating schema libraries for a better-than-Zod source of truth, and ArkType is where I've been focused. Zod v4 just entered beta[1], and it improves many of my problems with it. For such a mature library to improve like this, v4 is treat and speaks volumes to the quality of engineering. But ArkType has a much larger scope, and feels to me more like a data modeling language than a library. Something I definitely want as a dev!The main downside I see is that its runtime code size footprint is much larger than Zod. For some frontends this may be acceptable, but it's a real cost that isn't wise to pay in many cases. The good news is with precompilation[2] I think ArkType will come into its own and look more like a language with a compiler, and be suitable for lightweight frontends too.[1] https://v4.zod.dev/v4[2] https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/810\n \nreply",

      "I've spent a little time in this space, and I'm not sure it's a good idea to write shaders in Rust, although it's probably better than GLSL or WGSL.Let me start with the pros:1. Don't have to learn 2 different languages2. Modules, crates, and the easier ability to share code3. Easier sharing between rust structs and shader code.Now the cons, in comparison to Slang [1]1. No autodiff mode\n2. Strictly outputs SPIR-V, while Slang can do CPU, CUDA, Pytorch, Optix, and all the major graphics APIs3. Less support - Slang is supported by the Khronos group, and Slang gets use at Nvidia, EA, and Valve.4. Safety isn't very valuable, most GPU code does not use pointers (it's so rare it's considered a feature by Slang!)5. slangc probably runs a lot faster than rustc (although I would like to see a benchmark.)6. Worse debugging experience, slang has better interop with things like NSight Graphics, and their Shader Debugger. Slang recently got support in NSight graphics for shader profiling, for example.7. Slang has support for reflection, and has a C++ api to directly output a JSON file that contains all the reflected aspects.This makes handling the movement between rust <-> gpu much easier. Also, the example shown on the website uses `bytemuck`, but `bytemuck` won't take into consideration the struct alignment rules[2] when using WebGPU. Instead, you have to use a crate like `encase`[3] to handle that. I'm not sure given the example on the website how it would work with WebGPU.8. If you have pre-existing shaders in GLSL or HLSL, you can use slangc directly on them. No need to rewrite.9. In reality, you may not have to learn 2 languages but you have to learn 2 different compute models (CPU vs GPU). This is actually a much harder issue, and AFAICT it is impossible to overcome with a different language. The problem is the programmer needs to understand how the platforms are different.[1] https://shader-slang.org/\n[2] https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/resources/wgsl...

      "Had not heard of Slang, thanks for sharing.It's interesting that Slang looks more like Rust than WGSL does, despite WGSL kind of being de facto \"owned by\" the Rust community.\n \nreply",
      "Anyone have recommendations for resources for learning to write shaders?\n \nreply",
      "I've always enjoyed watching The Art of Code[1], Freya[2] also has a good number of videos on it.But that is just vertex shaders for things like Shadertoys.There is much more to computer graphics or GPGPU than this though, Im still learning about that myself X).[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKtsY7hYTPg\n[2]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfM-yu0iQBk\n \nreply",
      "If you want to make nice looking materials and effects, you need a combination of good lighting (comes from the rendering engine, not the material), and artistic capabilities/talent. Art is a lot harder to teach than programming I feel, or at least I don't know how to teach it.Programming the shaders themselves are pretty simple imo, they're just pure functions that return color data or triangle positions. The syntax might be a little different than you're used to depending on the shader language, but it should be easy enough to pick up in a day.If you want to write compute shaders for computation, then it gets a lot more tricky and you need to spend some time learning about memory accesses, the underlying hardware, and profiling.\n \nreply",

      "This is big news. Shaders have been a pain to develop for in Unity. If I can program them in Rust, leveraging Rust's tooling and ecosystem, that would be huge.\n \nreply",
      "Very exciting project! Does this work on M-series macs? I've had trouble running some shaders on my laptop before.\n \nreply",
      "I understand the sentiment but to be very pedantic most GPUs do not understand SPIRV, it\u2019s the drivers that do.\n \nreply",
      "> While over-all better alternatives to both languages exist, none of them are in a place to replace *HLSL* or *GLSL*. Either because they are vendor locked, or because they don't support the traditional graphics pipeline. Examples of this include *CUDA* and *OpenCL*.Are CUDA and OpenCL really \"better alternatives\" to HLSL and GLSL?CUDA and OpenCL are compute languages; HLSL and GLSL and shader languages. And while one can theoretically do compute in a shader (and we used to!) or shaders in a compute language, I think it's dishonest to claim that CUDA is intended as an updated alternative to GLSL. It's simply apples and oranges.\n \nreply"

      "We stuck with Yup and ignored Joi, Zod and god knows what else has come down the pipeline since. Rather than wasting time upgrading, we've instead built useful features.That said, we are slowly phasing out our React frontend for one of our apps page by page and replacing it with what we use over the rest of apps: Phoenix + Liveview. The changeset system for validations has proven itself time and time again to both be fast but also to handle many of the curly validation problems we might have. It also has barely changed since its release.If you have a disciplined frontend team then you might be able to make it work. They have to be able to ignore the latest shiny thing that has come along, but if you don't then you'll have a team that is busy constantly upgrading to the latest shiny library rather than getting anything done.\n \nreply",
      "We\u2019ve been using LiveView for years now and I still really miss the ergonomics that you get with typescript.A lot of that is going away with better LSP support and better LLM suggestions.But elixir and LiveView are generally great (I LOVE ecto), but building component frameworks and component communication still feels a bit janky.\n \nreply",
      "I've used LiveView a little in the past, and besides the lack of static typing (at the time, I think Elixir has gotten some type annotations since), I really liked it and found it easy to work with.Ecto though, I could never figure out how to use. If I could just make SQL queries in an ORM-style I would understand it, but the repositories and auto generated relations and such I couldn't figure out. Do you have any good resources for learning ecto? I didn't find the official docs helpful.\n \nreply",
      "I only use Zod in a single library, so my experience with it is pretty minimal. One thing I have really enjoyed with it is the low maintenance.So, when I saw this post and read the first few paragraphs, I was filled with dread for having to do yet another major dependency update. Reading of all the improvements- surly the \u2018breaking changes\u2019 list must be massive.Having read the full article, it seems like the breaking changes have been kept within reason. One major improvement that stands out to me is the improved Recursive types support, but there is certainly any number of improvements for others to be excited about.The thing I enjoyed most is that excitement of the Arthur really shines throughout the whole article. I\u2019m so thankful this library exists and is being lovingly maintained by someone who is genuinely interested in it.\n \nreply",

      "I used to use Zod until I realised it\u2019s rather big (for many projects this isn\u2019t an issue at all, but for some it is). Now I use Valibot which is basically the same thing but nice and small. I do slightly prefer Zod\u2019s API and documentation, though.Edit to add: aha, now I read further in the announcement, looks like @zod/mini may catch up with valibot -- it uses the same function-based design at least, so unused code can be stripped out.\n \nreply",
      "Surprised not to see more people ask about performance profile of v4.Zod is great in terms of API, but a no-go in terms of performance.We ended up writing babel plugins (https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-zod/) and using it along with zod-accelerator, which improves performance, but breaks in various edge-cases.\n \nreply",
      "I guess people are not asking because the article contains benchmarks\n \nreply",
      "I've created some crazy types with zod since v3 released, these look like really interesting changes for v4.I've been bit by performance issues, and even a few issues where I just couldn't infer types, with some of the more complex schemas I tried to define, especially with multiple .extend() and .omit() calls.The zod-mini library looks particularly interesting. I don't mind the more functional approach with nested functions rather than chaining. Reminds me of ramda, that library is pretty massive but still easy to tree shake since everything is functional.\n \nreply",
      "My team has been building a greenfield SaaS app for the past ~9 months and when we started, we went all in on Zod and so far the experience has been pretty fantastic. Zod is very intuitive to use and being able to generate typescript types off the schemas is very useful. Though with that said if you're already using Yup or Joi I don't recommend switching as there's just not enough of a reason to switch over.\n \nreply"

      "What this makes me wonder is whether hunger would also affect other \"gut\" decisions by biasing towards direct sensory perceptual features and away from \"cognitive\" features.  This would be sort of like the stuff about how judges allegedly handed down harsher sentences just before lunch.  But you could imagine similar stuff on other judgment tasks where bias of various kinds can exist, like \"how friendly is this person\" or \"which of these places would you like to go to?\"Looking at food and evaluating it for how good it is to eat is something we humans have evolved to do over thousands of years.  Things like \"NutriScores\" have only existed for a few decades, and the details of them continue to vary from place to place and on a small timescale, so even people who are exposed to them can't always interpret them.  This study can be interpreted as saying that we're more likely to use \"primal\" means to solve \"primal\" needs (e.g., use visual attributes of food to solve a need for food), and de-emphasize complex, culturally-derived tools like writing and numbers.  It would be interesting to know how general that tendency is.I also enjoyed that the photo is of a person eating a hamburger and the study was done on students at the University of Hamburg.\n \nreply",
