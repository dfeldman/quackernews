      "Having worked in the space, I'd have to say hardware encoders and H.264 is pretty dang good - NVENC works with very little latency (if you tell it to, and disable the features that increase it, such as multiple frame prediction, B-frames).The two things that increase latency are more advanced processing algorithms, giving the encoder more stuff to do, and schemes that require waiting multiple frames. If you go disable those, the encoder can pretty much start working on your frame the nanosecond the GPU stops rendering to it, and have it encoded in <10ms.reply",

      "I know next to nothing about video encoding, but I feel like there should be so much low hanging fruit when it comes to videogame streaming if the encoder just cooperated with the game engine even slightly. Things like motion prediction would be free since most rendering engines already have a dedicated buffer just for that for its own rendering, for example. But there's probably some nasty patent hampering innovation there, so might as well forget it!reply",
      "'Motion vectors' in H.264 are a weird bit twiddling/image compression hack and have nothing to do with actual motion vectors.- In a 3d game, a motion vector is the difference between the position of an object in 3d space from the previous to the current frame- In H.264, the 'motion vector' is basically saying - copy this rectangular chunk of pixels from some point from some arbitrary previous frame and then encode the difference between the reference pixels  and the copy with JPEG-like techniques (DCT et al)This block copying is why H.264 video devolves into a mess of squares once the bandwidth craps out.reply",

It sends inputs, but gets a compressed stream.  Im curious of any OS of something similar.reply",
      "For 2d sprite games, OMG yes, you could provide some very accurate motion vectors to the encoder. For 3d rendered games, I'm not so sure.

Ideally, we want all of this to complete in roughly ~20 ms.To make this use case work well, we have to strangle the codecs quite a bit. Modern video codecs love latency since it allows tricks like flexible rate control and B-frames.

Blue team is basically brain storming.(b) AlphaEvolve is an example of an explicit \"red/blue team\" approach in his sense, although they don't use those terms [0]. Tao was an advisor to that paper.(c) This is also reminiscent of the \"verifier/falsifier\" division of labor in game semantics. This may be the way he's actually thinking about it, since he has previously said publicly that he thinks in these terms [0]. The \"blue/red\" wording may be adapting it for an audience of programmers.(d) Nitpicking: a security system is not only as strong as its weakest link. This depends on whether there are layers of security or if the elements are in parallel. A corridor consisting of strong doors and weak doors (in series) is as strong as the strongest door. A fraud detection algorithm made by aggregating weak classifiers is often much better than the weakest classifier.[0] https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/B...[1] https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38639/thinking-and-explai...reply",

Maybe that's true, but I'd feel the same about the prospect of loosing ripgrep for a week, or whatever. Loosing it for a couple of days is more palatable.Also, I find it notable they said this will affect \"less than 5% of users\".

      "I've been using sqlx with postgres for several months now on a production server with decent query volume all day long. It has been rock solid.I find writing sql in rust with sqlx to be far fewer lines of code than the same in Go. This server was ported from Go and the end result was ~40% fewer lines of code, less memory usage and stable cpu/memory usage over time.reply",
      "Speaking of Go, if you want compile-time type checking like what SQLx offers, the Go ecosystem has an option that is arguably even better at it:https://sqlc.dev/It has the advantage that it implements the parsing and type checking logic in pure Go, allowing it to import your migrations and infer the schema for type checking. With SQLx you need to have your database engine running at compile time during the proc macro execution with the schema already available. This makes SQLx kind of a non-starter for me, though I understand why nobody wants to do what sqlc does (it involves a lot of duplication that essentially reimplements database features.) (Somewhat ironically it's less useful for sqlc to do this since it runs as code generation outside the normal compilation and thus even if it did need a live database connection to do the code generation it would be less of an impact... But it's still nice for simplicity.)reply",
      "It's possible to run sqlx in 'offline' mode that uses your schema to do the checks so you don't need a live database. That's a popular option in CI/CD scenarios.reply",
      "Offline query caching is great. The team has made it work fantastically for workspace oriented monorepos too.I ran sqlx / mysql on a 6M MAU Actix-Web website with 100kqps at peak with relatively complex transactions and queries. It was rock solid.I'm currently using sqlx on the backend and on the desktop (Tauri with sqlite).In my humble opinion, sqlx is the best, safest, most performant, and most Rustful way of writing SQL. The ORMs just aren't quite there.I wish other Rust client libraries were as nice as sqlx. I consider sqlx to be one of Rust's essential crates.reply",
      "I never gelled with how SQLC needs to know about your schema via the schema file. I'm used to flyway where you can update the schema as long as it's versioned correctly such that running all the sets of flyways will produce the same db schema.I referred go-jet since it introspects the database for it's code generation instead.reply",
      "The way I prefer to use sqlc is in combination with a schema migration framework like goose. It actually is able to read the migration files and infer the schema directly without needing an actual database. This seems to work well in production.reply",
      "This is why I like using NodeJS or Python with SQL, it's very simple to have it not care about the return types. SQL is already statically typed per se, I don't need to re-assert everything. Achieving the same kind of automation in Go etc requires parsing the schema at compile-time like what you described, which is complicated.reply",
      "I spent 2 weeks trying to build a very basic rest crud API with SQLc and it was not better. I had to shift to SQLx because of how unintuitive SQLc was.reply",
      "We've been running SQLC in production for a while now and I'm curious which part of it you found unintuitive? We run ours as a container service within the development environment that will compile your code from a postgres dump file. We've had no issues with it at all after the initial configuration guidelines for SQLC, though the documentation certainly isn't exactly great. Hell, I'm not sure I've ever worked with a better SQL to language tool in my decades so I'm surprised that it isn't working out for you.That being said, as I understand it, SQLx does something very different. If you want dynamic queries, you'll basically have to build that module yourself. The power of SQLC is that anyone who can write SQL can work on the CRUD part of your Go backend, even if they don't know Go. Hell, we've even had some success with business domain experts who added CRUD functionality by using LLM's to generate SQL. (We do have a lot of safeguards around that, to make it less crazy than it sounds).If you want fancy Linq, grapQL, Odata or even a lot of REST frameworks, you're not getting any of that with SQLC though, but that's typically not what you'd want from a Go backend in my experience. Might as well build it with C# or Java then.reply",
      "It's quite simple really. I want to write a query and have a concrete object as it's return type. The framework that gets me there in the least amount of steps is going to be more intuitive.Let's compare:\nSQLC\n- configuration file (yaml/json)\n- schema files\n- query files\n- understand the meta language in query file comments to generate code you wantSQLx\n- env: DATABASE_URLNow does that mean that SQLx is the best possible database framework. No, it does not. Because I didn't spend my time doing things that weren't related to the exact queries I had to write I got more work done.I want to appreciate the hard work the SQLx Devs have put in to push the bar for a decent SQL developer experience. People give them a really hard time for certain design decisions, pending features and bugs. I've seen multiple comments calling it's compile time query validation \"gimmicky\" and that's not nice at all. You can go to any other language and you won't find another framework that is as easy to get started with.reply"

      "One interesting thing I learned from this was how they determined the probable size of this comet probabilistically, rather than using direct observation - basically, based on the observations, it could either be really big (10km) or really small (0.5km), and we can basically rule out really big because we've been looking for comets for years, and during that time, to see one that is that big implies that we _should have seen_ thousands that are quite small over that time period, because the size of space objects follows a power law since they're always whacking into each other and breaking up. Since we've only seen one small interstellar object during that time rather than thousands, a large comet is so impossibly unlikely that we can conclude that it is 0.5km in size.

I don\u2019t think that supposition is fair, but it is not escapable as an individual. That being said to the extent that the functionality available is useful regardless of the user\u2019s expertise, I think that is valuable. Granted, you will never avoid inherent complexity, for example the task of being an informed citizen does not become easier with better tools, but the inefficiency can be reduced. The user still must participate, however the unnecessary impediments can be removed.

I think the most pressing challenge is that the sources with the resources required to publish their perspectives are, rarely, if ever, acting in the interest of their audience\u2026 they have an agenda. Realistically speaking, even if complex systems were made easier to use, the vast majority of people who could benefit from adopting them would choose not to do so simply because of their own lack of awareness of the \u201cwhy\u201d or justification to do so.

      "I enjoy the concept, and think you could be onto something -  but it seemed a bit too easy to be satisfying. I think the path to solving the puzzle is a bit too straightforward. That is, removing a letter one by one WILL get you to the solution, and there\u2019s not enough of a cognitive work-out to figure out the next one to remove.I don\u2019t have a solution mind you, but having made Stackdown and been on a similar journey, I needed the feedback to get it where it is now.Keep going!Oh, also I really like the tidy design.reply",
      "My only confusion was when I\u2019d correctly reduced one word to the required for the phrase, but didn\u2019t get any feedback that it was correct. I didn\u2019t understand why it wouldn\u2019t accept my \u201cvalid\u201d shorter wordreply",
      "Fun, but like others have said, felt somewhat easy. Or really, it feels like the gameplay is too short. Maybe you can shrink down a word, then replace it with a longer synonym or something, and repeat? That way you get a couple rounds of gameplay per puzzle.reply",
      "Would it be possible to have 3-4 words and you have to make sure that each word you produce results in a valid phrase?  So not only the final phrase makes sense, but you have to navigate through a path of valid phrases.This way you might remove a letter from different words and have to think ahead to decide if the result would remain coherent in order to avoid an error.The computational complexity of identifying phrases that can be reduced like this while having a coherent path might increase rapidly.reply",

      "Funny, but a bit too easy, I think. At least, I got a warning when I made an error (my only one), which makes light work of progress. The fact that I had only one error is an indication of the ease (I'm not a native speaker of English), and complex puzzling usually involves backtracking or multiple tries to achieve a single step.reply",

      "This whole Copilot vs HUD debate instantly brought to mind a classic Japanese anime from 1991 called Future GPX Cyber Formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_GPX_Cyber_Formula). Yeah, it\u2019s a racing anime set in the then-distant future of 2015, where cars come with full-on intelligent AIs.The main character\u2019s car, Asurada, is basically a \"Copilot\" in every sense. It was designed by his dad to be more than just a tool, more like a partner that learns, adapts, and grows with the driver. Think emotional support plus tactical analysis with a synthetic voice.Later in the series, his rival shows up driving a car that feels very much like a HUD concept. It's all about cold data, raw feedback, and zero bonding. Total opposite philosophy.What\u2019s wild is how accurately it captures the trade-offs we\u2019re still talking about in 2025. If you\u2019re into human-AI interaction or just want to see some shockingly ahead-of-its-time design thinking wrapped in early '90s cyber aesthetics, it\u2019s absolutely worth a watch.reply",
      "The Anime Yukikaze (2002 - 2005) has some similar themes. It's about a fighter jet pilot using a new AI-supported jet to fight against aliens. It asserts that the combination of human intuition and artificial intelligence trumps either of the two on its own. If I remember correctly, the jet can pilot on its own, but when it becomes dangerous, the human pilot only uses the AI hints instead of letting it autopilot.reply",
      "I wish Kambayashi was just more widely known. Or Japanese Sci-Fis and LNs in general. There have been couple legitimate \"oh that's now reality\" moments for me in real world developments of AI.reply",

      "This is I\u2019d say partially because we don\u2019t have a HUD that can handle the bandwidth and pace of data required for rally. Overlaying a visualization of the turns ahead would be much better than a copilot for surereply",
      "It will be fun when we get to the era where this is bulletproof-reliable to this extent, but for now, recorded notes with accelerometer-backed GPS locations are probably a better idea than hoping the AI will be able to do this for you dynamically without you driving off a cliff.reply",

They were grappling with many of the same issues we\u2019re discussing in 2025: how to make a personal assistant that automates tasks for you and knows your full context. They even had a human \u201cbutler\u201d on stage representing an AI agent.Everyone was super excited about this\u2026 except Weiser. He was opposed to the whole idea of agents! He gave this example: how should a computer help you fly a plane and avoid collisions?The agentic option is a \u201ccopilot\u201d \u2014 a virtual human who you talk with to get help flying the plane.

      "Standard Debian-with-root Arm package repo in pKVM hardware-nested VM with OpenGL (v)GPU remoting! So many years of upstream work across Linux, Android and ChromeOS to make this possible. Now we need phone/tablet OEMs to support Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) and OpenTitan-derived enclaves, so this feature can move beyond Pixel hardware.https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2025/01/15/the-...> GFX virtualization aims at providing support for hardware accelerated 3D graphics in virtual machines. Unlike GPU-passthrough, with GFX virtualization the host and all VM guests can access the host GPU simultaneously. Vulkan and OpenGL are supported by virglrenderer using various approaches.. vDRM is a much thinner layer.. able to achieve native GPU performance, where VirGL and Venus may struggle to overcome expensive host/guest synchronizations..at the beginning of 2025, vDRM is partially supported by crosvm.Hopefully Google's phone-tablet-laptop-desktop convergence of Android, ChromeOS and developer-targeted Debian Linux will motivate Apple to restore iPadOS 16.2 (2022!) virtualization support, https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/discussions/5748.reply",
