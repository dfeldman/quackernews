      "> Matthew Olm (opens a new tab), a physiologist who studies the human microbiome at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was not involved with the study, is \u201cinherently skeptical\u201d of the idea that populations of microbes could live in the brain, he said. But he found the new research convincing. \u201cThis is concrete evidence that brain microbiomes do exist in vertebrates,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the idea that humans have a brain microbiome is not outlandish.\u201dIt's interesting to me that it would ever have been considered outlandish. In light of everything we now know about microbiomes and microbiology in general, it seems to me as a layman that the more radical proposition would be that the blood-brain barrier would be 100% effective at keeping out all bacteria, rather than the proposition that it probably isn't but that the bacteria it does let in tend to be symbiotic.\n \nreply",
      ">  it seems to me as a layman that the more radical proposition would be that the blood-brain barrier would be 100% effective at keeping out all bacteria,Bacteria is not usually found in most organs in the body though. Even more so in an organ as important as the brain that even our own immune system doesn't have access. The brain has its own cells to do that job. In order for bacteria to cross the blood brain barrier you need bacteria in the blood first, where they aren't normally found without getting under fire.Having bacteria in the gut is more obvious and makes more sense.\n \nreply",
      "Agreed. Additionally, one of the mechanisms keeping the gut bacteria from taking over the rest of the body is an oxygen gradient: anaerobic bacteria in the gut are unlikely to be interested in an exploration of the aerobic environment of the body.  Oxygen diffuses freely across the blood brain barrier, so it would not serve as an analogous containment mechanism.\n \nreply",
      "The lungs, mammary glands, uterus, ovaries, vagina, placenta, semen, eyes, skin, and nasal cavity all have their own documented microbiome so far, and we've been finding out about new microbiomes about once a year. They are not a thing that is reserved for the digestive tract.\n \nreply",
      "If you were to simplify the human body to a sphere (or torus... or whatever corresponds with the number of orifices that a human has), then all of the microbiomes you've listed would be on the exterior.  The brain (and heart and kidneys and liver and bones and...) would not be.The microflora  would need to have gotten there somehow, something analogous to endosymbiosis. But unless they're somehow getting from brain-to-egg-to-brain that's hard to explain. As for the others, they're easier, all being along the surfaces. Even the gut is on the \"outside\" in that membranes need not be crossed in order to access it.Although counterpoint: the same argument would apply to a fish so I guess it's not impossible. Just more surprising.\n \nreply",

      "I suppose I have perfect pitch, in that I can more often than not:  * aurally identify key signatures\n  * aurally identify chords\n  * sing a given note on command\n\nIt wasn't until I was into my early twenties that I could do this. For me, the single biggest stepping stone was building the connection between what I could hear in my head from a song that I remember clearly with the underlying music theory.Specifically, building up a library of knowledge regarding the key signature of songs I liked:  * Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb\" is in B minor\n  * The famous motif in Beethoven's 5th is in C minor\n  * Blues Traveller's \"Hook\" is in A\n  * Regina Spektor's \"Eet\" is in D-flat\n  * Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is F minor\n  * etc.\n\nThen, make connections based upon that. Want to sing a B? Just recall the opening, sustained keyboard chord in \"Comfortably Numb\". Huh, The Beatles \"Across The Universe\" sounds tonally like \"Eet\" - I guess it is also in D-flat.A simple way to do this is to make playlists for a given key, which helps reinforce the sense of shared tonality across songs.\n \nreply",
      "> A simple way to do this is to make playlists for a given key, which helps reinforce the sense of shared tonality across songs.This is gold. I similarly maintain lists of melodies that prominently feature certain intervals.\n \nreply",
      "Absolute pitch: a completely useless skill, which having can in some cases even be detrimental. While being very hard to impossible to acquire. So naturally I will stop at nothing trying to develop it :)A couple of months ago, this paper made the rounds: Absolute pitch in involuntary musical imagery [0]. In a small sample group, nearly half the time (44.7%) when someone was asked to sing their current earworm, were they perfectly in pitch. Random chance would be 8.3%.It\u2019s a fun thing to try for yourself. Just hum your current earworm into a voice memo, and check the correct pitch against the recording of the original song. You may discover a skill you never knew you had, implicit perfect pitch on involuntary music!Trying to make this more interesting, reproducing a particular song on demand (there\u2019s references to that too in the paper - it also works better than random chance, but less so than the involuntary kind), I find it works best for songs that start off with a single note, preferably sung. Or then at least you can immediately check whether you were right, e.g. \u201cTom\u2019s Diner\u201d. I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun humming the first tone to Laufey\u2019s cover of Sunny side of the street [1] whenever I open YouTube. I\u2019m more often right than wrong, and if I was wrong, I can just listen to the whole thing to brighten my day anyways.[0]: https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-024-02936-0[1]: https://youtu.be/wK6gbKC90Ps\n \nreply",
      "This is really a fun skill to learn that you have. I've had a pretty good ear for relative pitch since birth, which my music teachers picked up on right away (I could play songs \"by ear\" after hearing them a couple of times), but I struggled with blind pitch in the mornings... until I realized that, for whatever reason, I can hear the theme from Zora's Domain in perfect clarity in the proper key.I used that to fake absolute pitch for a while in college, then explained to my voice coach what I was doing, and he looked at me like I had three heads. I'll never forget it. :)\n \nreply",
      "I find I can recall something with accurate pitch, but the \"memory\" of that pitch fades over time.  Whatever my current favorite song is, I can hum it at the right pitch.  But, if I were to try to do so a month later, it will probably be transposed a bit because I somehow lost that sense of the exact correct pitch.  My idea of what \"feels right\" in that regard somehow fades, or something...\n \nreply",
      "> By the end of freshman year, I had significantly expanded my musical tastes and unambiguously had perfect pitch\u2026 for piano only. I find it highly unlikely that this was due to identifying microtuning differences;I think the more convincing theory for instrument-specific perfect pitch is that one learns to recognize the timbres of the individual notes, not any minute variations in pitch.> Don\u2019t learn a non-C instrumentI would recommend against this because it severely limits your options for instruments to play.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, this advice doesn't hold up--even the OP mentions learning the clarinet, which is a B-flat instrument. I also play the clarinet and developed the same ability to detect each note by its timbre. I also think there is a kinesthetic element to each note--the way the instrument vibrates, the back-pressure or resistance you feel while playing, that becomes associated with the timbre the longer you play.\n \nreply",

      "Not quite music, but I had quite the adventure learning pitch perception as it applies to languages.As an adult I learnt to speak Japanese. Japanese has a pitch accent that is used to discriminate certain words. For example \u7bb8 (chopsticks) and \u6a4b(bridge) are both \"hashi\" but with a different pitch accent.  Event though I spoke Japanese for years I couldn't hear the difference.  With isolated words spoken slowly and carefully I could maybe perceive some difference, but in normal speech at normal speed it just wasn't there.  Even without this I could have normal conversations without issue so it didn't bother me too much.One weekend I sat down and spent the entire weekend listening to words and guessing the pitch accent.  Hear word, guess pitch accent, check answer.  I must have spent a good 10+ hours doing that. Thousands and thousands of words.  After a while I could actually hear the difference. For me it didn't feel like a difference in pitch, more like a subtle difference in emphasis. It's a very hard feeling to describe.  It kind of feels like learning to see a new color. It was always there but you never noticed it before.Another goal of mine is to learn relative pitch for music.  There are training apps out there and I'm convinced that if I do a similar amount of practice on mass I will be able to hear the difference between a fourth and a fifth and so on.\n \nreply",

      "To me, this basically says \"LLMs aren't pre-trained on enough 1D timeseries data\" - there's a classic technique in time series analysis where you just do a wavelet or FFT on the time series and feed it into a convnet as an image, leveraging the massive pre-training on, e.g. ImageNet. This \"shouldn't\" be the best way to do it, since a giant network should learn a better internal representation than something static like FFT or a wavelet transform. But there's no 1D equivalent of ImageNet so it still often works better than a 1D ConvNet trained from scratch.Same applies here. An LLM trained on tons of time series should be able to create its own internal representation that's much more effective than looking at a static plot, since plots can't represent patterns at all scales (indeed, a human plotting to explore data will zoom in, zoom out, transform the timeseries, etc.). But since LLMs don't have enough 1D timeseries pretraining, the plot-as-image technique leverages the massive amount of image pre-training.\n \nreply",
      "For training AI MLPs to predict time-series data that's known to have sinusoidal behaviors (which might lead to 'reasoning' like it did in LLMs) I bet it's more efficient to first curve-fit the data onto continuous data points, and then convert to frequency domain (like you said, FFT), and then do all the training using just \"Frequency Domain\" datasets. So then the way the AI would \"predict\" (run inference) would be by spitting out Frequency Domain predictions, which have to be converted back to 'time domain' to get the 'real output'.I'm sure the audio-processing AI systems out there are doing something like this already so it would be interesting to try to leverage that stuff by sending it \"audio\" that's actually just arbitrary time-series data rather than PCM of sound waves.\n \nreply",
      "There are some recent foundation models pre-trained on time-series data. For example TimesFM from Google. Of course, it's not directly built for classification, and it's meant for univariate datasets, so it would take some work to adapt it to these problem domains.\n \nreply",
      "I don't want to sound too dismissive of someone's hard work but I was kind of hoping for something more sophisticated than showing an LLM the image of a plot.  Using the article's example, I would be interested in understanding causes (or even just correlations) of near falls - is it old people, or people who didn't take their vitamins, or people who recently had an illness, etc.?  What's the best way of discovering these that isn't me slicing the data by X and looking at the plot.\n \nreply",
      "The fact that you can show an LLM an image of a plot and it'll give you a good-enough-ish classification I think is the interesting part.  It really is just prompt engineering all the way down...\n \nreply",

      "Even early piratical man - ranging from the seafaring Athenians to Han Chinese - who developed extensive seafaring capabilities utilized these materials in peace and in war. Thus, the Chinese idiom \"turning war into jade and silk\" is a means of communication with the gates of heaven.\n \nreply",
      "Studied ancient Chinese history but not a silk expert, here's my 2c.Critical background is that silk takes a lot of labour to prepare. First you must have the right kind of insects (various species of moth in the larval stage are commonly known as \"silkworm\"), then you must have the right kind of trees to feed them (commonly mulberries), then you add a lot of labour for capture, harvesting, spinning, dyeing, weaving. In modern times I have only really seen it prepared commercial scale in Jiangsu province (near Xuzhou). If you head too far north the insects probably suffer from the cold, and if you head too far south any artificial farming monoculture is probably readily outcompeted by other flowering plants and predatory insects which are more suited to the tropics (on account of higher moisture, food availability and temperature).Relative to existing fabrics such as hemp, silk has at least in other contexts been of value militarily because of its relative strength to weight ratio and dense weave when applied to important tasks such as resisting arrows, although I'm uncertain if this use had emerged yet. Any military use would tend to reinforce a cultural link between life and death owing to its spatiotemporal proximity to mortality events.The fact that it is soft and labour-intensive (expensive / in short supply) means it was probably reserved for the wealthier or higher ranking figures.Although the paper doesn't state it clearly, it actually deals with the archaeological findings of a non-Han Chinese civilization in the area of Sichuan which was illiterate and was based around what appeared to be a bird and tree cult (the Shu kingdom of the Sichuan basin[1]). It is therefore possible that a kind of soft, reflective-refractive, feather-like, readily dyed textile with a fine weave may have contributed to some sort of ritual purpose in line with these beliefs. Later this civilization was destroyed by the Han Chinese.The wicking properties of silk are fair (I was unable to find a quantitative reference) as was the major early textile of hemp (which is also tough and therefore long-lasting) which is significant as we know that Sichuan in the Shu kingdom period was a vast, tropical inland basin criss-crossed by regularly flooding rivers descending from the Himalayas, thickly forested and with crocodiles, elephants, rhinos, giant cats, colourful birds, etc. Both silk and hemp textiles would help to cool anyone wearing them, relative to other options (animal skins, etc.). Furthermore, in the absence of modern medicine, fine-weave capable wicking fabrics would assist with resisting potentially lethal bacterial and fungal infections in the tropical environment and may therefore have been used as wound dressings or undergarments.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(kingdom)\n \nreply",
      "> Relative to existing fabrics such as hemp, silk has at least in other contexts been of value militarily because of its relative strength to weight ratioSilk's just easier in general. Unlike vegetable fibers, silk can be reeled to yarn/thread directly. With cotton (or wool), there are about 4-6 other processes before you can even get to spinning. Hemp's worse still, I think there's a retting process in there like with linen.Or perhaps, it's more true that the labor-intensive portions are up front... you're feeding the dumb little worms up to 4 times a day early on, transferring them off of the eaten leaves (so as to avoid disease), and this only lightens up to twice a day later in the lifecycle. And this isn't tapping out a little pinch of food like for a goldfish bowl, they'll often do 10,000 worms at a time just to have some modest quantity of fiber (perhaps enough for 5 or 6 yards of fabric). This ends up being like 60+ lbs of mulberry leaves there at the end.All told though, I'd much rather raise the worms than sit there for six months trying to card cotton by hand.\n \nreply",
      "A woman in my local spinning and weaving club took up silk worms as a hobby, spent about 6 months from beginning to end and wound up (lol) with a ~ square foot patch to hang on the wall. Pretty impressive conversion from tree leaves to silk when you think about it.\n \nreply",
      "Me and my kids are still trying to figure out how to scale it up. We thought we had the right sort of mulberries... first batch starved. Then we tried Samia instead of Bombyx, but every single package would arrive damaged and empty. We've got mulberry seeds going, and we're getting some cuttings for this spring. Even then, you need something like 250+ cocoons for an ounce of silk, so we're not expecting much at first.\n \nreply",
      "\"Illiterate\" is a weird way to say \"oral culture\". The former is far more prejorative than the latter. It's also more accurate, since \"illiteracy\" refers to the absence of literacy where literacy is an actual option.Ironically enough, oral cultures show evidence of far longer memory capabilities than written cultures.\n \nreply",
      "That may be one of the more absurd \"noble savage\"-type claims ever made.\n \nreply",
      "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/australian-stories...How many cultures that adopted written languages have any 10,000 year old stories which happen to be true, exactly?\n \nreply",
      "Considering the earliest evidence of written language is only about 5,000 years old? None.Are you claiming that if the Aboriginals had written this down, they'd have forgotten by now?\n \nreply",
      "Wasn't there just an article that demonstrated writing from 7,000 years ago?My point was that using prejorative language against oral traditions is inappopriate considering the supposed superiority of \"literate\" cultures is yet to be demonstrated.*Considering how little regard we have for what was written 5,000 years ago in terms of valuing it for any historical accuracy whatsoever, or how much of that 5,000 year old narrative was available to us just 100-200 years, it is frankly baffling that I have to defend the idea that there might be something to a different form of social memory that manually encoded 10,000 years of history generation by generation.Is it really such a thought crime as \"noble savage\"-ism to point out that there is a difference between losing knowledge for thousands of years before then regaining it later (to hold in fairly contemptuous disbelief) and remembering it for the entire timespan?*EDIT: Perhaps a better way to say this: the ultimate inferiority of oral traditions is complicated by evidence to its contrary. I don't mean to claim that there are no advantages to written traditions, only that assigning zero advantages to oral traditions is not only arrogant, it is contradicted by the evidence available to use.\n \nreply"

From there, you have to think about what transformations you need to apply to your current state to get it to the desired state.Contrast this with game rulebooks.  There is a clear commonality: situations where none of the players know any of the rules.  Therefore, the rulebook can easily be written assuming no knowledge of the current rules of the game.  Players that know the rules of the game can either a) go make everyone coffee and avoid polluting the learning phase with information that stretches the patience of the folks reading the rulebook; or b) claim to the players that don't know the rules that the rulebook is useless and they can do a much better job explaining all the nuances much better than the person that designed the game.\n \nreply",

      "I feel like this is a mistake. Pat's strategy is aggressive but what the company needs.Intel's stock is jumping at this announcement, but I look at it as a bad signal for Intel 18a. If 18a was looking to be a smash hit then I don't think Pat gets retired. If 18a is a success then it is an even more short-sighted decision by the board.What this likely means is two-fold:1. Intel 18a is being delayed further and/or there are significant issues that will hamstring performance.2. Pat is/was unwilling to split the foundry and design business / be part of a M&A but the board wants to do one or the other.If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD. The US Govt would probably co-sign on it for national security concerns overriding the fact that it creates an absolute monopoly on x86 processors. The moat of the two companies together would give the new combined company plenty of time to ramp up their fabs.\n \nreply",
      ">> If 18a is not ready I think the best case scenario for Intel is a merger with AMD.Aside from the x86 monopoly that would create, I don't think Intel has much of value to AMD at this point other than the fabs (which aren't delivering). IMHO if Intel is failing, let them fail and others will buy the pieces in bankruptcy. This would probably benefit several other companies that could use 22nm and up fab capacity and someone could even pick up the x86 and graphics businesses.BTW I think at this point the graphics business is more valuable.

Then, how would you define cycles or spawning of the same task multiple times as a node-edge relation? It becomes extremely inconvenient and just gets in your way. The reason I built Flow is exactly because I previously relied on a predefined node-edge system which I also built (https://docs.lmnr.ai/pipeline/introduction).Also it impossible to do MapReduce like operations on node-edge without inventing some special node for handling that stuff.Idea about comparing LangGraph and Flow is really good and I will work on that asap!

      "Growing up in Nairobi, it took only a 20-minute ride to visit the vast coffee farms in areas like Kiambu, Limuru, and others nearby areas. These farms were located less than 10 kilometers from the city center, many of them close to the edge of the Aberdare mountain ranges. In the mid-1990s, when I was in primary school, we were taught that Kenya was a leader in coffee and tea production, and I used to consume coffee almost daily.\nThen, all of a sudden, it seemed like one scandal after another emerged\u2014farmers were not being paid, and the industry became overrun by brokers and middlemen. This meant local farmers were cut off from selling their coffee at competitive market rates and instead had to deal with corrupt government officials and brokers.\nSo, what did the farmers do? Most abandoned coffee farming and converted their farms into prime real estate. Remember, these farms were near the mountain slopes, making the land highly valuable. These new houses became popular with the UN and foreign nationals from Europe and the US, who sought refuge from Nairobi\u2019s \u201cheat.\u201d\nAs a result, more coffee farms were converted into real estate, and today these areas feature some of the most expensive properties in Kenya.

A few years ago, my girlfriend and I started a small coffee shop in Hanoi as a fun side project, and I was struck by the parallels between Vietnam's coffee history and the issues you outline here about Kenya.Vietnam, like Kenya, emerged from a coffee industry shaped by colonial-era inequities. Yet through reforms, robust state support for smallholder farmers, and a focus on infrastructure, Vietnam has positioned itself as a global coffee powerhouse. While the initial focus on robusta was quantity-driven, there\u2019s now a shift toward quality, which is helping Vietnamese coffee expand into new markets.Kenya\u2019s situation feels similar yet distinct. It has an unparalleled coffee heritage, and with thoughtful reforms\u2014empowering smallholders, encouraging direct trade, and finding the right balance between quality and disease-resistant hybrids\u2014it could reclaim its standing on the global stage.The article beautifully captures the systemic challenges and the hope for transformation.

      "One of my favorite series in the last few years. The tech side of things are believable enough (at least compared to the usual handwavy nature of sci-fi books) and now I understand why, as it seems Wells has a history in IT!I'm struggling to not gush about this book and trying to avoid spoilers, but if you like a good sci-fi action/adventure book with a strong lean towards a journey of self discover it's really worth a read.\n \nreply",
      "I echo this. If you liked murderbot, you might also like the Battleship Chronicles series by L. Claire (1), and ofcourse, the Imperial Radh series by Ann Leickie (2), and bobiverse, mentioned below, by Dennis Taylor (3), among others..(1) https://www.goodreads.com/series/391892-the-battleship-chron...(2) https://www.goodreads.com/series/113751-imperial-radch(3) https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse\n \nreply",
      "I read the first three books of the Imperial Radh (Ancillary Justice) series and for all of the love they get online I found them rather dull.  There's this fairly dramatic collapse of a galaxy spanning empire happening in the background while the protagonist frets over the level of offense she might cause at the tea party if she chooses to wear the more scandalous gloves.  The last book gets a bit more into the fractured psyche of the ruler, but even that gets shoved in the background far more than you would expect so the protagonist can worry about how she might hurt the feelings of the local planetary governor if she doesn't show up for his garden party.The protagonist is basically a disconnected Borg drone, although in their universe the drones are left with a bit more autonomy than the Star Trek equivalents, but because the protagonist is disconnected it doesn't matter nearly as much as you would expect.If you're interested in a big space opera about an empire falling apart I found the Collapsing Empire series by John Scalzi to be much more engaging.\n \nreply",
      "> the drones are left with a bit more autonomy than the Star Trek equivalentsI'm not sure I would describe it as more autonomy. The central ship computer was absolutly dominant within the hive mind, and had control over the ancillaries at all time.It's more like personalities of the ancillaries feed back into the hive mind at a somewhat subconscious level, and had quite a bit of impact on the overall personality.",
      "I quite liked the focus on minutiae while the bigger events were happening in the background. The third book even discussed it - we live or die today after this battle, but if we live then we still need to do the staff rota. It gave a little sense of realism that made the larger events more relatable.\n \nreply",
      "As a matter of taste, fair enough.But having recently read about all etiquette concerns of the Japanese admirals doing their life or death struggles during WWII, it hardly seems unrealistic.For a lot of people, seeing people navigate multiple military/social/political spheres is part of the appeal of imperial fiction.\n \nreply",
      "Definitely don't read the most recent one, Translation Space.  It's some very bad \"I like you but I don't know how to say it!\" YA-vein tropes and the climactic scene is, essentially, people walking around a circular hallway a couple times.It was so bad it caused me to re-read the original three, and I realized that only the first was one was any good.\n \nreply",
      "> the climactic scene is, essentially, people walking around a circular hallway a couple timesI feel like once you decide you don't like something, it's very easy to get reductionist about it in a way that makes it sound stupid or trite even if the reductionist statement is true. This summary to me is a quintessential example.I liked the book alright, but certainly not enough to get into a debate about it. If you liked Leckie's other work, you'll probably find something to like here too, no matter your feelings on hallways. But maybe not!\n \nreply",
      "Translation Space was not an interesting book to me, where I remember sincerely enjoying the first three.\n \nreply",
      "This is pretty amusing but true. I enjoyed the series for its quirks (unable to detect many character genders) but it\u2019s very young adulty with focus on social things and stuff. I think the concept of non-human-minds is better explored by Linda Nagata\u2019s series. You can kind of start in the middle with Edges and go with that.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "Murder is in the air. Everywhere I turn, I see images of a robot killing machine. Then I remind myself where I actually am: in a library lecture room on a college campus in East Texas. The air is a little musty with the smell of old books, and a middle-aged woman with wavy gray-brown hair bows her head as she takes the podium. She might appear a kindly librarian or a cat lady (confirmed), but her mind is a capacious galaxy of starships, flying bipeds, and ancient witches. She is Martha Wells, creator of Murderbot.Hearing a name like that, you\u2019d be forgiven for running for your life. But the thing about Murderbot\u2014the thing that makes it one of the most beloved, iconic characters in modern-day science fiction\u2014is just that: It\u2019s not what it seems. For all its hugeness and energy-weaponized body armor, Murderbot is a softie. It\u2019s socially awkward and appreciates sarcasm. Not only does it detest murdering, it wants to save human lives, and often does (at least when it\u2019s not binge-watching i"
