Make these the chapters. Then dive into each topic and figure out what you want to say about the topic. Usually 3-4 main points per chapter. These come out to be your subheadings. Order the chapters from beginner-to-advanced concepts or in a way that makes sense for the book you're writing.

      "This seems kind of like inventing a QWERTY alternative.  The best thing about QWERTY is that its ubiquitous and good enough, not that it's optimal.Although in the case of chromatone, I don't see any arguments made about technical improvements.  Instead of spelling note names with letters, we have colors.  Why is this better?  This some argument about the visible spectrum mapping.  But like, how is that useful?  I can tell a group of working musicians \"1-4-2-5 in E minor\", and we'd probably be able to play something moderately coherent based on that.  How do I do that in Chromatone?  What's the advantage?Most people (aside from those with perfect pitch) experience pitch relatively.  Things like intervals or scale degree given a tonic.  Maybe there's something interesting one could do mapping colors to something in this domain, a la solfege, like a minor 9 chord becomes green or something.  I'm still not totally  sure what the point would be.  Maybe you could read a chart quicker.But like, what's the problem in traditional notation/theory that we're trying to solve here?\n \nreply",

F major and F minor triads are green chords. E minor and E major triads are green chords, etc.This is a scheme that Tom Glazebrook calls \"metaharmony\", and he uses it in the context of studying the Barry Harris approach to Jazz, but it's actually isomorphic to Erno Lendvai's \"Axis Theory\" analysis of the music of Bela Bartok.

      "I've been using parametric CAD (Pro/E / Creo, Solidworks, and Onshape) for 30+ years. Automatically adding sketch constraints is nothing new. Just about any 2D sketching tool out there will have some sort of snapping and/or auto-constraint-adding system. What's often more frustrating is fixing things when they get accidentally over-constrained. Solidworks tries to help with this in the form of cycling through what it thinks are the most likely constraints to remove and then re-solving the sketch. It's OK, but that sort of tool could be better.A number of popular CAD systems use the D-Cubed 2D sketch constraint solver [0]. Siemens owns this and the Parasolid kernel, along with NX. All have been in constant development since the 80's. I really question what major new problems a startup is going to fix in 2D sketching constraints. I'm sure there a bunch of small quality of life things which may be out there, but most of the hard issues are more 3D or spline related, not finding things which could be tangent or equal.Probably the biggest paradigm shift with constraints that still hasn't really taken off is what Siemens is doing with SolidEdge. It allows for defining the 3D equivalent of constraints between surfaces, holes, edges, etc. and then using direct modeling techniques to modify solids. Perhaps adding more intelligence to that approach would make direct modeling more popular.Onshape has innovated in the way that it's brought Google Docs-like collaboration and GITHub like versioning, branching and merging to parametric CAD. Nothing else has these capabilities at the moment. To me that has been one of the most innovative changes in the mechanical CAD industry.Onshape also has FeatureScript, which is the programming language which describes all the parametric features. Right now, none of the LLMs know FeatureScript well enough to be the least bit useful. They hallucinate wildly. I'd be very happy to have a Copilot for FeatureScript.[0] https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/plm-components/d-cubed/\n \nreply",

It's OK, but that sort of tool could be better.I agree it could be better.  The behavior with under-constrained sketches depends on D-Cubed's DCM, and I seem to recall they were rather floppy.  It seems kind of ridiculous to make users jump through the hoops of making sketches fully constrained once they've added the constraints they care about.\n \nreply",

      "In Fusion 360, you can drag underconstrained parts of the sketch around with the mouse. So the \u201cdegree of freedom\u201d is still specified, but by accidental placement of how you drew the sketch. Fully-constrained sketches show a black outline and can\u2019t be changed without explicitly editing a constraint or dimension.For a quick example, see slide 10 in https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TiVoKF7mLlF360Oxy8hN... This is just a quick doc I made to show a friend how to use Fusion 360.\n \nreply",
      "To add to delhanty's reply, a \"degree of freedom\" can be thought of as a dimension of the drawing that can be changed or \"stretched\" or moved without violating a constraint (this is slightly inaccurate, but it's a good start). In a CAD program, a fully constrained drawing can't be freely stretched or dragged around; the program won't let you and the drawing will feel \"rigid\".It's very intuitive if you play around with a CAD program for a bit. There is a free (GPLv3) 2D and 3D CAD program called Solvespace (https://solvespace.com/) that is probably easiest one to obtain and learn. There are detailed tutorials on the website, and you could probably download it and finish the first tutorial in an hour.\n \nreply",
      "\"fully constrained\" means that there are no degrees of freedom left so that there are only a finite number of valid solutions, which are then consequently disconnected in the space of possible solutions.DCM then chooses one valid solution that it believes is \"close\" to initial supplied positions/directions/radii etc for the geometry.\n \nreply",
      "Your experience, I do not doubt. However, I believe you misrepresent what the authors are claiming. They do not claim that constraints are new, rather that setting all the constraints manually can be tedious, and tools that intelligently select sets of constraint options can be useful at the practical level.\n \nreply",

It closed in 2013, creating a time capsule of everyday life and consumption patterns over a span of 56 years. But Puente Hills is also a time capsule of landfill engineering itself. In 1976, right in the middle of its lifespan, sweeping federal regulations changed how we deal with solid waste forever.You probably don\u2019t think too much about where your trash goes, and that\u2019s kind of the whole point of the solid waste industry: to make sure you have the ability to throw something away w"

      "I only skimmed but I don\u2019t find this philosophy particularly interesting.The implication here is that everyone has one best place, but in reality there are many local maximums.  The opportunity cost of traversing a valley for a slightly higher maximum may not be worth it.The post also conflates employment with happiness.  Not having a paying job is a valid life choice.  Stay at home parent is a completely valid niche.Picking a job or career based on the free time it allows to pursue hobbies is also valid.None of this is easy and the post doesn\u2019t seem to provide any insight into finding a good fit.The idea that we have one \u201cbest\u201d fit is the self-help equivalent of \u201cperfect is the enemy of good\u201d.\n \nreply",
      "I'm not sure it conflates the niches with employment. Many of the examples given are specifically non-paying niches. (Starting with breakup-whisperer).Indeed for some percentage of people, employment is not fulfilling or satisfying. They turn to other activities to create significance in their lives. (Open Source software is pretty much built on this concept.)That said, I suspect the basic premise (everyone has a unique niche) is flawed. It's more likely that everyone has the opportunity to add value to society, and that value comes in various ever-creative forms. Many choose not to take that opportunity, and hypothetically we're worse off for that, but life pretty much still goes on.\n \nreply",

It\u2019s that everyone\u2019s key has a bit of give, enough to fit the locks available.

I think that is a good approach> The post also conflates employment with happiness.The article doesn't talk solely about traditional employment but has a broader definition of niche.> And that\u2019s just thinking of niches in the dumbest sense possible, which is \u201cthings you can do in exchange for money.\u201dLater:> When I was thirteen, I got promoted to moderator of the \u201cFlaming Chickens\u201d forum of a Yu-Gi-Oh! message board, which is where people were allowed to \u201cflame\u201d things that they hated (stepdads, math class, low-quality English dubs of Yu-Gi-Oh! episodes). I was so excited because it meant I meant something. Was the job pointless? Yes. Was it not a \u201cjob\u201d at all in the sense that it paid nothing? Yes. Did the forum eventually die because of an infidelity scandal inside the polycule of people who ran the message board? Also yes.

      "I'm a novice at machine learning, but Open AI made a python library for reinforcement learning in video games, and a fork of it is still actively maintained [1]. It's been a few years, but I remember being able to get it up and running in a day or two (maybe a weekend). It used the Retroarch emulator, which is compatible with a huge number of emulators and consoles.https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/GymnasiumThere also SethBling's excellent video on YouTube about machine learning specifically with Super Mario World:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44I encourage you to give it a try! I feel that video games are a bit underrated by current AI buzz, I think there's lots of potential for a machine to learn a skill through playing a game. And lots of potential for a game being selected or even created with the goal of teaching a specific skill. However at that point maybe it's better to forego the audio and visuals and speak to the machine in text or with pure data.On the other hand, I have seen a video about convolutional neural networks that feed on each pixel of an image. So perhaps training with sound data, or with the pixels of a spectrogram, could have some positive results. And certainly I would be amused to see a game played in time with music, or possibly even dancing with a songs melody, harmony, and story as well.Anything that's ever been created by humans, existed first in the imagination of a human brain. And you've got one of those. A mental vision pursued and brought from the mind into physical reality is a beautiful thing, a gift for all of humanity in my eyes. I think it's quite worthwhile.

Surprisingly, it is slightly older than Org-mode \u2013 although it now works great with Org files \u2013 and is still actively maintained by the author.After giving it a try, I now feel that I prefer it\u2019s simplicity over newer systems like Org Roam and Denote, while having some similarities to e.g. Deft (like fulltext as-you-type search).It also offers some unique features of its own, like \u201ccomefrom links\u201d as opposed to conventional \u201cgoto links\u201d, and that most Howm links are actually just syntactic sugar for searches.The submitted link [2] is to a third-party documentation of the project, which I found more useful than the official documentation to get started :)[1]: https://kaorahi.github.io/howm/[2]: https://github.com/Emacs101/howm-manual\n \nreply",

Japanese \u201cengineering\u201d at its best, so to speak.As Howm has become such an important part of my everyday digital life, I will certainly write my own blog article about it one day.

      "Avoid the temptation to add new fields to the bug database. Every month or so, somebody will come up with a great idea for a new field to put in the database. You get all kinds of clever ideas, for example, keeping track of the file where the bug was found; keeping track of what % of the time the bug is reproducible; keeping track of how many times the bug occurred; keeping track of which exact versions of which DLLs were installed on the machine where the bug happened. It\u2019s very important not to give in to these ideas. If you do, your new bug entry screen will end up with a thousand fields that you need to supply, and nobody will want to input bug reports any more.

      "I actually switched from Deft -> Xeft -> Howm as my main UI for searching and creating notes :).Xeft is indeed great, and I still keep it around for more involved searches (like \u201c+key1 -key2\u201d and \u201ckey1 NEAR key2\u201d).

I understand that it often serves as the scale factor for embedding the integers into the reals, but it's not totally clear to me what its role is in physical pontryagin duality/fourier transforms. It's some kind of volume in phase space, but where does that volume come from? For a constant like c, we have the narrative \"c is the ratio of unit lengths in time and space\", but I have not yet found a good narrative about the meaning of h that works for fourier transforms. Would appreciate any articles on the matter.\n \nreply",
      "I hope this answers your question. Let me preface this by saying that there are (probably) no satisfying answers for these questions, and that I'm not an expert. There is a classical limit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_limit> that will recover classical equations from quantum equations from the limit \u210f -> 0. Such a thing is a heuristic, which means that we just know some equations/models where it works, but have not discovered a general truth. There are also situations where you may take c -> +\u221e for example, and that would be called the non-relativistic limit. Why do we take these limits? Because when we did, the answer was not complete nonsense. We don't know what to make of them, i.e. we don't have complete theories. Also, what these limits mean is not a simple matter of calculus, they are not point-wise limits.In one such instance I've been studying for years, the WKB approximation, I've realized two things: 1) the approximations are not well understood and 2) the mathematics are quite complicated, but these points notwithstanding the equations are used in experiments. You can read the few-page introduction in \"Lectures on the Geometry of Quantization\" by Bates & Weinstein <https://math.berkeley.edu/~alanw/GofQ.pdf> to see some of this, in particular the subsection \"Quantization and the classical limit\". I'll just quote the relevant paragraph:> Although there remain some unsettled issues connected with the question, \u201cHow can\n\u210f become small?\u201d the answer is essentially the following. For any particular mechanical\nsystem, there are usually characteristic distances, masses, velocities, . . . from which a unit\nof action appropriate to the system can be derived, and the classical limit is applicable\nwhen \u210f divided by this unit is much less than 1.But remember, this is just one approach to the subject. Another heuristic is this: h has dimensions energy x time, which means it converts frequency into energy, e.g. E = hf. In the Fourier transform, the character is exp(2\u03c0ihx\u00b7\u03be), where \u03be is the frequency. The effect of h -> 0 would be to dampen high-energy waves. Irregularity comes from high frequencies (think of it like this: a sum of sines of large periods would not have many kinks.) When you \"iron out\" the irregularity of the quantum solution, you end up with a classical one.Again disclaimer: not a physicist, nor an expert.\n \nreply",
      "Like the speed of light in vacuum provides a natural unit for velocity, i.e. for the ratio between length and time, Planck's constant (computed by him in 1899, before any quantum theory, because it is a consequence of the laws of blackbody radiation) provides a natural unit for angular momentum, i.e. for the ratio between kinetic energy and frequency (a.k.a. angular velocity).(Many books claim that Planck's constant is a quantum of \"action\". This is extremely wrong, because action is not a quantized physical quantity, so it cannot have quanta, and moreover the ratio between energy and frequency is not an action, but an angular momentum. This ridiculous mistake is caused by the failure to understand that the unit of plane angle is a base unit that cannot be derived from any of the units of the other physical quantities and forgetting to write the plane angle in the dimensional relationships between physical quantities leads to very serious errors. Angular momentum is the ratio between action and plane angle, while energy is the ratio between action and time and the linear momentum is the ratio between action and length. Frequency is not the inverse of time, but the ratio between plane angle and time, as the old name of \"Hertz\", i.e. \"cycles per second\" was making this obvious.)Dividing or multiplying by combinations of Planck's constant with the speed of light and the elementary charge only changes the system of units, between the traditional units and natural units. There are several variants of \"natural\" systems of units and the difference between using them and using SI is that when using natural systems of units there are much less \"universal\" constants in the relationships between physical quantities.Like electric charge, angular momentum is one of the quantities that are discrete, not continuous (though angular momentum is not necessarily discrete like electric charge; depending on the physical system it may be either discrete or continuous).Like the elementary charge is the quantum of electric charge (when all quarks are bound in hadrons), a half of Planck's constant is the quantum of angular momentum (there are multiple possible definitions of the angular momentum, depending on the unit chosen for plane angle, which lead to multiple possible numeric values for Planck's constant).The importance of the c, e and h constants is due to them being respectively the limit value for velocity and the quanta of two fundamental discrete quantities (electric charge and angular momentum), which makes them appear in many relationships between physical quantities, unless the system of units is changed to a \"natural\" system of units, when the \"universal\" constants become \"1\", so they disappear from the formulae.When a natural system of units is not used in quantum mechanics, then all the equations that contain both energy or momentum and time or length, like the equation of Schroedinger, will contain Planck's constant, possibly combined with other universal constants. This will have as a consequence the appearance of those constants also in the expressions that give the pairs of quantities related by Fourier transforms.\n \nreply"

      "5MB of 1965 disk storage, as the article helpfully points out, stores 5 million (EBCDIC) characters of text.5MB of 2024 storage, stores 5 million (ASCII) or as little as 1.25 million (UTF-8) characters of text.There's no inflation to adjust here. There are still people programming microcontrollers with 1KiB or 512 bytes of RAM, 4KiB EEPROM, and maybe 1MB Flash.  Those computers can do about the same things which 1965 computers with the same specs can do, just  20-100 times faster.  Just because we don't use an AVR to add up Olympic scores, doesn't mean we couldn't.The ones with five orders of magnitude more resources do a lot more. Some of it is squandered, when we can afford to do that, but in applications like AAA gaming or simulation, not so much.  They operate near-optimally, just much faster, and doing a great deal more than was possible at the time.\n \nreply",
      "The editor I'm using today updates itself from a global network of interconnected computers, using strong cryptography to ensure no one's tampered with it. It can download plugins from that same inter-net and has a sandbox that keeps malicious code from taking over the rest of its process space or accessing the filesystem. Some of those plugins make their own encrypted connections to distant computers. It displays its user interface on a truecolor screen across 2 2560x1440 monitors. It understands a huge number of programming languages and has advanced reformatting, error checking, syntax highlighting, search, building, testing, and reference-finding capabilities that can easily handle version controlled codebases with gigabytes of code. Because all its pointers are twice the size of those in older systems, I can open individual files many gigabytes in size.Yeah, it's bigger than Emacs on a PDP-11. It does a whole lot more than Pico does, too.\n \nreply"

      "I quite like that. Simple and with beautiful art. Congratulations\n \nreply",
      "So fun, thanks for sharing! I'm feeling some nostalgia. The first game I ever made was also an ant defense game. You use a magnifying glass to protect your tomato at a picnic. As you get to later levels, the ants get bigger and the sun starts to set, so you have to buy upgrades.I wrote it in Java in high school back in 2006. The site I hosted it on in high school is no longer live. I put it on Replit a few years back, but I no longer have access to the account, so I had to fork the repl to play it again. Things change. Hold on to your code. It's fun to revisit old programs!If you want to give it a try: https://replit.com/@PatrickAtReplit/Ant-Killer-Game.\n \nreply",
      "Congratulations on the launch! Please, consider putting up a screenshot at the top of the README. When I see visual products such as games or GUIs showcased in HN, having a good screenshot or two is often the deciding factor in whether I try it or not. And probably I am not the only one. A picture is worth a thousand words.\n \nreply",
      "Oh, it's the same with me! I'll add a screenshot whenever I'm free.\n \nreply",
      "That was much more fun than I expected and the game is really well-drawn and snappy. I was doing so well until the really fast black ants started showing up.\n \nreply",
      "This a great start. A level progression system would make it a full fledged game. You could introduces walls to control the direction/flow of ants. The walls would change per level. Also, some kind of penalty for spamming might help. Right now I can use multiple fingers to press all over the map without much thought.\n \nreply",
      "Fun game! Resizing the browser window after it starts breaks the game though. If you you resize it so the princess is off the screen, you can't lose :)\n \nreply",
      "Yeah I've noticed when I was writing codes! But I intended the game to be primarily played on a mobile device, so didn't bother to fix it.\n \nreply",
      "Happens also on mobile. Just rotate e.g. from portrait to landscape during gameplay.\n \nreply",
      "Very nice! I think it would be nice if the ants sped up gradually instead of making it drastically faster after a while\n \nreply"

      "Its interesting that Rojava wasn't mentioned here. After driving out Islamic State, they founded their own country in north east Syria, not widely internationally recognised yet but functioning much better than the rest of Syria.They are still a developing country and by no means wealthy, but the average income in this area is double what it is in the rest of the country.Their economy is built almost entirely on cooperatives.

      "If:1 - Cooperatives excite you and2 - You use social mediayou might want to look at the social.coop Mastodon instance (or cosocial.ca if you're Canadian).Not only has the community on both those sites been a breath of total fresh air for me, I am not worried about the server I'm on having decide between disappearing and selling ads, and I feel like I'm partaking in a social enterprise.Just recently social.coop had an open vote on how to donate some of our surplus to the open software we use and organizations that promote cooperation. It's been so nice to see and be apart of.\n \nreply",
      "That's neat! How is it funded?\n \nreply",
      "By the members; we all pay a tiny bit into the co-op each month. Most people pay 1 USD or GBP per month, if you use some of the other services we offer through organizational memberships in other co-ops (ie. we're a member of meet.coop for video calls, May First Co-op for Nextcloud and email and what not, etc.) then some people pay a bit more (normally no more than 3 to 5 USD or GBP).\n \nreply",

      "Why aren\u2019t there more of these if they work well?\n \nreply",
      "The paradox of worker-coops is that workers capable of successfully running businesses together are also capable of running businesses independently, so there's no need to form a co-op. It's those incapable of running a business individually or collectively that then form co-ops. Mondragon is the exception, not the rule.\n \nreply",
      "Put another way: Singers who aren't good enough to make it on their own form large idol groups (eg: AKB 48) to sell themselves, while those who are become stars on their own or form small bands with others of similar success.Or to put it another way: Ground meat is great, but the components thereof by themselves are generally regarded as waste.\n \nreply"
