The macOS version of OpenSSH stores all of its configuration files, both system-wide and per-account, in the data volume. Therefore, the usually configured authentication methods and shell access are not available during this time. However, when Remote Login is enabled, it is possible to perform password authentication using SSH even in this situation. This can be used to unlock the data volume remotely over the network. However, it does not immediately permit an SSH session.

      "Eh, they certainly weren't celebrities in the same way, that would only be possible with modern broadcast media. But people like the pope, kings, and dukes would be pretty close. I would expect the average medieval peasant would know who the pope (or popes, depending on the date) were, and at the least who their king was, as well as the relevant nobles for their village. And I wouldn't be surprised if they knew who the neighboring kings and nobles were. A peasant from the Iberian peninsula might not know who the king of Poland was, but they would likely know who the French king was and likely who was emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.And medieval people definitely built monuments to themselves. A great example is Battle Abbey [0]. The official reason it was built was as penance for William the conqueror killing so many English, but there is definitely a strong case to be made that building such a grand abbey was in 0art to signify the new Norman rule and to remind people of who was in charge. They weren't venerating the architect, but it was very clear to everyone who paid for the abbey and William remained very much linked to the structure. That would have been one of the most impressive buildings for a very large area, even it's ruins remain impressive nearly a millennium later. It's a religious building, but it was even at the time very much linked to a secular ruler (inasmuch as the rulers of the time were secular).[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Abbeyreply",

      "Nvidia's stake in Intel could have terrible consequences. First, it is in Nvidia's interest to kill Intel's Arc graphics, and that would be very bad because it is the only thing brighing GPU prices down for consumers. Second, the death of Intel graphics / Arc would be extremely bad for Linux, because Intel's approach to GPU drivers is the best for compatibility, wheras Nvidia is actively hostile to drivers on Linux. Third, Intel is the only company marketing consumer-grade graphics virtualization (SR-IOV), and the loss of that would make Nvidia's enterprise chips the only game in town, meaning the average consumer gets less performance, less flexibility, and less security on their computers.reply",
      "Conclusion: Buy AMD. Excellent Linux support with in-tree drivers. For 15 years! A bug is something which will be fixed.Nvidias GPUs are theoretically fast on initial benchmarks. But that\u2019s mostly optimization by others for Nvidia? That\u2019s it.Everything Nvidia has done is a pain.

The infamous bug:    This extension provides a    way for applications to discover when video\n    memory content has been lost, so that the application can re-populate\n    the video memory content as necessary.\n\nhttps://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_robustn...This extension will be soon ten years old. At least they intend to fix it? They just didn\u2019t in the past 9 years! Basically, video memory could be gone after Suspend/Resume, VT-Switch and so on. The good news is, after years someone figured that out and implemented a workaround. For X11 with GNOME:https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-Ubuntu-2025-SnRI hope in the meantime somebody implemented a patch for Wayland.What we need? Reliability. And Linux support.

I'm all for open-source in-tree drivers, but in practice, 15 years on, AMD is still buggy on Linux, whereas NVidia works well (not just on Linux but on FreeBSD too).> I don\u2019t judge whether implicit sync or explicit are better.Maybe you should.reply",
      "I've found the amdgpu Linux driver to be fairly buggy running dual monitors with my Radeon VII, and found things like the fTPM to be highly buggy on Threadripper 2k/x399 to the point that I had to add a dTPM. They never got things truly working properly with those more-niche products before they just.. kind of... stopped working on them. And of course ROCm is widely regarded to be a mess.On the other hand, my Steam Deck has been exceedingly stable.So I guess I would say: Buy AMD but understand that they don't have the resources to truly support all of their hardware on any platform, so they have to prioritize.reply",
      "> Excellent Linux support with in-tree drivers. For 15 years!Linux support has been excellent on AMD for less than 15 years though. It got really good around 10 years ago, not before.reply",
      "ATI/AMD open source linux support has been blowing hot and cold for over 25 years now.They were one of the first to actually support open source drivers, with the r128 and original radeon (r100) drivers. Then went radio silence for the next few years, though the community used that as a baseline to support the next few generations (r100 to r500).Then they reemerged with actually providing documentation for their Radeon HD series (r600 and r700), and some development resources but limited - and often at odds with the community-run equivalents at the time (lots of parallel development with things like the \"radeonhd\" driver and disagreements on how much they should rely on their \"atombios\" card firmware).That \"moderate\" level of involvement continued for years, releasing documentation and some initial code for the GCN cards, but it felt like beyond the initial code drops most of the continuing work was more community-run.Then only relatively recently (the last ~10 years) have they started putting actual engineering effort into things again, with AMDGPU and the majority of mesa changes now being paid for by AMD (or Valve, which is \"AMD by proxy\" really as you can guarantee every $ they spend on an engineer is $ less they pay to AMD).So hopefully that's a trend you can actually rely on now, but I've been watching too long to think that can't change on a dime.reply",
      ">  Basically, video memory could be gone after Suspend/Resume, VT-Switch and so on.This actually makes sense: for example, a new task has swapped out previous task's data, or host and guest are sharing the GPU and pushing each others data away.

So regardless of Cuda I decided Nvidia is not for me.However, doing research when buying a new pc, I've found that AMD kind of sucks too. ROCm isn't even supported on many of the systems i was looking into. Also, I've heard their Linux graphics drivers are poor.So basically I just rock a potato with Intel integrated graphics now. GPUs cost too much to deal with that nonsense.reply",

Touching on points like how religion plays a part in shaping the America of today and even how humans are worst at discerning faces today because we need to discern letters and words and dedicate brain power for that.There are so many interest studies mentioned there, one that really stuck with me is how Protestant-raised Americans will work harder for the next day after having (reasearch-led) incestuous thoughts  when compared to Catholics and Atheists.He explains how monogamy is to blame for a lot of our western views today, and how Mormon towns in Utah were affected by not having monogamy as the basis of society (women there tend to prefer to be 2nd wives of a better man rather being the only wife of a lower-ranking man).One of the wildest claims in there is the one that the north of Italy is more developed today because it was part of the Holy Roman Empire while the south wasn\u2019t. About a thousand years separate these and he finds effects still. Mostly in connection to the spread of read/write to the public being a core tenant of Protestantism.Anyway, this is not a summary of the book but instead a few points from it that really stuck with me after reading it. Fascinating stuffreply",
      "> One of the wildest claims in there is the one that the north of Italy is more developed today because it was part of the Holy Roman Empire while the south wasn\u2019t. About a thousand years separate these and he finds effects still.I would note that the north and south of Italy have very different geography and climate. Which can be upstream of all sorts of things, culturally. The geography of Italy's two halves support different types of economic activity; and the social realities of living within these different economies, naturally evolves into major differences in culture. (Compare/contrast: the differing cultures of coastal vs midwestern America. Now imagine that split with a few thousand more years for the divergence to take hold.)History happens once; but geography is always affecting a nation, all throughout its evolution. So if you're looking for reasons that two sub-populations within a country might have noticeable differences today, differing geography is going to be the \"horse\", while history is more of the \"zebra.\"That being said: geography can also constrain history.Southern Italy is almost entirely coastline, in a part of the world where, for much of the last ~2000 years, everyone was constantly invading everyone else by sea. Northern Italy was relatively-more immune to amphibious assault, as its capitals could be situated more inland. (Rome itself \u2014 the exception that proves the rule \u2014 was located in south Italy, but was defended from amphibious assault mostly by the Roman Empire's huge naval home-fleet being docked to the southern-Italian coast; not by anything inherent to its location. Once the Roman Empire itself went away, big rich cities in southern Italy suddenly became juicy targets for conquest and/or sacking.)reply",
      "Also that Italy has only been a single country for a couple hundred years [0], so there will obviously still be regional differences.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Italyreply",

Why is Argentina, the country with nuclear technology that build our research/medical reactor in the South when we don't have that technology?It is completely arbitrary, political and divisive.

It\u2019s been an excellent upgrade over our old, simple whiteboard \u2014 tldraw is a fantastic project.I'm also the CEO of Blindside Networks, the commercial company behind BigBlueButton. We have growing by the traditional open source business model: we offer hosting, engineering services for acceleration of features, and support contracts.I understand the motive behind tldraw's change of license.  Open source projects often get asked two contradictory questions:\n 1. Can I use your work for free?\n 2. Can you guarantee that you\u2019ll be around in 5 years?You can\u2019t answer (1) without a solid plan for (2). Licensing changes are one way projects try to answer both of these questions.We are no stranger to license changes, we recently rewrote the entire back-end of BigBlueButton and moved away from mongoDB to PostgreSQL + Hasura.For us, moving to tldraw 4.0 would mean:- As Blindside (the company): buying a commercial license \u2014 that\u2019s straightforward as we are also a commercial company.\n- As BigBlueButton (the open source project): it would require every organization running BigBlueButton to obtain its own license key to tldraw.There are pros and cons here. We want a world-class whiteboard in tldraw based on a sustainable open source project, but we also want to keep BigBlueButton\u2019s community deployment model simple.Curious how others in the HN community have handled integrating source-available components into open source projects.

If on the other hand \"you\" refers to you individually or as a company, then the first can be answered with a resounding \"no\" and the second a solid \"maybe, that depends on how much you are willing to pay us for a 5 year support contract\" (though you should probably word it a bit differently when talking with potential clients).As far as working with source available components, suggestion one is to look for others int he community that you can cooperate with to maintain a fork, and option two, if you really can't get the community to support a fork, is to make it a plugin/optional component, preferably with an API so that other solutions can be integrated as options, or at least a fallback to the old version that was open source.reply",

The outer loop runs n times, where n is the length of the array. The inner loop runs through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The swapped flag is used to detect if any elements were swapped in the current pass, which would indicate that the array is already sorted and can be exited early.reply",

They're built for those, support x86, and are all great!It reads like you're saying for all Apple devices (which would include iOS), use these other things.(?) For iOS, are you trying to beat performance of other options? If so, it would be helpful to include comparison benchmarks.reply",

If you make it open source, embrace the ethos and build community, then your product or service will be stronger for it. If the big players clone your work, you get instant underdog credibility and notoriety.reply",

Honestly, I\u2019d be annoyed too and it might sound like an excuse, but our circumstance was quite unique, it was a difficult decision at that time being an open-source contributor myself.It\u2019s still free for the community, just that corporations need a license.

      "A few questions if the authors are around!> Is hardware agnostic and uses TCP/IP to communicate.So no RDMA?\nIt's very hard to make effective use of modern NVMe drives bandwidth over TCP/IP.> A logical shard is further split into five physical instances, one leader and four followers, in a typical distributed consensus setup. The distributed consensus engine is provided by a purpose-built Raft-like implementation, which we call LogsDBRaft-like, so not Raft, a custom algorithm?\nImplementing distributed consensus correctly from scratch is very hard - why not use some battle-tested implementations?> Read/write access to the block service is provided using a simple TCP API currently implemented by a Go process. This process is hardware agnostic and uses the Go standard library to read and write blocks to a conventional local file system. We originally planned to rewrite the Go process in C++, and possibly write to block devices directly, but the idiomatic Go implementation has proven performant enough for our needs so far.The document mentions it's designed to reach TB/s though. \nWhich means that for an IO intensive workload, one would end up wasting a lot of drive bandwidth, and require a huge number of nodes.Modern parallel filesystems can reach 80-90GB/s per node, using RDMA, DPDK etc.> This is in contrast to protocols like NFS, whereby each connection is very stateful, holding resources such as open files, locks, and so on.This is not true for NFSv3 and older, it tends to be stateless (no notion of open file).No mention of the way this was developed and tested - does it use some formal methods, simulator, chaos engineering etc?reply",

Maybe that's just a reflection of the time though, drives have gotten a lot faster since then.",
