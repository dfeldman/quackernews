      "> the longest post on my site, takes 92 KiB instead of 37 KiB. This amounts to an unnecessary 2.5x increase in load timeSure, if you ignore latency. In reality it's an unnecessary 0.001% increase in load time because that size increase isn't enough to matter vs the round trip time. And the time you save transmitting 55 fewer KiB is probably less than the time lost to decompression. :pWhile fun, I would expect this specific scenario to actually be worse for the user experience not better. Speed will be a complete wash and compatibility will be worse.\n \nreply",
      "That's certainly reasonable if you optimize only for loading time (and make certain assumptions about everybody's available data rate), but sometimes I really wish website (and more commonly app) authors wouldn't make that speed/data tradeoff so freely on my behalf, for me to find out after they've already pushed that extra data over my metered connection.The tragedy here is that while some people, such as the author of TFA, go to great lengths to get from about 100 to 50 kB, others don't think twice to send me literally tens of megabytes of images, when I just want to know when a restaurant is open \u2013 on roaming data.Resource awareness exists, but it's unfortunately very unevenly distributed.\n \nreply",

      "It\u2019s not just decompression time. They need to download the whole thing before decompression, whereas the browser can decompress and render HTML as it\u2019s streamed from the server. If the connection is interrupted you lose everything, instead of being able to read the part you\u2019ve downloaded.So, for any reasonable connection the difference doesn\u2019t matter; for actually gruesomely slow/unreliable connections where 50KB matters this is markedly worse. While a fun experiment, please don\u2019t do it on your site.\n \nreply",

      "Decent critique, but it mixes together two things: the design language, and UI papercuts showing a lack of attention to detail.Consider the current macOS Finder:https://a.qoid.us/20240907-finder.pngFinder's design is extremely similar to GNOME Files!  And so the inherent downsides of the design language are present in Finder too, such as it being harder to drag windows around or click to activate windows.But macOS does avoid most of the UI papercuts the author points out.  It's not perfect, but let's go through the list.- View Options: Finder has a similar-looking icon that does the same thing.  But in Finder, the little arrows on the right of an icon are always part of the same button as the icon itself.  Finder doesn't use split buttons in the way the author complains about.- Help: The macOS User Guide explains all the icons and what they do.  But you don't actually need to go that far, because macOS has a feature where if you click Help and start typing, it will show menu items (from any menu) that match what you typed.  In this case, if you start typing \"list\", it will show the \"as List\" menu item, which achieves what the author wants.  (I guess I should point out that macOS does have a menu bar at the top of the screen, and all the actions you can take by clicking icons can also be taken through the menu bar.)- Tooltips: Finder doesn't have tooltips for the locations on the left pane, only for the icons in the toolbar.  Even there they take a while to appear.- Navigation: I'd ding Finder here because there is no location bar at all (only an 'open by path' dialog that's kind of buried).  Even going to the parent directory is not exposed in a particularly obvious way.  Still, at least Finder doesn't have something that looks editable but isn't.- Scrolling: macOS has hidden scrollbars by default, but they stay at the right of the window.  They don't jump to the left like the author is complaining about.\n \nreply",
      "I don't use Gnome since the days of version 2, which was really nice and friendly. But I was impressed by how well the latest iteration works in a tablet.That's a great advantage, because it's the same UI as a desktop. Plus, they have made sure all core applications work well using a touch UI.\n \nreply",

      "These complaints aren't invalid, but I do wonder how many users actually get tripped up on these things. If you want a list view, clicking on the icon that looks like a list isn't a crazy thing to do. I agree the dropdown behaviour is a bit strange.Equally, it's accepted that a bunch of today's Gnome apps have title bars with controls inside them. I don't think it's that jarring that if you don't click on a control accurately and then start dragging the mouse, you're going to move the window.\n \nreply",
      "The sort of mental process the author related to find that list view was pretty much the same I went through, so at least there's two people. But, as they said and the author quoted, \"Our software is built to be usable by everyone. We care deeply about user experience.\"Though there are already TONS of critiques to GNOME (hell, even I have written some stuff about them here) and so much has been said about it that saying something else seems like a waste of time in my humble opinion. Its devs won't change their mind because they have a laser-sharp vision of what they want to achieve. Its users won't change their mind because they like it and feel at home using it. We the people that don't (or no longer) like it won't change our minds either because it can feel really strange, confusing and even limiting.It's been more than 10 years since they went to that route but they will do little to nothing about that because, as the author correctly asserted, \"it's also a project that's very vocal - opinionated, as the saying goes - about how to do things.\" So either you like the GNOME way of doing things or you just can go somewhere else. Which, again, it's a bit contradictory taking in account their \"Our software is built to be usable by everyone\" motto.\n \nreply",

      "Wow. Thank you for posting this.  I am fifty years old.  In 1989 my best friend, Geof Allen, and I spent an entire year planning to walk the AT after high school.  During long nights in my parents basement we literally mapped out every step by figuring out how many steps were in a mile, and then multiplying.  Life happened.  He walked the entire AT from Spring Mtn to Mt Kahdin.  I reluctantly followed my parents wishes and went off to college.Even in high school Geof was unlike anyone I ever knew.  He did not have the best life, but he always smiled.  When we were winter-camping together Geof knew how to make your frozen feet not-so-bad.  When we were lost deep in a cave in Newport, Virginia, Geof showed no signs of worry, while I openly panicked.After walking the AT Geof joined the Navy, and when a slot opened up he became a Blue Angel...not a pilot, but still a prestigious position with a flight suit as a uniform.  He married his high school sweetheart, and after the Navy, moved back home and became a police officer.I had totally lost contact with Geof, and was working in IT across the street from my local police department.  As I was walking to my car one afternoon I saw Geof standing in the parking lot.  We chatted and caught up a bit, and then lost contact again.The next time I heard Geof's name was years later.  He had committed suicide.  I almost want to say that he didn't have a choice.  You see, he had watched all of the other males and one female in his fathers bloodline be taken away by Huntington's Disease.  I found out later that Geof was in the early-stages, and it was easy to deduce that he needed to take action while he was still able.We were all from the same hometown.  I knew his Uncles and his Aunt, and watched what Huntington's did to them, and I was there the day his father committed suicide.I found Geof's picture on athikerpictures.com.  He is second from the left.  Blue pants and white shirt.  I am certain that he made life easier for the three hikers pictured with him.  His trail name was Alpha.  Alpha Geof Allen.\n \nreply",

I do however vividly recall the photo archive at Rusty's Hardtime Hollow just off the Blue Ridge Parkway section of the AT a few miles but was well worth the trip.Rusty had polaroids of hikers going way back, they lined the walls of every building, when he built new bunkhouses, he started new annual collections.  There were thousands of them.  Every night he would roll his truck down into the parking are blast James Brown and feed what he could to whatever he had or whatever hikers could bring.  Wood fired hot tub, sauna, huge garden, it was a paradise after almost a 1000 miles on foot.I hope the ATC was also able to recover Rusty's photos, because he had a real gold mine.  The few years after hiking when I lived in the area I would bring beverages and hot dogs for the hikers.  I lost touch with Rusty after I went west.  I was hiking recently in Maine and talking to another thruhiker who went through in the 2000 and she said the Hollow is gone now which would be a shame of his archive could not be recovered.\n \nreply",

Always fun to see people come together for stuff like this.They mention difficulty in trying to figure out names, dates, trail names, etc. I realized I'm so used to the ubiquitousness of social media and cell phones because my immediate thought was, \"Why did these people not put down their numbers?\"\n \nreply",

      "Wow! Never thought about it like this before:> Because Japanese text is read from right to left, the earliest viewers of The Great Wave would have likely read the print that way too, first encountering the boaters and then meeting the great claw of water about to swallow them. So instead of riding along with the gargantuan wave as you might in a left-to-right reading, they would face right into the massive wall of ocean.Reversed image from the article to demonstrate: https://artic-web.imgix.net/5c05c38c-1c80-446f-a3db-4b95b42e...\n \nreply",

On the other hand, more modern text (including what\u2019s more common now) is read left to right when written horizontally. There are some more variations on directionality.Nevertheless, the picture does look and convey a different impression when flipped.\n \nreply",

      "Seems a little unfair on Yetnikoff and Gottlieb. There are potentially a whole heap of songs and books that are _potentially_ better than both Hallelujah and A Confederacy of Dunces; but they are undiscovered, and most will remain that way. It seems unfair that the author of the piece, with super-duper hindsight and a firm hand on the survivor bias handle, picks two survivors and then ridicules the editor and reviewer who didn't see precisely what everybody else didn't see either. Seems a bit of a cheap shot.\n \nreply",

As they point out in the last paragraphs, many works of genius are probably lost because the stars don't align.\n \nreply",
      "I'm dealing with this right now. My wife was killed by a Russian tank in January while rescuing two wounded soldiers, and she left behind a whole trove of her writings. I've compiled everything into a book, and everyone who takes the time to read it agrees that what she wrote is amazing, moving, heartbreaking - but I cannot for love nor money get the damn thing published.Here's an example:=== May 26, 2023 20:33I worked in Dnipro last year in October and November as first responder for missile strikes (kamikaze drones weren\u2019t a big issue yet in Dnipro at that time, missiles were the main threat), and therefore any news and pictures of an attack there feel very personal to me. They\u2019re not just another headline about another strike to me, but bring back memories from the strikes that I responded to myself and the experiences I made.Coming from these experiences, let me remind you, or make you aware, that these attacks cause much more harm than what you see on the news pictures or that the numbers show of how many people died or are hospitalized or how many buildings got destroyed.For example, last year I rescued (\u2018found cowering on the ground\u2019 would be more fitting in this case actually) a young woman who was close-ish to a half collapsed and burning gas station that was hit by a missile. She had a wound from a piece of shrapnel on her hand, that was all. It wasn\u2019t serious, no bones, nerves, ligaments etc. were damaged, a case for a bandage as first aid and later a few stitches in the hospital. She didn\u2019t even have a serious concussion as far as I could tell on the spot, apparently, luckily, she was still far enough away from the impact for it to cause her any serious physical damage. But she was severely in shock, I mean psychological shock. She looked at me like\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to describe this but I\u2019ll never forget this look in her eyes\u2026 like in complete disbelief of what just happened or confusion about what happened, mixed with deep sadness, mixed with fear for her life. Something like this. She was traumatized, and the same applied to everybody who was there when it happened, no matter whether or not they had physical injuries.Another time we were searching a damaged building right next to a partially destroyed building (from a missile strike). It was basically still intact, 'only\u2019 blown out windows and smaller damage like that from the shockwave and from shrapnel /secondary shrapnel flying around, but no collapsed walls or other visible damage that would affect the building\u2019s structural integrity. \u201cSearching\u201d in this case means we had to check on every single person living there if they need medical help, and/or enter every single apartment, if necessary by force, to see if anybody is there who needs assistance. Everybody in this building was 'fine\u2019, there were no dead, no injured (beyond a few scratches or minor cuts from window glass), no unattended frightened children or elderly, nobody who would\u2019ve needed our help, aside from a bandaid or a piece of candy (for the kids) here and there. These people wouldn\u2019t show up in any statistics that you see on the news, they\u2019re the 'lucky\u2019 ones, but if you talk to them in person there\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also direct victims of this missile strike. - If you talk to people later who have experienced something like this, they\u2019ll tell you that their children are deadly afraid of all kinds of banging sounds and of the air raid alert sirens, they run to the hallway (if you don\u2019t have a basement, or one that can\u2019t be reached quickly, that\u2019s where you would go, away from the windows and outer parts of the building but some windowless hallway deeper inside preferably in a doorframe) if they sense the slightest sign of danger, or what they interpret as danger. Everybody gets paranoid of the sky, and people don\u2019t feel safe in their own homes, their own beds, anymore.Then there are of course the people who lose their homes because of these strikes, some of them might be unharmed themselves if they weren\u2019t home, but they\u2019ve lost everything.And that\u2019s only the people who are directly affected. Then you have all the secondary damage (or tertiary, or where are we now..) that comes from destroyed infrastructure. A strike might have been relatively far away from you, but you can\u2019t get to work anymore because your train can\u2019t drive (destroyed railroads), you don\u2019t have warm water to bathe your baby because the water boiler doesn\u2019t work without electricity (destroyed power stations, or lines), or you have no water at all anymore (destroyed water facilities, or pipes), or your grampa has a heart attack but it takes an eternity for the ambulance to arrive (destroyed hospitals or ambulances), or you can\u2019t go to work because nobody can take care of your kids anymore (destroyed kindergartens), and so on.And on top you have a whole neighborhood, city, a whole country, who, even if they\u2019ve never been near any missile strikes and aren\u2019t affected at all (yet), who live in constant fear that the next missile could have their name on it, or their family\u2019s or friend\u2019s. And the people who are grieving because they\u2019ve lost somebody in a missile strike. And the loss of buildings and cities that have a decades or centuries old history and have become part of the culture of a district or region. The list is endless, but you get the idea.Russia has launched _thousands_ of missiles on Ukraine since Feb 2022, the vast majority of them targeted at civilians. This air strike terror that Ukraine is going through - and it really is a form of terrorism, it meets all the defining characteristics - has effects far beyond the immediate casualties from the actual missile strikes, that you can\u2019t even imagine.Even for me it felt 'special\u2019, in a bad way, when a missile hit very close to my building while I was standing on the balcony having a smoke, last year in October in Dnipro. And I had just come back from months of daily bombardments with almost everything, short of missiles, that the Russian military has to offer, so at that point I was pretty much as used to this experience as anybody can possibly get. But there\u2019s a difference between daily life airstrikes in the context of frontline work, where you don\u2019t expect anything else, and getting hit by a missile in a big city far away from the front that suddenly out of the blue, literally out of the blue, disrupts your normal life. At the front you never feel safe by default, but in the middle of Dnipro going to the gas station, or having a smoke, you don\u2019t expect this. Even right now in Ukraine you don\u2019t, because your brain protects you from constantly being afraid as good as it can. Even I was in shock there for a moment before I grabbed my medic bag and gear (rescuers here wear body armor because Russians like to hit the same spot twice exactly to get the rescuers too) to go downstairs and help, and i can only imagine how much worse it must be for people who are completely unprepared for this.This airstrike terror is a_ huge_ part of this war, that Westerners aren\u2019t really aware of in this form. If you compare the numbers of soldiers dying in Bakhmut alone, let alone the whole frontline, versus civilians who died from missile strikes, or kamikaze drones, it looks like it\u2019s a minor issue, in the bigger picture. But it isn\u2019t, because it\u2019s not just about the dead and injured.Those of you who have grandparents who experienced some kind of bombardment during WW2 might now, that some of them are still not over it after decades, after decades of living in a safe place in a peaceful country. My grandmother had a friend who made this experience _once_, for _one_ day, as a kid, and as an 80 something year old woman looked like a frightened little girl stuck in the past when she told me about it. That\u2019s how deep the wounds can be that people suffer from being victim of this kind of terror. And Ukraine is experiencing this for over a _year_ now, with no end in sight. I know it\u2019s not the exact same kind of thing, but the effects on people are similar.I really hope that the generational trauma that this will cause can be turned into something good eventually and will make Ukrainians stronger in the end. But that might be naive, honestly\u2026 I hope it\u2019s not.\n \nreply",

      "I think the claim that Buckley's version of Hallelujah is better than Cohen's (even the initial 1984 version) is controversial, at minimum :-)The observations about obscurity are good ones, however -- A Confederacy of Dunces is a fantastic book, and it's hard to say how many other fantastic works of music, literature, &c. are lost in closets and old laptop hard drives.

It has the \"Lord of Song\" verse, but it didn't have the \"holy or the broken Hallelujah\" verse.The Canadian Tenors also have a composition that appears to draw from the Cohen rather than the Cale arrangement.Tori Kelly's cover has all the verses that I recognize from Cohen's version.\n \nreply",

      "Not just groups, magmas, semigroups, monoids, &c.I acquired a taste for algebraic structures and category theory by way of Scala+cats. While I no longer work in that space, the concepts are universally applicable.Just last week, I shared with teammates in our weekly symposium how merging counts was an associative operation, and how knowing that directly relates to being able to divide and conquer the problem into an implicit O(log n) operation. Being able to identify the operation as forming a semigroup directly contributed toward being effective in that problem space.The abstractness of the concepts is a double-edged sword. It allows them to be broadly applied, but it also requires more effort on the part of the observer to form the connection.\n \nreply",
      "This starts out as one of those \"how they came up with a part of mathematics\" stories, or explanations. But it rapidly gives up on explaining that. I don't think I've ever read a satisfactory explanation of what any mathematician was thinking when devising any part of mathematics. The subheading (which is probably written by an editor) is especially bad:> What do the integers have in common with the symmetries of a triangle? In the 19th century, mathematicians invented groups as an answer to this question.No. There is no way they were just sitting around and somebody said, \"you know what, I bet all the ways you can flip a triangle have something in common with adding the first 6 integers modulo 6, let's try inventing some abstract concepts and see if we can find one that makes this true!\"The quote from Sarah Hart says much the same thing: \"It's not like a bunch of mathematicians got together one day and said, 'Let's create an abstract structure just for a laugh.'\" But what were they doing? One group of size six is adding integers, which seems like an important thing (even when constrained to the first six). The other is ... flipping a triangle around. Who cares about that? The only real-world example of symmetries is when your mattress gets lumpy and you have a choice of ways to turn it. Why speculate, even for a moment, that turning a mattress and adding integers might be the same category of thing? Why reify flippin' shapes like that, why think about symmetries as a thing at all? I don't get it.\n \nreply",
      "I think it starts as a nagging feeling that there's a common thread between diverse stuff like transforming triangles, transforming more complicated/interesting shapes, numbers, and other weirder stuff. It's a natural instinct, at least for math people, to try to nail down and name that common thread. And then it takes, as the article mentioned, a lot of thinking and trying things to figure out the best way to formalize it. At least that's how I feel it in a niche way, trying to figure out my own formalisms for some things. Maybe you're just not that type of person, though.\n \nreply",

I'm thinking maybe the equivalence to triangle-flipping is just like an amusing conceptual side-effect that happened by accident when working out stuff about permutations?I don't think a Reuleaux roller functions very well if you flip it around a different axis, anyway, but I'll let you off because they're cute.\n \nreply",

      "> why did they imagine even for a moment that it might have some equivalence to the number line?A few of the groups which Galois introduced are what we now call Abelian (after Abel), which is to say that we can forget the order of elements within a product: AB == BA (if you get up to leave the beach and put on flip-flops then put on a shirt, you wind up in the same state as if you get up to leave the beach and put on a shirt then put on flip-flops)Number theory studies products of primes, and here, always, although we generally must write down multiplicands in some order, it doesn't matter which: 2*3 == 3*2.This connection would be enough for any modern undergraduate to consider applying general machinery built for quintics to the specific case of the number line, but in those days it took Euler (working before Galois) and Gauss[0] (working after? check this) to blaze the trails along this particular connection.> maybe the equivalence to triangle-flipping is just like an amusing conceptual side-effectNot just conceptual: spectroscopy is exactly why chemists are taught a little group theory, and triangle flipping is the simplest non-trivial[1] example.Like programmers, who spend their days building up data structures and picking them apart[2], chemists are concerned with synthesis (building up molecules) and analysis (picking them apart; in principle this includes synthetic steps that make small molecules from bigger ones, but in practice this means checking your product at the end of synthesis to confirm that you made lots of what you were hoping to make[3], and little of what you didn't want to make[4]).In particular, spectroscopy is a useful tool in chemical analysis, and very often[5] parts of a molecule will have a triangular symmetry, meaning that the peaks in a recorded spectrum[6] can be explained via a representation of the triangle-flipping group. If you set out to make, say, ammonia[7], but don't get any triangle-flipping parts in the spectrum when you run your tests (\"characterise your product\"), you know you failed[8].https://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/1725209167-20240901.png[0] when Laplace was asked who the greatest german mathematician was, he replied \"Pfaff\". when asked why not Gauss, he explained \"you asked for the greatest german mathematician; Gauss is the greatest european mathematician\" (compare: the LUB of a set need not be a member of that set \u2014 EDIT: I guess the set of working mathematicians is always finite, so this comparison falls)[1] in 0-D, a point has only the identity, so it's a degenerate group; in 1-D, a line segment does have a symmetry group (isomorphic to the booleans which are so important to CS) but unfortunately children do not learn about digons in elementary school, and must wait until they discover computer graphics to learn that edge AB is distinct from edge BA; indeed, they're explicitly taught to ignore that distinction in high school geometry, leaving the first non-trivial pedagogically-suitable example to be in 2-D: the triangle[2] we've made some progress on also building up functions with the same aplomb as we handle data, but we're still not very comfortable when it comes to taking functions apart[3] just as computer scientists often have a better-than-average knowledge of computer cracking, and physicists of bomb geometry, chemists tend to have a better-than-average knowledge of street syntheses. In particular, I have a second hand anecdote of undergraduates, who, having been in the process of characterising a synthetic product one evening, were interrupted by a grad student who, just by looking at the spectral lines, told them he hadn't seen anything that night but if they wished to continue exploring those particular [synthetic] pathways, they had better do so independently of university equipment.[4] just as software engineers (who know what corners to cut to produce huge numbers of right answers and an acceptable number of wrong ones much more cheaply than only right answers) are generally paid better than researchers, ChemE's (who know what corners to cut to produce huge amounts of wanted product and an acceptable amount of unwanted) are generally paid better than their purer colleagues.[5] why? (hint: it's the same mechanism \u2014related to Natural primes\u2014 that makes binary taxonomies so popular)[6] indeed, \"spectrum\" has been reborrowed back into maths to refer to something in algebraic geometry which is currently beyond my ken. If you poke around these areas long enough, you'll also find that von Neumann (who had physical, computational, and mathematical reasons to be interested) has had the \"von Neumann regular rings\" named after him, and rings are nothing but a pair of groups which interact in a certain manner. (the \"regular\" here being related to the \"regular\" in regular expressions, btw) Exercise: do regular expressions contain any rings?[7] as the last century taught us, being able to make ammonia is very powerful, having applications both desirable and undesirable.[8] Exercise: if you do see signs of triangle-flipping, is that enough to be sure you just made ammonia?\n \nreply",
      "Thank you for the extensive reply. There's a hint in there about commutativity inspiring the connection, but my mental model is now simply \"Euler did it\", which somewhat like creationism relieves me from having to ask further questions.Something I used to imagine: what if we were radically different creatures, like ant colonies, and by habit we communicated non-linearly (with thousands of limbs and organs swarming in parallel all over our mathematical work, perhaps written in 3D)? That could make equations mostly trivial, since our symbols wouldn't be constrained to any particular arrangement in the first place: and that seems kind of advantageous. But then grasping the concept of \"non-commutative\" would be a real strain for these poor ant-hills. They'd have to deliberately reintroduce linear ordering, maybe with special symbols to mark precedence.\n \nreply",
      "I dont want to get too far into a joint and doritos speculation here, but I wonder if the fact that humans have a very small capacity for holding multiple objects in their minds, a small number of physical digits, and excellent visual acuity is why we do a lot of math the way we do.

It takes us considerable mental effort to think about problems in ways that are not like this.An example that stayed with me for years is when Adelman of RSA fame considered whether DNA could be used as a computer. (Spoiler: yes). It basically does all the computations at once, and then discards all the non optimal solutions.\n \nreply"
