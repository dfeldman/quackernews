      "I think Porsche is really in trouble here.I\u2019m not anti-EV but the electric Macan and Cayenne look awful. They are under equipped technologically relative to their Chinese peers (heck basically anything).Porsche sort of sold its soul for this tech-forward design but it doesn\u2019t deliver any meaningful benefits, these cars don\u2019t even have level 2+ highway cruise control. In the meantime I get a bunch of crap screens and lose all the glorious physical buttons and I don\u2019t even have a fun engine rumble to make up for it?So, the cars are ugly and uncool (I grant a matter of taste), aren\u2019t selling in their target market (China) won\u2019t sell meaningfully in their backup market (US) and they\u2019re behind GM, Tesla and BYD in all regards on quality of life stuff.Not a recipe for endurance.reply",
      "The key part is electrified and not pure electric.reply",
      "I came here to say this. Also includes hybrids.reply",
      "Is this shocking? Obviously including PHEVs helps a bit, but even outside of this it is exactly what should be happening. Their biggest sellers are SUVs, and at these price points, the EVs can be substantially than their ICE counterparts. For 2026, they probably won't even need the PHEVs to get there, since the Cayenne EV is the best EV that they've built so far.reply",
      "a lot of these luxury brands have been eating off china the past few yearsbut now they've lost their luster since china makes cars better than most luxury brands and china has a moat in EVsso what's left is either the US or emerging marketsreply",
      "While the headline is interesting.I think the table at the end of the article is more so.- Worldwide sales -10% YoY- China sales -26% YoYAnd when you cross compare Porsche saying they sold more EV powertrains than their gas equivalents against China's new found foothold as the market leader in consumer electric cars (BYD, NIO, Xiaomi, etc...)Then I think you see an early indication not just of electric car dominance, but of the (very potential) rise of China as the premier automotive super power.reply",
      "China may become the superpower on volume but I would be surprised if the upper quartile (by price) of western buyers were interested in Chinese vehicles. Too much quality issues across the board on Chinese made products, unless you have a trusted non-Chinese company with stringent quality control (e.g. Apple model).I\u2019m sure they can handily win the lower end of the market though. And yes I\u2019m aware many western manufacturers are shit tier quality.reply",
      "in the australian market theres often comparison between how BYD/(chinese brands) may unseat Tesla (as the scale EV first mover), but I haven't seen what I think is the prize, which is BYD want to take on Toyota as the de facto king of global car making. They want the whole car market, not just EV and are already setup to take that on.reply",

      "> Chief among those hard-wired components, he said, is the Constitution\u2019s focus on states, rather than individual voters, as the basic \u201crepresentational unit.\u201d That arrangement \u201cshapes all the elements of our electoral and legal system,\u201d Rana said: the House and Senate, the Electoral College, Supreme Court confirmations. And this arrangement is partly why the U.S. Constitution is among the hardest in the world to amend. It doesn\u2019t simply undermine majority rule, he added; the minority it empowers are those who have historically weilded disproportionate influence in the political system.This is by design. The United States is exactly meant to be that: states that are united, but independent. The federal government was never intended to lord over everyone's lives. The expansion of the federal government, especially the powers of the executive branch, is the problem everyone seems to dislike (when their favored party isn't controlling this branch), and that's what needs to changereply",
      "I think they rightly pointed out that US States construct is problematic esp in much more interconnected world.However, I think fundamental problem still goes back to politics where Congress effectively does not do their job and thus fighting around executive and judicial leave us in worse place. Chevron and lack of it is mostly due to Congress just passing big stuff and then massive fights in courts when Congress could step in and be like \"Nope, we are changing our mind, this is happening.\"reply",
      "Congress moves too slow to be effective at thwarting off bad policy (largely written by lobbyists) until after it\u2019s done its damage. By then, the senators that sponsored the bill quietly retire. Or they double down behind closed doors to be elected well into their geriatric years. I\u2019m for term limits and age caps.reply",

      "One challenge is the executive can move fast while legislative/courts go slow by design. But the executive needs other slow branches for lasting change.Remember we were freaking out about a year to six months ago? A lot has either been absorbed into legal precedent, quietly rolled back by Congress / courts. But it takes a long time.Whatever comes out of these years that lasts will probably be because of SCOTUS more than Trump.reply",

I do believe that's the truth.My main complaint on the constitution, is perfectly explained,  ironically by the guy trying to defend it>>Feldman cited another reason to\ndefend the Constitution: It \u201chas the\ncapacity to evolve and change.\u201d In\n1919, he explained, Supreme\nCourt Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes\nJr. \u201cbasically invented modern free speech law,\u201d establishing, in a\nseries of opinions, the now-\nfundamental concept that free\nexpression should be permitted\nunless it poses a clear danger to\nothers. \u201cHe understood that the Constitution had to evolve,\u201d\nFeldman said.So there you have it. The reason the constitution is great because judges allow themselves to interpret it in ways it was never intended to be interpreted (sometimes based on loyalty owed to a political faction or) that aligns with the way they want it to be, not the way it is.That's frankly bonkers.

      "At this point, I am starting to feel like we don\u2019t need new languages, but new ways to create specifications.I have a hypothesis that an LLM can act as a pseudocode to code translator, where the pseudocode can tolerate a mixture of code-like and natural language specification. The benefit being that it formalizes the human as the specifier (which must be done anyway) and the llm as the code writer. This also might enable lower resource \u201cnon-frontier\u201d models to be more useful. Additionally, it allows tolerance to syntax mistakes or in the worst case, natural language if needed.In other words, I think llms don\u2019t need new languages, we do.reply",
      "Developed by Jordan Hubbard of NVIDIA (and FreeBSD).My understanding/experience is that LLM performance in a language scales with how well the language is represented in the training data.From that assumption, we might expect LLMs to actually do better with an existing language for which more training code is available, even if that language is more complex and seems like it should be \u201charder\u201d to understand.reply",
      "I don\u2019t think that assumption holds. For example, only recently have agents started getting Rust code right on the first try, but that hasn\u2019t mattered in the past because the rust compiler and linters give such good feedback that it immediately fixes whatever goof it made.This does fill up context a little faster, (1) not as much as debugging the problem would have in a dynamic language, and (2) better agentic frameworks are coming that \u201crewrite\u201d context history for dynamic on the fly context compression.reply",
      "A lot of this depends on your workflow. A language with great typing, type checking and good compiler errors will work better in a loop than one with a large surface overhead and syntax complexity, even if it's well represented. This is the instinct behind, e.g. https://github.com/toon-format/toon, a json alternative format. They test LLM accuracy with the format against JSON, (and are generally slightly ahead of JSON).Additionally just the ability to put an entire language into context for an LLM - a single document explaining everything - is also likely to close the gap.I was skimming some nano files and while I can't say I loved how it looked, it did look extremely clear. Likely a benefit.reply",
      "It's not just how well the language is represented. Obscure-ish APIs can trip up LLMs. I've been using Antigravity for a Flutter project that uses ATProto. Gemini is very strong at Dart coding, which makes picking up my 17th managed language a breeze. It's also very good at Flutter UI elements. It was noticeably less good at ATProto and its Dart API.The characteristics of failures have been interesting: As I anticipated it might be, an over ambitious refactoring was a train wreck, easily reverted. But something as simple as regenerating Android launcher icons in a Flutter project was a total blind spot. I had to Google that like some kind of naked savage running through the jungle.reply",
      "I think it's depressingly true of any novel language/framework at this point, especially if they have novel ideas.reply",
      "Not my experience, honestly. With a good code base for it to explore and good tooling, and a really good prompt I've had excellent results with frankly quite obscure things, including homegrown languages.As others said, the key is feedback and prompting. In a model with long context, it'll figure it out.reply",
      "But isn't this inefficient since the agent has to \"bootstrap\"  its knowledge of the new language every time it's context window is reset?reply",

      "Social media itself is a grand experiment. What happens if you start connecting people from disparate communities, and then prioritize for outrage and emotionalism? In years prior, you would be heavily shaped by the people you lived near. TV and internet broke this down somewhat, but social media really blew the doors off. Now it's the case that almost no one seems to be able to explain all the woes we're facing today: extreme ideas, populism, the destruction of institutions.\nAll of this because people are addicted to novelty and outrage, and because companies need their stock price to go up.reply",
      ">and then prioritize for outrage and emotionalismThis isn\u2019t inherent to social networks though.  It is a choice by the biggest social media companies to make society worse in order to increase profits.  Just give us a chronological feed of the people/topics we proactively choose to follow and much of this harm would go away.

      "> This isn\u2019t inherent to social networks though. It is a choice by the biggest social media companies and to make society worse in order to increase profits.going beyond social media it's IMHO the side effect of a initially innocent looking but dangerous and toxic monetization model which we find today not just in social media but even more so in news, apps and most digital marketsreply",
      "And if we want to go beyond that, we really just have to blame capitalism.  What happens when you build a society around the adversarial collection of money?  You get a society that by and large prioritizes making money above all else including ethics and morals.reply",
      "yes but it's more complicatedlike if you look at original reasoning why capitalism is a good match for democracy you find arguments like voting with money etc. _alongside with what things must not be tolerated in capitalism_ or it will break. And that includes stuff like:- monopolies, (or more generic anything having too much market power and abusing it, doesn't need to be an actual monopoly)- unfair market practices which break fair competition- situations which prevent actual user choice- to much separation of the wealth of the poorest and richest in a country- giving to much ways for money to influence politics- using money to bare people from a fair trail/from enforcing their rights- also I personally would add in-transparency, but I think that only really started to become a systemic issue with globalization and the digital age.This also implies that for market wich have natural monopolies strict regulation and consumer protection is essential.Now the points above are to some degree a check list of what has defined US economics, especially in the post-Amazone age (I say post Amazone age as the founding story of Amazone was a mile stone and is basically the idea of \"let's systematically destroy any fair competition and used externally sourced money (i.e. subsidization) to forcefully create a quasi monopoly\", and after that succeeded it became somewhat of the go-to approach for a lot of \"speculative investment\" founding).Anyway to come back to the original point.What we have in the US has little to do with the idea of capitalism which lead to the adoption of it in the West.It's more like someone took it is twisting it into the most disturbing dystopian form possible, they just aren't fully done yet.reply",
      ">- giving to much ways for money to influence politicsI think what we're learning is that mass (social) media means that this simply isn't preventable in a world with free speech.  Even if the US had stricter campaign finance laws in line with other western democracies, there still needs to be some mechanism so that one rich guy (or even a collection of colluding rich guys) can't buy a huge megaphone like Twitter or CBS.As long as there is no upper limit on wealth accumulation, there is no upper limit on political influence in a capitalistic democracy with free speech.  Every other flaw you list is effectively downstream of that because the government is already susceptible to being compromised by wealth.reply",
      "It's the combination of software that is infinitely malleable, and capitalism. Successful entrepreneurs in software want liquidity. So no matter how benevolent they start out being, they eventually lose control and the software gets turned into an exploitative adversary to satisfy investor owners.This is fine if you can refuse the deal. Lots of software and the companies selling it have died that way. But if you've made a product addictive or necessary for everyday survival, you have the customer by the short hairs.The technology underlying Bluesky is deliberately designed so that it's hard to keep a customer captive. It will be interesting to see if that helps.reply",

      "> 4. Ends up in test environment for, what, a month.. nothing using getaddrinfo from glibc is being used to test this environment or anyone noticed that it was broken\"Testing environment\" sounds to me like a real network real user devices are used with (like the network used inside CloudFlare offices). That's what I would do if I was developing a DNS server anyway, other than unit tests (which obviously wouldn't catch this unless they were explicitly written for this case) and maybe integration/end-to-end tests, which might be running in Alpine Linux containers and as such using musl. If that's indeed the case, I can easily imagine how noone noticed anything was broken. First look at this line:> Most DNS clients don\u2019t have this issue. For example, systemd-resolved first parses the records into an ordered set:Now think about what real end user devices are using: Windows/macOS/iOS obviously aren't using glibc and Android also has its own C library even though it's Linux-based, and they all probably fall under the \"Most DNS clients don't have this issue.\".That leaves GNU/Linux, where we could reasonably expect most software to use glibc for resolving queries, so presumably anyone using Linux on their laptop would catch this right? Except most distributions started using systemd-resolved (most notable exception is Debian, but not many people use that on desktops/laptops), which is a locally-cached recursive DNS server, and as such acts as a middleman between glibc software and the network configured DNS server, so it would resolve 1.1.1.1 queries correctly, and then return the results from its cache ordered by its own ordering algorithm.reply",
      "> Ends up in test environment for, what, a month.. nothing using getaddrinfo from glibc is being used to test this environment or anyone noticed that it was brokenThis is the part that is shocking to me. How is getaddrinfo not called in any unit or system tests?reply",
      "Probably Alpine containers, so musl's version instead of glibc's.reply",
      "As black3r mentioned (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46686096), it is likely rearranged by systemd, therefore only non-systemd glibc distributions are affected.I would hazard a guess that their test environment have both the systemd variant and the Unbound variants (Unbound technically does not arrange them, but instead reconstructs it according to RFC \"CNAME restart\" logic because it is a recursive resolver in itself), but not just plain directly-piped resolv.conf (Presumably because who would run that in this day and age. This is sadly just a half-joke, because only a few people would fall on this category.)reply",
      "The article makes it very clear that the ambiguity arises in another phrase: \u201cdifference in ordering of the RRs in the answer section is not significant\u201d, which is applied to an example; the problem with examples being that they are illustrative, viz. generalisable, and thus may permit reordering everywhere, and in any case, whether they should or shouldn\u2019t becomes a matter of pragmatic context.Which goes to show, one person\u2019s \u201cobvious understanding\u201d is another\u2019s \u201cdid they even read the entire document\u201d.All of which also serves to highlight the value of normative language, but that came later.reply",

      "I get they are fictional, but what strikes me from typical Victorian England proletariat dramas... Is that the British empire at the time had the largest empire in the history of the world. And their people lived in squalor in London.reply",
      "Yep.You\u2019re hitting a crucial paradox: Britain controlled the largest empire in history, yet most of its own population lived in dire poverty. I don\u2019t believe this was accidental.Imperial profits flowed almost entirely to a small propertied class (the landed gentry). The working classes.. who provided the soldiers, sailors, and labour.. saw virtually none of it whilst living in squalor. Before 1918, most British men couldn\u2019t vote at all; franchise was tied to property ownership.When we discuss \u2018the British Empire,\u2019 we\u2019re largely describing the actions and enrichment of perhaps 3-5% of the British population. Most Britons today can trace their ancestry back through generations of poverty and disenfranchisement, not imperial beneficiaries. It\u2019s an important distinction that\u2019s often lost in broader discussions of imperial responsibility, as if those who are generationally impoverished should share guilt.reply",
      "Dire poverty by modern standards, sure. But the 19th century saw a spectacular rise in living standards even for average Britons. The literacy rate in Britain was ~60% for men and 40% for women in 1800, by the end of the century it was near universal for both genders. Life expectancy at birth rose from ~40 to 50. Median wages rose, too, climbing ~50% from 1800 to 1850 (https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Real-wages-during-the-pe...).It is simultaneously true that the average Briton (arguably wealthy Britons, too) in 1900 lived in abject poverty compared to 2025, and the 19th century saw one of the fastest rises in living standards in Britain even among average Britons.reply",
      "Wasn't the literacy rate in New England substantially higher than the literacy rate in Old England, both in 1800 and in the years prior to its declaration of independence?reply",
      "You\u2019ve rather missed my point. I\u2019m not saying nothing improved. I\u2019m saying the imperial profits didn\u2019t go to the people doing the dying for empire.50% wage growth over fifty years whilst Britain\u2019s running the largest empire in history? Compare that to the United States over the same period. The US saw 60% real wage growth from 1860-1890 with no empire whatsoever. If imperial profits were trickling down, you\u2019d expect Britain to outpace non-imperial industrialising nations. It didn\u2019t.The literacy and life expectancy gains you\u2019re citing came from industrialisation and public health reforms, not imperial dividends. Meanwhile the landed gentry who actually controlled the imperial trade were getting obscenely wealthy.Life expectancy of 50 in 1900 still meant working-class Londoners in overcrowded tenements with open sewers, whilst their supposed countrymen lived in townhouses with servants. The Victorian poor saw industrial revolution gains, not imperial ones.reply",
      "Sounds pretty much like todayreply",
      "I mean you can only judge squalor if you also talk about how other people in capitals that were not London lived. Relative squalor might have been nice comparatively, or not, I have no idea.Plenty of poor people in the US yet people still go there.reply",
      "I've never heard anyone suggest that Britain should have focused on improving conditions at home before engaging in empire building. I always assumed the two were not mutually dependent. The expenses in running an empire probably paid for itself and no doubt returned a lot on the initial investment (after all the whole point of having an empire is to secure better trading). Meanwhile the conditions in the cities were a separate problem, and one which was hard to fix quickly given the population explosion and the Industrial Revolution.All of which to say, is while you raise an excellent point all the evidence i've seen suggests the two are entirely unrelated projects. If anything increasing globalisation in the long term increased prosperity for everyone involved (just not necessarily by equal amounts) and vastly improved conditions.If anyone has a counterpoint, by which i mean historical complaints or serious academic analysis, i'm happy to hear. None of this is a moral judgement on the relative evils and merits of empires and Victorian England, which is not the topic, just my opinion of why from a practical standpoint one has very little to do with the other.reply",
      "That's because any \"Empire\" is the extension of the ruler's ego.They weren't being imperial for their people.It was so they could brag to other royals and rulers that their kingdom was bigger.The people were resources and toys for the rulers' entertainment.reply"

To write a file you need to chain multiple function calls, but the shadow-stack prevents ROP and the sandbox prevents simply spawning a shell process to solve the problem.

      "Gordo and Bruce are pioneers in the gliding world. One of their coolest flights that shows their creative flight planning shows up in their 3000km flight in the Sierra Nevada's, and the build up to it.Some basics: The major challenge in flying gliders is the inherent stochasticity in the weather system. Think of it as a contextual bandit problem with high variance w.r.t local weather (i.e. Even the best planning cannot help if the weather doesn't comply). We have some observability due to forecasting tools (skysight.io) and any policy must have affordances for pilot skill and a margin of safety. A good pilot (or 'policy') starts with multiple plans, quickly modifies to plans to suit the environment, and can seamlessly switch between plans. The primary \"reward signals\" are duration of flight, distance covered, and (in competitions) hitting certain waypoints.Previous WR's for longest flight were mostly in the Andes or Alps. You want to be in a mountain range to utilize either the [ridge lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orographic_lift) of a mountain face or [mountain wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_wave), ideally in a polar region during the summer to maximize the daylight hours so you can fly under VFR for longer.However, while the Sierra Nevada's have great mountain wave and ridge lift, the number of daylight hours is not ``competitive''. Their main innovation was in acclimatizing themselves with using night vision goggles for long duration in a glider. There's an article on this [here](https://magazine.weglide.org/gliding-at-night-breaking-the-3...) which describes the acclimatizing flights and the 3k km flight in great detail. It doesn't get official recognition because the FAI requires the flight to be done in daylight, but still an extremely cool flight!reply",

The problem is, the blacks are much more washed-out because that light still has to go somewhere, so it's basically just being smeared across the entire display.This page shows lots of side-by-side photos of content that is primarily white, and most of the black bits (like text) are too small to make out.The comparison needs to use things like busy photographs with bright areas and black areas. Then you can judge how much more washed-out the black areas look.The second photo makes the Nano texture look pretty washed-out, but sadly doesn't include the traditional glossy laptop next to it for comparison, so it's impossible to tell.Also, in all the side-by-side photos the Nano screen looks like it's set to much brighter. So any fair comparison should have them set to equal brightness. There's no universe in which a glossy screen is going to make the white areas look darker, as they are in all these examples.I'm very curious if/how the Nano is better, but unfortunately these photos don't do anything to demonstrate it.reply",
      "Contrast is worse, it's a trade off. For me in most environments there will be bright reflections on the glossy screens, even indoors - your brain actually does a good job of ignoring them to the point you're not even conciously aware most of the time, but when you smear them out with the nano texture display it's just way more comfortable to look at, for me at least.If I was focused on watching movies, or grading photos in a dark room then glossy would be the way to go.reply",
      "Depends a lot on the screen and environment in my experience.A glossy Apple Studio Display or iMac (both of which have a decent antiglare treatment despite being glossy) in an office setting for example isn\u2019t too bad.On the other hand, your average touchscreen laptop (which are always almost-mirrors with no hint of treatment, for some reason) with screen angled up slightly and overhead fluorescent tube lighting or a skylight on the other hand? Borderline useless if the screen isn\u2019t bright enough to outshine the strong glare covering 40-60%+ of the screen.reply",
      "I really like the nano texture display. But I occasionally like to dabble with my camera, sometimes pushing things around in editing apps and after seeing how an unedited photo rendered on a coworkers macbook with the nano texture, I sadly went for the gloss on my own purchase. It's not a huge difference and probably not even a dealbreaker to most, but it's already hard enough to find a best fit for varied color spaces out there who I share photos with and I didn't want to add another variable to the equation. When you're trying to deal with shadows it does get annoying when you're nerfed even just a little bit trying to determine how much detail is in the shadows.It's admittedly a very obvious tradeoff, but part of me was hoping some new magic existed with the nano texture since everyone was ranting and raving about it on its release. Figured maybe just maybe it could've given me the best of both worlds. Nope. As it turns out people who make \"review videos\" often times don't know what the hell they're talking about. I've learned to tune those out and just source my purchasing info from people who do things im also interested in doing. In practical application it was an easy decision to make. For my use case glossy display just made more sense, I dork with photos/videos many times a year whereas I sit outside in the sun with my laptop maybe once a year if I'm traveling. And even in those scenarios the glossy display is fine.reply",
      "Appreciate the feedback and notes here- I would love to revisit the methodology and use a separate physical brightness meter to normalize for that. To my best memory I made sure both devices were at max stock brightness for each photo.reply",
      "I'd definitely recommend popping to an Apple store at some point and looking at a nano display in person. It's really kind of freaky, it has a paper-like quality to it that I've not seen with any other laptop display. I'm not sure a picture or a description is ever going to cut it.reply",
      "> Not a single demonstration of contrast?The nano-texture has less contrast.\"The nano-texture adds a filter-like appearance, resulting in a lower contrast ratio than the glossy panel. That said, there are differing opinions about the subjective appearance of the raised blacks. Some say it's a dealbreaker, while others prefer it, arguing that it looks more like what you would see on paper. The glossy panel produces a deeper, more Google Pixel HDR type of contrast that some find unnatural.\" \u2014 https://www.rtings.com/laptop/learn/apple-nano-texturereply",
      "This won't be a problem when Apple migrate all macs to OLED as blacks will be true black (no light).\nI have a Samsung SD95 that has a glare free chemical coating and it is amazing on rooms with too much light with no greyish black on low light conditions (at least from my personal experience).reply",
      "Last year, I bought a MBP with both screen types (at the recommendation of an Apple employee - they said just return the one I didn\u2019t like) and compared them side by side for a few days. I also spent some time in the Apple Store, looking at iMacs side by side, since they were the only things they had on display with the Nano Texture.tl;dr in perfect lighting conditions - which I noticed the Apple Store did a pretty good job at - the glossy screen wins, obviously. The contrast is quite a bit better, pictures really pop, and text isn\u2019t particularly affected. In anything other than perfect lighting, Nano Texture wins by a mile.If you\u2019re going to be doing any kind of photo or video work, you\u2019ll probably want the glossy screen, or (what I suspect most would have) the Nano Texture, with a dedicated external monitor for the best of both worlds.If you\u2019re primarily using your laptop for anything other than photo / video work, or if you use it mobile, you want the Nano Texture screen. I can\u2019t objectively say what you lose in contrast ratio, but it\u2019s not bad enough to overcome the huge disparity in glare reduction. I haven\u2019t regretted my Nano Texture MBP for a second.reply",

I got upset about that, and contacted Microsoft and convinced them to support it.But the deprecation of the x87 continued, as Microsoft C did not provide an 80 bit real type.Back in the late 80's, Zortech C/C++ was the first compiler to fully implement NaN in the C math library.reply",

      "I'm a big web components guy, but calling these web components is a massive stretch of the word component.The word \"component\" has to mean something ultimately, and to me the defining feature of a web component is that it's self-contained: it brings along its own dependencies, whether that's JavaScript, templates, CSS, etc. Web components shouldn't require an external framework or external CSS (except for customization by the user) - those things should be implementation details depended on directly by the component.This here is just CSS using tag names for selectors. The element is doing nothing on its own.Which is fine! It's just not web components.edit: Also, don't do this:    <link-button>\n      <a href=\"\">Learn more</a>\n    </link-button>\n\nThat just adds HTML bloat to the page, something people with a singular focus on eliminating JavaScript often forget to worry about.

That means you have to invent a lot of packaging and fluff surrounding the thing you want to sell to change peoples impression independent of the actual substance they will encounter.This to me is entirely backwards. If you want people to listen focus on your content, then make sure it is presented in a way that serves that content. And if we are talking about text, that is really, really small in terms of data and people will be happy if they can access it quickly and without 10 popups in their face.Not that I accuse any person in this thread of towing that line, but the web as of today seems to be 99% of unneeded crap, with a tiny sprinkle of irrelevant content.reply",

Shadow DOM is like an iframe in your page; styles can't escape the shadow root and they can't get into the shadow root, either. IDs are scoped in shadow roots, too, so the aria-labelledby attribute can't get in or out, either.@scope is the right abstraction: parent styles can cascade in, but the component's styles won't escape the element, giving you all of the (limited) performance advantages of Shadow DOM with none of the drawbacks.reply",
