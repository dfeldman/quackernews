      "I spot-checked one of the flagged papers (from Google, co-authored by a colleague of mine)The paper was https://openreview.net/forum?id=0ZnXGzLcOg and the problem flagged was \"Two authors are omitted and one (Kyle Richardson) is added. This paper was published at ICLR 2024.\" I.e., for one cited paper, the author list was off and the venue was wrong. And this citation was mentioned in the background section of the paper, and not fundamental to the validity of the paper. So the citation was not fabricated, but it was incorrectly attributed (perhaps via use of an AI autocomplete).I think there are some egregious papers in their dataset, and this error does make me pause to wonder how much of the rest of the paper used AI assistance. That said, the \"single error\" papers in the dataset seem similar to the one I checked: relatively harmless and minor errors (which would be immediately caught by a DOI checker), and so I have to assume some of these were included in the dataset mainly to amplify the author's product pitch. It succeeded.reply",
      ">this error does make me pause to wonder how much of the rest of the paper used AI assistanceAnd this is what's operative here. The error spotted, the entire class of error spotted, is easily checked/verified by a non-domain expert.  These are the errors we can confirm readily, with obvious and unmistakable signature of hallucination.If these are the only errors, we are not troubled. However: we do not know if these are the only errors, they are merely a signature that the paper was submitted without being thoroughly checked for hallucinations. They are a signature that some LLM was used to generate parts of the paper and the responsible authors used this LLM without care.Checking the rest of the paper requires domain expertise, perhaps requires an attempt at reproducing the authors' results. That the rest of the paper is now in doubt, and that this problem is so widespread, threatens the validity of the fundamental activity these papers represent: research.reply",

However: we do not know if these are the only errors, they are merely a signature that the paper was submitted without being thoroughly checked for hallucinations. They are a signature that some LLM was used to generate parts of the paper and the responsible authors used this LLM without care.I am troubled by people using an LLM at all to write academic research papers.It's a shoddy, irresponsible way to work.  And also plagiarism, when you claim authorship of it.I'd see a failure of the 'author' to catch hallucinations, to be more like a failure to hide evidence of misconduct.If academic venues are saying that using an LLM to write your papers is OK (\"so long as you look it over for hallucinations\"?), then those academic venues deserve every bit of operational pain and damaged reputation that will result.reply",
      "I would argue that an LLM is a perfectly sensible tool for structure-preserving machine translation from another language to English. (Where by \"another language\", you could also also substitute \"very poor/non-fluent English.\" Though IMHO that's a bit silly, even though it's possible; there's little sense in writing in a language you only half know, when you'd get a less-lossy result from just writing in your native tongue, and then having it translate from that.)Google Translate et al were never good enough at this task to actually allow people to use the results for anything professional. Previous tools were limited to getting a rough gloss of what words in another language mean.But LLMs can be used in this way, and are being used in this way; and this is increasingly allowing non-English-fluent academics to publish papers in English-language journals (thus engaging with the English-language academic community), where previously those academics they may have felt \"stuck\" publishing in what few journals exist for their discipline in their own language.Would you call the use of LLMs for translation \"shoddy\" or \"irresponsible\"? To me, it'd be no more and no less \"shoddy\" or \"irresponsible\" than it would be to hire a freelance human translator to translate the paper for you. (In fact, the human translator might be a worse idea, as LLMs are more likely to understand how to translate the specific academic jargon of your discipline than a randomly-selected human translator would be.)reply",
      "Good point.  There may be a place for LLMs for science writing translation (hopefully not adding nor subtracting anything) when you're not fluent in the language of a venue.You need a way to validate the correctness of the translation, and to be able to stand behind whatever the translation says.  And the translation should be disclosed on the paper.reply",
      "There are legitimate, non-cheating ways to use LLMs for writing. I often use the wrong verb forms (\"They synthesizes the ...\"), write \"though\" when it should be \"although\", and forget to comma-separate clauses. LLMs are perfect for that. Generating text from scratch, however, is wrong.reply",
      "> It's a shoddy, irresponsible way to work. And also plagiarism, when you claim authorship of it.It reminds me of kids these days and their fancy calculators! Those new fangled doohickeys just aren't reliable, and the kids never realize that they won't always have a calculator on them! Everyone should just do it the good old fashioned way with slide rules!Or these darn kids and their unreliable sources like Wikipedia! Everyone knows that you need a nice solid reliable source that's made out of dead trees and fact checked but up to 3 paid professionals!reply",
      "I doubt that it's common for anyone to read a research paper and then question whether the researcher's calculator was working reliably.Sure, maybe someday LLMs will be able to report facts in a mostly reliable fashion (like a typical calculator), but we're definitely not even close to that yet, so until we are the skepticism is very much warranted. Especially when the details really do matter, as in scientific research.reply",

      "> whether the researcher's calculator was working reliably.LLM's do not work reliably, that's not their purpose.If you use them that way it's akin to using a butter knife as a screwdriver.

      "I just want to say this isn't just amazing -- it's my new favorite map of NYC.It's genuinely astonishing how much clearer this is than a traditional satellite map -- how it has just the right amount of complexity. I'm looking at areas I've spent a lot of time in, and getting an even better conceptual understanding of the physical layout than I've ever been able to get from satellite (technically airplane) images. This hits the perfect \"sweet spot\" of detail with clear \"cartoon\" coloring.I see a lot of criticism here that this isn't \"pixel art\", so maybe there's some better term to use. I don't know what to call this precise style -- it's almost pixel art without the pixels? -- but I love it. Serious congratulations.reply",
      "Author here, and to reiterate another reply - all of the critique of \"pixel art\" is completely fair. Aesthetically and philosophically, what AI does for \"pixel art\" is very off. And once you see the AI you can't really unsee it.But I didn't want to call it a \"SimCity\" map, though that's really the vibe/inspiration I wanted to capture, because that implies a lot of other things, so I used the term \"pixel art\" even though I figured it might get a lot of (valid) pushback...In general, labels and genres are really hard - \"techno\" to a deep head in Berlin is very different than \"techno\" to my cousins. This issue has always been fraught, because context and meaning and technique are all tangled up in these labels which are so important to some but so easily ignored by others. And those questions are even harder in the age of AI where the machine just gobbles up everything.But regardless, it was a fun project! And to me at least it's better to just make cool ambitious things in good faith and understand that art by definition is meaningful and therefore makes people feel things from love to anger to disgust to fascination.reply",
      "It\u2019s almost like sim city (2000), but not quite. It night help if the overall mayo was fully square.reply",
      "I was extremely excited until I looked closer and realized how many of these look like ... well AI. The article is such a good read and would recommend people check it out.Feels like something is missing... maybe just a pixelation effect over the actual result? Seems like a lot of the images also lack continuity (something they go over in the article)Overall, such a cool usage of AI that blends Art and AI well.reply",
      "Basically, it's not pixel art at all.It's very cool and I don't mind the use of AI at all but I think calling it pixel art is just very misleading. It's closer to a filter but not quite that either.reply",
      "It's pixel art, just not the types of pixels most people want in pixel art.reply",
      "It's pixel art in the same way that everything rendered on a computer screen is pixel art. It's all pixels.reply",
      "Pixel art has a certain connotation (probably more accurately referred to as 8-bit or 16-bit).Otherwise every digital image could be classified as pixel art.reply",
      "Yup, not pixel art. I wonder if people are not zooming in on it properly? If you zoom in max you see how much strangeness there is.It kind of looks like a Google Sketchup render that someone then went and used the Photoshop Clone and Patch tools on in arbitrary ways.Doesn\u2019t really look anything like pixel art at all. Because it isn\u2019t.reply",
      "Yeah it leaves a lot to be desired. Once you see the AI it's hard to unsee. I actually had a few other generation styles, more 8-bit like, that probably would have lended themselves better to actual pixel-art processing, but I opted to use this fine-tune and in for a penny in for a pound, so to speak...reply"

      "It sort of already is. This behavior is only applied to sessions with a TTY and then the client can disable it, which is a sensible default. This specific use case is tripping it up obviously since the server knows ahead of time that the connection is not important enough to obfuscate and this isn't a typical terminal session, but in almost any other scenario there is no way to make that determination and the client expects its ObscureKeystrokeTiming to be honored.reply",

What's the scenario where it's fine that the client doesn't know if the server is using pastebin for backing up session dumps, but it's problematic that the server tells the client that it's not accepting a certain timing obfuscation technique?reply",
      "The behavior exists to prevent a 3rd party from inferring keystrokes from active terminal sessions, which is surprisingly easy, particularly with knowledge about the user's typing speed, keyboard type, etc. The old CIA TEMPEST stuff used to make good guesses at keystrokes from the timing of AC power circuit draws for typewriters and real terminals. Someone with a laser and a nearby window can measure the vibrations in the glass from the sound of a keyboard. The problem is real and has been an OPSEC sort of consideration for a long time.The client and server themselves obviously know the contents of the communications anyway, but the client option (and default behavior) expects this protection against someone that can capture network traffic in between.

      "It is fascinating that players would actually reject the game if it showed the true straight roads and planned layouts. We have a mental model of the Middle Ages that is wrong but we still demand that products match our expectations. The truth feels like a glitch because it breaks our immersion. We care more about the feeling of the past than the data.Also, it is logical that we optimize the past to make the gameplay loop satisfying. Real history was full of system failures like floods and unfair taxes that prevented any real progress. We code these simulations to give players a sense of progression that the actual people never had.reply",
      "Economics is something I think about all the time when playing these games or reading fantasy. We know that the ratio of farmers to non-farmers in the medieval period was something like 29:1. But so little thought is given to just the sheer amount of work and space it took to fill mouths and clothe bodies.I'm glad there was a mention of Banished, which does a decent job of capturing the slow struggle of subsistence living. It cannot be understated how many games Banished inspired - of them Manor Lords probably comes the closest to something historically accurate. And definitely fits the author's interests in a non-linear, non-grid based city builder.reply",

City builders are very similar to strategy games as they reward patience and strategy. In this article, I will take a look at one sub-genre of the city builder, the medieval city builder, and explain how this gaming genre relates to our knowledge of medieval settlement planning.The city builder has its origins far back in the 1990s in the combination of the strategy genre and the man"

      "This is directly relevant to my wife's and my reading of the David Tennant & Olivia Coleman vehicle Broadchurch.David Tennant's character is notably very bad at his job; that's why he got exiled to a backwater town. He bungled his last case so badly it made national news. In an American police procedural, we would either have some mitigating explanation for his failure, or at least some gritty vice or personal demon that was the real reason he got demoted.In Broadchurch, Tennant's character just sucks at his job. Every episode of the show conforms to a formula where he gets suspicious of one of the other characters in the show and we spend the episode wasting time while it's finally determined that the suspect of the week is actually innocent. I have to say, it makes for entertaining television. It also resulted in my wife and I chorusing aloud, every episode, \"he's SO BAD at his job!!\"(Minor Broadchurch spoilers) At the end when he finally catches the big bad, it's not because of anything he did. A coincidence and some carelessness on the part of the big bad lead to the mystery being solved. Also, every other character on the show had already been ruled out.Since watching it we've kept a lookout for protagonists who embody the \"everyman in way over his head who accomplished virtually nothing himself\" archetype.

      "> Why do I even need to do sales?> When looking specifically at bootstrapped (self-funded) SaaS startups, this is a valid question. There are many profitable startups in the low-end B2B space ($10-$50/mo) that exclusively rely on marketing. These are the perfect lifestyle businesses that the indiehacking community is dreaming of. But they\u2019re very hard to pull off, and leave a lot of money on the table.Fellow technical co-founder-turned-salesperson. I'd like to add something here.In previous businesses I relied on marketing, SEO etc.I thought \"they're the gift that keep on giving\" whereas sales is effort in value out. Not only is that wrong, but SEO / ads take time. For an early-stage company / product where iteration is key, sales is the fastest way to get signal.Imagine using web conversions as the driver for iteration. It takes at least a week to kick off some campaign, months to build up, and months to have interpretable data. Plus no one's going to just tell you \"no\"! With sales, you can send 100 emails and in one night get some real signal. You might even get an inkling of \"that's not going to work\" or \"ok I'm interested\". In a compounding feedback loop, that is often the difference between a company that pops off and one that fizzlesreply",

      "First of all, I\u2019m skeptical about these being free. Time isn\u2019t free, and the tokens to make these projects certainly weren\u2019t free.Second of all, all of these SaaS apps that don\u2019t actually have a need for recurring charge probably should be paid one time. I don\u2019t use Loom \u2014 I use CleanShot X and it was a one-time $30 payment and has a lot of great features I benefit from. I can\u2019t reimplement it in $30 of tokens or $30 of my time.But for an app whose use case doesn\u2019t change and is recurring for no reason? Yeah there\u2019s probably not much value in recurring payments outside of wanting to support the developer. I pay a lot of indie devs out of the goodness of my heart, and I\u2019ll continue to do that.But the value for \u201cSaaS apps\u201d without clear monthly costs should have always been under scrutiny.reply",
      "Most apps rationale for subscriptions is \"Ongoing development\" without an option like jetbrains etc. to fall back to a perpetual license.\nIn practice, regardless of whether an app needs ongoing development or not, this is the best way to try to guarantee continuous income and make a living off of a project I guess.Perhaps LLM's will force developers/companies to change their stance and to stop users from recreating what they have already created, just buy an at-a-time snapshot of their app for a one-time-fee? Probably not but one can hope.reply",
      "One-time purchase software would become dramatically more sustainable if platform churn could be ground to a halt. Most types of software achieved peak usability and functionality somewhere between 5 and 25 years ago and there wouldn't be much reason for anybody to upgrade if their one-time purchases continued to work in perpetuity.

      "It is not irrational on the part of the developer -- I've definitely felt this too.

We even have a bet book where we record and score predictions for some shows. It's makes watching much more engaging, especially if the creators hide details and foreshadowing in the background. But you don't even need high quality content to do this, just tighten the restrictions. Law and Order and Hallmark movies only get 30 seconds of content before we make predictions.It's much more stimulating than just passive consumption.

They shouldn\u2019t be, says Smith. The study\u2019s main finding was about workers who are required to stand for long periods (i.e. five hours or more) throughout their work shift, without opportunities to sit. Extending this to any worker who stands (e.g. an office worker using a sit-stand desk) is not correct. This is because office workers who stand at these types of workstations likely have the option to sit down when they get tired or when they feel pain in their legs and back.\"and\"Misconception #2: We no longer have to worry about the negative health effects of prolonged sitting, thanks to this study. Not so fast, says Smith. There was nothing in this study to refute the research on the health consequences of a sedentary lifestyle. Much of that research is about sitting too much throughout the day\u2014at work, while commuting and at home. This study only focused on prolonged sitting and prolonged standing at work.\"And even within the study, another finding about prolonged sitting at work got lost in the coverage. Yes, prolonged standing occupations were linked with twice the risk of heart disease as prolonged sitting jobs. However, prolonged sitting jobs were still linked, among men, with a 40 per cent higher risk of heart disease compared to jobs that involve a mix of standing, sitting and walking.\"[0]: https://www.iwh.on.ca/newsletters/at-work/90/standing-too-lo...[1]: https://www.iwh.on.ca/news/study-on-prolonged-standing-and-h...reply",

      "Makes sense. My perspective is that fast learners are fast because they   absorb information quickly without the overhead of cross-domain synthesis. They have more logical contradictions in their minds which they haven't resolved or aren't even aware of. Their worldview is not coherent as a whole. In some cases, they don't have a worldview; instead they just rely on expert data to inform their decisions... But the experts themselves are often victim to the same kind of domain-specific tunnel vision. Such people  often lack creativity in their work because cross-domain pattern synthesis is precisely how you can solve complex problems that haven't been solved before.reply",

      "It seems the criticism is indeed Berkson's Paradox, but the example is different to the canonical example of Berkson's paradox.In the canonical example, you have uncorrelated attributes, eg skill and attractiveness in actors, forming a round scatter plot with no correlation. Selecting a subpopulation of top actors who are either skilled or attractive, you get a negative correlation. You can visualize this as chopping the top-right of the round scatter plot off: the chopped off piece is oriented in roughly a line of negative correlation.In this example, if you look in the linked paper inside the post by Dimakis, there is a positively correlated scatter plot: You can tell the shape is correlated positively between youth and adult performance. But in this case, if you condition on the extremes of performance, you end up selecting a cloud of points that has flat to slight negative correlation.reply",

      "Berkson's Paradox seems to rely on the selection criteria being a combination of the two traits in question -- in the example I keep reading about, only \"famous\" actors are selected, and actors can be famous if they are either highly talented or highly attractive. But in TFA, surely the \"high performance\" selection filter applies only to the adult performance level?To put it another way: If selection was restricted to people who performed highly in either their youth or in adulthood (or both), Berkson's Paradox explains the result.

Reading the full paper [0], they say:   In sports, several predictor effects on early junior performance and on later senior world-class performance are not only different but are opposite. [...] The different pattern of predictor effects observed among adult world-class athletes is also evident in other domains. For example, Nobel laureates in the sciences had slower progress in terms of publication impact during their early years than Nobel nominees. Similarly, senior world top-3 chess players had slower performance progress during their early years than 4th-to 10th-ranked senior players, and fewer world top-3 than 4th- to 10th-ranked senior chess players earned the grandmaster title of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) by age 14.\n\nIt really does seem they took the set of people who were either elite as a kid, elite as an adult, or both, and concluded that this biased selection constitutes a negative correlation.[0] https://www.kechuang.org/reader/pdf/web/viewer?file=%2Fr%2F3...reply",
      "One interesting reason this happens, at least in the music field, is the adult disadvantages that often go along with various forms of savantism. I have spoken with a number of fellow music academics about this, and it's not uncommon that the things that make one a young prodigy are the same things that give one real obstacles to making it in the regular world, and this can impose a ceiling on where they get to. For example, many music prodigies have never \"really had to work\" and once they get to having to shoulder the boring reponsibilities that go with building a career, they instead alienate people, or just can't do things that are hard for them because it's always been easy. Maybe they can't play off charts unless they've heard it, or aren't used to following instructions/cues/being the lead, etc. And unless they are truly, truly rare air, real career gigs have boring work elements too.Savantism can be pretty damned weird. I've known a few, including a couple who will never have an adult career beyond local gigs because of their mental disabilities in other, non-music areas. The Oliver Sacks book \"Musicophelia\" has fascinating case stories about it.reply",

If you don't do it, you don't get paid by the government for whatever contract you have. Many people find getting paid to be beneficial.Now, it's not the vast majority of applications, but I'm sure there are a significant number of developers on HN that are working on applications that need to meet FedRamp requirements and posts like this point out potential pitfalls on what needs enabled.Not much different when dealing with stuff like STIGs. A large number of them are highly questionable and may only apply to very specific applications, yet you see barely trained button pushers saying you need to follow them. If you're aware of them when writing your application it will save a bunch of implementation headaches when it ends up in the field.reply",
      "The current FIPS-approved OpenSSL module was released in 2023. FIPS compliance does not even allow security patches to address issues.In my opinion, FIPS compliance is bad security practice and I suspect if a government agency called you on not meeting it, the justification of patching to address known vulnerabilities should hold up to scrutiny.reply",
      "FIPS is what happens when idiots get promoted and start reading too much LinkedIn CISO slop.If a customer demands FIPS compliance charge them out the ass for it. Its not inherently secure, it requires in some cases massive re-engineering of product and toolchains, and mostly seems to be an ask from clueless deep pocketed Fortune 500 companies looking to minimize liability claims after a breach by being able to point at their FIPS compliance.reply"

    "first_paragraph": "FIPS compliance is a great idea that makes the entire software supply chain safer. But teams adopting FIPS-enabled container images are running into strange errors that can be challenging to debug. What they are learning is that correctness at the base image layer does not guarantee compatibility across the ecosystem. Change is complicated, and changing complicated systems with intricate dependency webs often yields surprises. We are in the early adaptation phase of FIPS, and that actually provides interesting opportunities to optimize how things work. Teams that recognize this will rethink how they build FIPS and get ahead of the game.FIPS is a U.S. government standard for cryptography. In simple terms, if you say a system is \u201cFIPS compliant,\u201d that means the cryptographic operations like TLS, hashing, signatures, and random number generation are performed using a specific, validated crypto module in an approved mode. That sounds straightforward until you remember that modern software "
