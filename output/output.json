      "I see a big focus on computer use - you can tell they think there is a lot of value there and in truth it may be as big as coding if they convincingly pull it off.However I am still mystified by the safety aspect. They say the model has greatly improved resistance. But their own safety evaluation says 8% of the time their automated adversarial system was able to one-shot a successful injection takeover even with safeguards in place and extended thinking, and 50% (!!) of the time if given unbounded attempts. That seems wildly unacceptable - this tech is just a non-starter unless I'm misunderstanding this.[1] https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/78073f739564e986ff3e28522761a7...reply",
      "Their goal is to monopolize labor for anything that has to do with i/o on a computer, which is way more than SWE. Its simple, this technology literally cannot create new jobs it simply can cause one engineer (or any worker whos job has to do with computer i/o) to do the work of 3, therefore allowing you to replace workers (and overwork the ones you keep). Companies don't need \"more work\" half the \"features\"/\"products\" that companies produce is already just extra. They can get rid of 1/3-2/3s of their labor and make the same amount of money, why wouldn't they.ZeroHedge on twitter said the following:\"According to the market, AI will disrupt everything... except labor, which magically will be just fine after millions are laid off.\"Its also worth noting that if you can create a business with an LLM, so can everyone else. And sadly everyone has the same ideas, everyone ends up working on the same things causing competition to push margins to nothing. There's nothing special about building with LLMs as anyone can just copy you that has access to the same models and basic thought processes.This is basic economics. If everyone had an oil well on their property that was affordable to operate the price of oil would be more akin to the price of water.EDIT: Since people are focusing on my water analogy I mean:If everyone has easy access to the same powerful LLMs that would just drive down the value you can contribute to the economy to next to nothing. For this reason I don't even think powerful and efficient open source models, which is usually the next counter argument people make, are necessarily a good thing. It strips people of the opportunity for social mobility through meritocratic systems. Just like how your water well isn't going to make your rich or allow you to climb a social ladder, because everyone already has water.reply",
      "> Its also worth noting that if you can create a business with an LLM, so can everyone else. And sadly everyone has the same ideasYeah, this is quite thought provoking. If computer code written by LLMs is a commodity, what new businesses does that enable? What can we do cheaply we couldn't do before?One obvious answer is we can make a lot more custom stuff. Like, why buy Windows and Office when I can just ask claude to write me my own versions instead? Why run a commodity operating system on kiosks? We can make so many more one-off pieces of software.The fact software has been so expensive to write over the last few decades has forced software developers to think a lot about how to collaborate. We reuse code as much as we can - in shared libraries, common operating systems & APIs, cloud services (eg AWS) and so on. And these solutions all come with downsides - like supply chain attacks, subscription fees and service outages. LLMs can let every project invent its own tree of dependencies. Which is equal parts great and terrifying.There's that old line that businesses should \"commoditise their compliment\". If you're amazon, you want package delivery services to be cheap and competitive. If software is the commodity, what is the bespoke value-added service that can sit on top of all that?reply",
      "We said the same thing when 3D printing came out. Any sort of cool tech, we think everybody\u2019s going to do it. Most people are not capable of doing it. in college everybody was going to be an engineer and then they drop out after the first intro to physics or calculus class.\n A bunch of my non tech friends were vibe coding some tools with replit and lovable and I looked at their stuff and yeah it was neat but it wasn't gonna go anywhere and if it did go somewhere, they would need to find somebody who actually knows what they're doing. To actually execute on these things takes a different kind of thinking. Unless we get to the stage where it's just like magic genie, lol. Maybe then everybody\u2019s going to vibe their own software.reply",
      "You can basically hand it a design, one that might take a FE engineer anywhere from a day to a week to complete and Codex/Claude will basically have it coded up in 30 seconds. It might need some tweaks, but it's 80% complete with that first try. Like I remember stumbling over graphing and charting libraries, it could take weeks to become familiar with all the different components and APIs, but seemingly you can now just tell Codex to use this data and use this charting library and it'll make it. All you have to do is look at the code. Things have certainly changed.reply",

A person driving ~25 mph on average 24/7 would do ~4000 miles in a week (and we can assume 24/7 here because they reported active agents, so we assume a team of ~3 people swapping out as driver in this hypothetical).So that gives you a car/operator ratio of at least 14, and probably more since I bet the average speed is less than 25 mph.reply",

Not sure how much more energy it would use, but having a longer range for my notifications would be nice (at least on LAN). Being able to perform a few other actions independently of my phone would be great: weather % time updates, e-mail notifications, home assistant control, etc. I get that it may affect battery life as well.While I'm at it: tiny bug report, but I adjusted the time while the stopwatch was running, and this affected the stopwatch result.reply",

      "Is this the start of a more frequent code-migrations out of Github?For years, the best argument for centralizing on Github was that this was where the developers were. This is where you can have pull requests managed quickly and easily between developers and teams that otherwise weren't related. Getting random PRs from the community had very little friction. Most of the other features were `git` specific (branches, merges, post-commit hooks, etc), but pull requests, code review, and CI actions were very much Github specific.However, with more Copilot, et al getting pushed through Github (and now-reverted Action pricing changes), having so much code in one place might not be enough of a benefit anymore. There is nothing about Git repositories that inherently requires Github, so it will be interesting to see how Gentoo fares.I don't know if it's a one-off or not.

      "I really liked this part:In December 2024, during the frenzied adoption of LLM coding assistants, we became aware that such tools tended\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014to produce Go code in a style similar to the mass of Go code used during training, even when there were newer, better ways to express the same idea. Less obviously, the same tools often refused to use the newer ways even when directed to do so in general terms such as \u201calways use the latest idioms of Go 1.25.\u201d In some cases, even when explicitly told to use a feature, the model would deny that it existed. [...] To ensure that future models are trained on the latest idioms, we need to ensure that these idioms are reflected in the training data, which is to say the global corpus of open-source Go code.reply",
      "PHP went through a similar effort a while back to just clear out places like Stackoverflow of terrible out of date advice (e.g. posts advocating magic_quotes).  LLMs make this a slightly different problem because, for the most part, once the bad advice is in the model it's never going away.  In theory there's an easier to test surface around how good the advice it's giving is but trying to figure out how it got to that conclusion and correct it for any future models is arcane.  It's unlikely that model trainers will submit their RC models to various communities to make sure it isn't lying about those specific topics so everything needs to happen in preparation of the next generation and relying on the hope that you've identified the bad source it originally trained on and that the model will actually prioritize training on that same, now corrected, source.reply",
      "This is one area where reinforcement learning can help.The way you should think of RL (both RLVR and RLHF) is the \"elicitation hypothesis[1].\" In pretraining, models learn their capabilities by consuming large amounts of web text. Those capabilities include producing both low and high quality outputs (as both low and high quality outputs are present in their pretraining corpora). In post training, RL doesn't teach them new skills (see E.G. the \"Limits of RLVR\"[2] paper). Instead, it \"teaches\" the models to produce the more desirable, higher-quality outputs, while suppressing the undesirable, low-quality ones.I'm pretty sure you could design an RL task that specifically teaches models to use modern idioms, either as an explicit dataset of chosen/rejected completions (where the chosen is the new way and the rejected is the old), or as a verifiable task where the reward goes down as the number of linter errors goes up.I wouldn't be surprised if frontier labs have datasets for this for some of the major languages and packages.[1] https://www.interconnects.ai/p/elicitation-theory-of-post-tr...[2] https://limit-of-rlvr.github.ioreply",
      "I believe you absolutely could... as the model owner.  The question is whether Go project owners can convince all the model trainers to invest in RL to fix their models and the follow up question is whether the single maintainer of some critical but obscure open source project could also convince the model trainers to commit to RL when they realize the model is horribly mistrained.In Stackoverflow data is trivial to edit and the org (previously, at least) was open to requests from maintainers to update accepted answers to provide more correct information.  Editing is trivial and cheap to carry out for a database - for a model editing is possible (less easy but do-able), expensive and a potential risk to the model owner.reply",

Go concurrency is so easy!And then you point out issues in a review, so the author feeds it back into an LLM, and code that looks like it handles that case gets added... while also introducing a subtle data race and a rare deadlock.Very nearly every single time.

We built the graphistry stack 10 years ago (!) for GPU native end-to-end acceleration - data loading, wrangling, analytics, enrichment, viz, etc, all the way server GPUs to client GPUs - but this has been a huge sticking point. Major constant overheads for smaller workloads that seem avoidable.Essentially, we solved the problem of writing our stack in a bulk-oriented way that Nvidia kernels can optimize. Think apache arrow, pure vectorized dataframe pipelines, etc. However, cudf is 'eager' with per-step CPU/GPU control plane coordination, even if the data plane lives on the GPU. Polars in theory moves to lazy scheduling that can allow deforesting optimizations for more bulk GPU-side control macro steps, but not really. Nvidia efforts to cut python asyncio costs for multitenant etc flows didn't pan out either. So enabling moving more to the GPU here is super interesting.Will be watching!reply",

I guess your company is betting on solving problems like this (and async-await is needed for serving inference requests directly on the GPU for example).My question is a little bit different: how do you want to handle the SIMD question: should a rust function be running on the warp as a machine with 32 long arrays as data types, or always ,,hope'' for autovectorization to work (especially with Rust's iter library helpers).reply",

I'm not sure disallowing it would be the best idea as it cuts out possible optimizations, but outright allowing it without the user knowing the number of lanes can cause it's own problems. My job is the fun time of fixing issues in other peoples code related to all of this. I have no stakes in rust though, I'd rather write a custom spirv compiler.reply",

    "first_paragraph": "In 1987, economist and Nobel laureate Robert Solow made a stark observation about the stalling evolution of the Information Age: Following the advent of transistors, microprocessors, integrated circuits, and memory chips of the 1960s, economists and companies expected these new technologies to disrupt workplaces and result in a surge of productivity. Instead, productivity growth slowed, dropping from 2.9% from 1948 to 1973, to 1.1% after 1973.Newfangled computers were actually at times producing too much information, generating agonizingly detailed reports and printing them on reams of paper. What had promised to be a boom to workplace productivity was for several years a bust. This unexpected outcome became known as Solow\u2019s productivity paradox, thanks to the economist\u2019s observation of the phenomenon.\u201cYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics,\u201d Solow wrote in a New York Times Book Review article in 1987.New data on how C-suite executives are\u2014or aren\u2019t\u2014"

      "Somewhat off topic, as someone who hasn't used PostgreSQL and only has experience with mysql/MariaDB... I've never liked writing queries with numbered parameters from an array with placeholders like $1 in this example. I find them much easier to read and debug when I pass them with string keys, basically:`UPDATE t SET x=:x WHERE 1`\n`{x:42}`I found that the original node-mysql didn't even allow this, so I wrote my own parser on top of it. But I don't see this style of binding used in examples very often. Is it frowned upon for some reason?reply",
      "This is basically how we do it in .NET. With Dapper it\u2019s particularly neat sometimes because you can just pass an object that you were using anyway, and it will match parameter names to its properties case-insensitively.I.e.Query(\"select * from MyTable where Id = @Id\", myEntity)The idiom is to use anonymous objects which you can new up inline like \u201cnew { id, age = 5 }\u201d, where id is an existing variable that will automatically lend its name. So it\u2019s pretty concise.The syntax is Sql Server native (which supports named params at the protocol level), but the Npgsql dat provider converts it to PG\u2019s positional system automatically.reply",
      "PostgreSQL uses the format $1, $2 in the protocol, so I think it's just that nobody has bothered to implement named parameters in clients.In another style, postgres.js uses calls such as sql`select * from t where id = ${variable}` (which is safe because it's a tagged template, not string interpolation).reply",
      "If you're into Haskell prior art, there's postgresql-typed https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-typed-0.6.2.5... where you write queries, it safely(?) puts in your variables, and you automatically get back typed values.reply",
      "Very interesting, thanks!I see they use the same global approach as pg-typed (asking for a ParameterDescription / RowDescription, which aren't usually exposed by the PG drivers), but there are interesting differences in the details. Also this made me realise that I could also type enums automatically.reply",
      "Is there a way to make this work with https://github.com/porsager/postgres ? It's very close to raw SQL but with safe substitutions. I use it with Zod, but it would be great to have the types derived automatically.reply",
      "Unfortunately I haven't found a way to make it work.It would be quite easy to extract the queries to compute the types, but TypeScript doesn't handle tagged template literals well enough to link the query passed to the sql`` template to the return type.reply",
      "Seems very cool, if it works :) My suggestion here would be to provide a TS playground environment where I can inspect and poke around to see that the types really do work. I'd also love to see some more complex queries with joins, etc.reply",
      "How is this different than kysely + kysely-codegen (or hand-made types)?reply",
      "Kysely is a query builder: you build queries by calling javascript functions, while with pg-typesafe you write SQL directly.I've used kysely before creating pg-typesafe, and came to the conclusion that writing SQL directly is more convenient.A query builder works well for simple cases (db.selectFrom(\"t\").where(\"id\",\"=\",\"1\") looks a lot like the equivalent SQL), however, for more complicated queries it all falls apart. I often had to look at the docs to find how to translate some predicate from SQL to the required idiom. Also, I don't think kysely can automatically infer the return type of PostgreSQL functions, while pg-typed does (it asks PostgreSQL for it).reply"
