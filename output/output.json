      "This looks like a pretty cool device!However, I was immediately curious about how the \"dual battery\" feature works. The IP5306 power-management IC seems to be designed only for a single battery, and as far as I can tell from the schematic[1], the two battery connectors are just directly connected to each other in parallel (across VBAT and GND).This seems really sketchy. If you plug in two batteries that are not at the same state-of-charge, then you're going to get a very large current flowing from the higher-voltage battery to the lower-voltage one, probably significantly exceeding the batteries' rated current limits. At best this wastes a lot of power and generates a lot of heat, and at worst it could be a fire hazard.[1]: https://github.com/ZitaoTech/Hackberry-Pi_Zero/blob/main/Sch...\n \nreply",
      "I agree, this is a pretty bad idea.  I've used batteries in parallel many times, but it's always in the context of treating it as a single \"bank\" that is always charged at the same level, not as individual batteries which can be swapped separately.  Swapping a full battery in when the other one is low is going to result in a rapid rebalance of power until they get to the same level!You can think of it like having two big swimming pools side by side, slowly draining out into a little stream.  If the two pools are at the same level and the wall between them disappeared, they're largely going to be fine and keep on going.Now imagine one pool is nearly empty and the other is full.  As soon as you disappear that wall in the middle, there's gonna be a very powerful wave as the water from the high pool rushes in to fill the empty pool.\n \nreply",
      "At best this wastes a lot of power and generates a lot of heat, and at worst it could be a fire hazard.\n- you just described my high spec HP laptop.\n \nreply",
      "I read this part:> Replace your battery in 10 seconds without killing the power!as a suggestion that you'd have four batteries total, and you'd have two that're fully charged, and you'd replace one battery, and within seconds you'd replace the other. Or at least that's how I'd do it.I've recently read up about power management and battery charging, and want to make a charge controller than can connect two separate banks. I wonder how hard it'd be to change the IP5306 in the Hackberry Pi Zero to handle the two batteries separately.\n \nreply",
      "It should definitely use the plural, batteries, if that's the intention.\n \nreply",
      "acktually, traditionally, 'batteries' referred to two or more cells. This keeps with the etymology of the word as an emplacement of cannon or guns. If OP meant a single cell, they should have written 'cell', not the singular 'battery'.\n \nreply",
      "And if you screw up which battery is which?\"Do things exactly right, quickly, or the device bursts into flames*\" is not acceptable electronics design, even for something you intend to use yourself.* do you really want to trust a generic battery's built-in protection IC?\n \nreply",
      "I was going to launch into a lecture about how battery isolation is a Thing, very simple, etc and the author couldn't possibly be dumb enough to not isolate them with diodes, but then I looked at the schematic and yiiiiiiiikes, they're both just tied together, I think. There's a charge management IC and a MOSFET as part of the USB power input...and that's it.I was sketched out by BSI not being connected to anything, but it seems it's a fixed resistance battery size/chemistry ID function, not a temperature sensor. That said, I don't see any over/under temperature protection except for some sort of vague temperature limit in the charge IC (which is not thermally coupled to the battery in any way, so only a general \"the device is way too hot\"), so hopefully that's in the battery - don't go buying any cheapo clones.I also don't see any fusing, which is a huge no-no. A polyfuse is a twenty cent (ish) part. Again, an official battery would have an internal BMS circuit and prevent overcurrent events, but people are probably going to go for the almost-cheapest battery on Amazon/Ebay. Not to mention counterfeit problems even if you do try to get an OEM battery.\n \nreply",
      "I understood it as it'll use only one of the batteries, but you can swap between which is used. So initially, you have two charged batteries, while using only one. Once you run out of power in the first one, you'll switch to the second, and now the first one could be swapped to a fully charged one. Blue/green deployments, but for batteries basically.\n \nreply",
      "It would be convenient if it worked that way, but since the batteries are connected across each other in parallel, they will both be discharged simultaneously. And as soon as you hot-swap one of the nearly-discharged batteries for a charged one, it'll be more-or-less short circuited across its discharged counterpart.To do what you describe, you would need additional components to \"switch\" one battery at a time into the power path. (This can be done with a single transistor if you're only worried about current flowing in one direction, but I believe it's trickier if you want to support both charging and discharging in the same circuit.)\n \nreply"

Of all the things I saw in that magazine, the space elevator made of carbon nanotubes was always the one that stuck with me.

      "There's a simple point about space elevators that most people ignore.We would only build a space elevator if it made economic sense.  Given the reality of construction costs, even if we had the materials, it would like cost many trillions of dollars (at least) so whatever we used it for would have to produce much more value than that.Even more importantly, if we had access to the materials necessary to build space elevators, there are other, much more pressing terrestrial needs that would use up all those materials long before somebody tried to build an elevator.No matter how much fun it is to contemplate their existence, nobody has come up with a justification for the necessary investment required to build and operate one.\n \nreply",
      "> Given the reality of construction costs, even if we had the materials, it would like cost many trillions of dollars (at least) so whatever we used it for would have to produce much more value than that.This doesn't seem that difficult given the potential value of mining.

      "If we're pushing \"out of the box\" ideas, why not just use hydrogen balloons to hold up a railgun for the first 20,000 meters of altitude? The ambient pressure at the end would be about 1/10th of that at sea level. You could have outriggers with a very thin high voltage power line to enable station keeping via thrusters (repurposed quadrotor parts?)I wouldn't be surprised it the ambient electrostatic field from the atmosphere were sufficient to power station keeping, or at least some of the instrumentation.If that works, I'm sure they could extend it to twice as long, almost into space.\n \nreply",

      "The main cost of getting to low Earth orbit isn't gaining altitude, it's gaining speed. Even if you could levitate a spacecraft to, say, 200 km altitude at zero cost in energy, you would still need about 97% of the energy to get it to orbital speed, that you would have needed to launch it from the Earth's surface.\n \nreply",

      "Right, but AFAIK there is no way to query a WARC file, is there?Let me explain where I am coming from. I'm working on an (open source, self-hosted) service to help people migrate from Reddit to Lemmy, called Fediverser [0]. It offers the following:- A crowdsourced map of \"reddit-to-lemmy\" alternatives.\n - Use the list of subreddits and some preferences to find a Lemmy instance that is suitable for you.- Lets people sign up to a \"fediversed\" Lemmy instance directly via Reddit OAuth. Simplifies the registration process, can let an admin skip the verification process (e.g, reject redditors whose account are less than 3 years old)- Using the crowdsourced data, automatically subscribe the user to the communities that correspond to their favorite subreddits.- If the admin of the Lemmy instance so chooses, it can also set up mirror bots, which will create \"shadow accounts\" for each reddit author. This shadow account can then be \"taken over\" by the real redditor if/when they sign up to the instance.I believe that these features together would lead to a credible threat to Reddit's dominance. My remaining \"problem\" to solve is, simply put, that I need more people running this, because it's just too much data for a single node. I set up an instance that was mirroring ~100 reddits (posts and comments). In three months, my database was already recording ~3 million \"shadow\" users and ~10 million posts + submissions.For this to work, I either need to have more instance admins willing to run the Fediverser software, or I need to move the \"shadow\" users and the mirrored content straight to the client and only bring to the Lemmy server the content from users who actually migrated.[0]: https://fediverser.io\n \nreply",

If they shut down the API entirely, they would lose a lot of value which would accelerate their demise.2) A more cynical person would say that without bots, Reddit would lose 30-40% of its \"traffic\", and that they can not afford to do that. This is why the current API is still quite generous. It's enough for most bots, but just too expensive for third-party clients.3) Even if Reddit shut down its API tomorrow, the majority of interesting content has already been copied/archived.4) Scraping old.reddit is quite easy, and getting rid of it altogether is not something that they are willing to do.All in all, I'd say that if we ever get to a point where Reddit is cutting down the API, it will be a time to celebrate.\n \nreply",

By doing so, they resolved a long-standing mystery about solar cycles during that period, according to a recent paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.Precisely who first observed sunspots was a matter of heated debate in the early 17th century. We now know that ancient Chinese astronomers between 364 and 28 BCE observed these features and included them in their official records. A Benedictine monk in 807 thought he'd observed Mercury passing in front of the Sun when, in reality, he had witnessed a sunspot; similar mistaken interpretations were also common in the 12th century.

They found the same correlation that the original study did. But when they controlled for household income, they found most of the correlation disappeared.The obvious conclusion is that household income is a predictor of both:- inability to delay gratification, and- higher academic achievementThis makes sense when you consider that someone growing up in a poor household may have both:- less reliable/continuous/predictable access to material things, meaning they would rationally seize immediate opportunities rather than taking the risk of a larger future opportunity, and- less academic supportNow, this new study (OP) goes even further, finding that the correlation itself is weak.[0] Watts, T.

It sucks if the start-up fails, but they're still a billionaire, probably. Their lifestyle doesn't change substantially. Compare to a low-income worker choosing a car: maybe a cheap used one that could break down at any time, or a more expensive one is less likely to break down (if you stay up-to-date with expensive maintenance), or a much more expensive new car that is unlikely to break down (but that puts them in a substantial amount of debt). In every case, there's a way for the prospect to go sideways in a manner that would likely end with the worker losing their job, with (statistically-speaking) no savings cushion.

      "> POSIX allows file descriptors to be shared by an arbitrary number of processes, after e.g. forks or SCM_RIGHTS transfers (even though this use case is most likely very rare, so it\u2019s not entirely impossible for this state to be moved to userspace).Normally it\u2019s rare, except shell functionality crucially depends on it[1].The way to think about this, IMO, is that while a disk file is more or less random-access, when you open it unavoidably turns into strange hybrid of a random-access byte array and a (seekable) byte stream (classically, the \u201cfile description\u201d), and that is what the resulting fd and any of its copies point at. Seekable streams made some sense in the age of tape drives, but nowadays it seems to me that random-access files and non-seekable streams have enough of a gulf between them that forcing both to appear like the same kind of object is more confusing than helpful.(I don\u2019t know what my ideal world would look like, given I still like to direct streams from/to files. I still dislike the \u201cfile description\u201d business rather strongly.)[1] https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/DupSharedOffse...\n \nreply",
      "Ah! Well as a systems programmer, it's not so rare. FDs are really not a friendly interface, and I'd love a better interface (FDs have their quirks), but as an application programmer, it's really sad we don't take advantage of FD passing to build more modular programs. For instance on desktop operating systems, you pass paths, not capabilities to use files, and the norm is giving programs access to read large swaths of user data. This is not secure, and it's one of the issues well-passed FDs could help solve. In general, despite the challenges in making them secure, I'd strongly advocate for more modular and integrated applications.As for the seeking abstraction, it fits well with other buffered device driver information streams. Yes, it's a complicated and confusing interface, but the key thing is it allows you to share an OS/system/hardware level resource between multiple programs. We want to take advantage of that. It's the abstraction we've got sure, but it's what we do with it that counts!\n \nreply",

The Lisp-2-ish way Tcl object systems approach this feels interesting, but still a bit off from a real solution.My reading of TFA was that it\u2019s rare for it to be important that descriptors sharing a description thus also share a file position.

My point was that having some objects (fds, whatever) support {fstat, read/write} only and others {fstat, pread/pwrite, mmap} only would get rid of the confusing user-visible notion of \u201cfile description\u201d.

      "Back in the old days, early 1990s Net Neutrality actually meant something, and was not an overloaded nebulous term like today. It was very simple, being a boiler-plate contract clause between Internet routers, such as universities that peered with eachother. In peering agreements there are several contractual clauses, and the net neutrality was simply sayign that each side of the agreement would forward packets without any interference. In some cases this causes one side to disproportionatly overload the other, but with increased peering the load would ballance out as time went. Many universities had this kidn of agreement with other universities they peered with back in the days of inter-academic networks. No reason to router over the internet when reasearchers can direectly access paperes on the backside, and everything was peachy... Net Neutrality meant something, and it was a very concrete idea.Transiting services changes things, those are not exactly peering agreements, it more like a company connecting one university to another, and that traffic was interfered with... usually to simply offload the packets/frames off the network as quickly as possibly, or in other cases to not impact other higher paying customers.... and those packets/frames would transit over a crappy legacy network to be dumpped on the other side with little care for  quallity beyond the minimum agreement.This is why it's so weird for consumers to say they get to have Net Neutrality, because consumers are not normally peering with other consumers, or universities, or whatevery industry. Their just end nodes on the network, and there is fundamentally nothing to be neutral about.When it comes to netflix complaining about some ISP refusing to peer with them for free, it's also very strange, because there is no mandate to freely peer with anybody. And, when a traffic hogs asks to peer with you (as an ISP) that would certainly entail a higher level of network management or infrastructure. So again, these net neutrality crusaders are very strange when looked at in perspeective of the OIG net neutrality.Should the internet be a common carrier, in my humble opinion probably yes. But that's orthogonal to the meaning of Net Neutrality. The point is it's an overloaded term that means nothing anymore.\n \nreply",
      "> some ISP refusing to peer with them for freeThe issue,  as I remember it being presented decades ago,  is that both the ISP and Netflix were using a common carrier or an internet exchange.  The ISP is noticing that much of the inbound traffic from this peering point originates from Netflix.They approach Netflix and say \"we are going to actively deprioritize your traffic unless you enter in to an exclusive direct peering agreement with us,  where we set the terms,  and you will pay extra to have all of this traffic delivered reliably on our network.\"Allowing this opens the door for the ISP to do this to anyone it thinks it extract extra fees from.  Further,  since many of these ISP networks also own content delivery networks and some eventually just became content producers themselves,  all on top of a natural infrastructure monopoly,  the arrangement were less likely to benefit consumers and more likely to create permanent illegal monopolies.We've tried to solve this problem in multiple ways.  The peering \"net neutrality\" would be one.  The forcing ISPs to act as \"common carriers\" and allow third parties to operate on top of their networks the way we did with DSL would be another.> But that's orthogonal to the meaning of Net Neutrality.Perhaps the original case was always just subset of the overall problem?\n \nreply",
      "> when a traffic hogs asks to peer with you (as an ISP) that would certainly entail a higher level of network management or infrastructure.Why wouldn't the ISP refuse to peer with them, then? This is a genuine question, I don't understand the industry as well as you seem to.To my understanding, net neutrality doesn't mean \"every ISP has to peer with anyone who asks\". It just means \"you can't treat packets differently based on where they came from\".If it's really so terrible to deal with an ISP that dumps tons of Netflix traffic on to your network, then don't peer with them, problem solved, right? Seems like the reality is that ISPs *do* want to peer with Netflix's provider, they just also would like to have the right to demand additional money directly from Netflix for doing so.Obviously as operators of the network they have the technical ability to do this - the question is whether it's good for society / economy / etc for them to be allowed to.\n \nreply",

      "While this phrases things in terms of Riemannian geometry, it seems to me like this is really about more fundamental metric properties, but I find its terminology a bit unclear.  Would it be correct to summarize this as saying is that color space is not a length space / geodesic space? (See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_metric )(Yes \"length space\" (or \"path space\") and \"geodesic space\" are not exactly the same thing, but \"length space but not geodesic space\" doesn't exactly seem like a very likely possibility.)\n \nreply",
      "Changing the triangle inequality to a strict one and claiming that the result is non-Riemannian is a bit dubious.First of all the difference between a strict and a non-strict inequality is not that big, stating two things are never exactly equal is nigh impossible to measure, especially for something subjective.Secondly that could happen simply by reporting distances in some non-linear fashion, and who cares if the unit of distances is non-linear? If there is a metric that correctly identifies which colour is closer then we're in business, nobody ever said this had to correspond linearly to whatever measure of perceptual distance someone came up with.\n \nreply",
      "> Consequently, we need to adapt how we model color differences, as the current standard, \u0394E, recognized by the International Commission for Weights and Measures, does not account for diminishing returns in color difference perception.This isn't to reduce the notability of the article, but isn't BIPM's interest in any color-perception stuff basically limited to making lightbulbs roughly equally bright? (i.e. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficiency_function) I guess I don't see how even nonlinearity in perceptual space matters for that purpose.\n \nreply",
      "I love the drama of how the abstract is written, but TBH I don't think this is a surprise.  I believe it's well-known among color theorists that large perceptual distances are inconsistent with sums of small differences.

Ramsay (30) suggests that the principle of diminishing returns or its opposite may have been spuriously identified by otherresearchers (daringly including his PhD advisor, Helm) because of experimental procedures (successive intervals, paired compar-isons) ill suited to the task. Indeed, open-ended and criterion-dependent tasks give less accurate measures of similarity because of individual factors and the difficulty of the task\u2026\n  Instead, we use a more reliable two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, where the participant simply answers the following question: \"Which is more different?\" Specifically, we use a triad arrangement of stimuli with the reference in the middle and one test on either side.

It takes a lot of tenacity and determination to go against something when everyone is constantly telling you you're wrong.

In that order, but pretty much equal- From 1940-1980, two of those three (family, primary school) trended sharply downward, as did \"met in church\", while these trended upward: met through friends, met in bar or restaurant, met as or through coworkers, met in college. \"met through friends\" was by far the most common circa 1980- starting in 1995 \"met online\" sees a sharp rise, and by 2010 it has overtaken them all.The only other category that was still on the rise after 2010 was \"met in a bar or restaurant\". Is that really increasingly common? I have a strange feeling that some of those are just people too embarassed to say they met online...Anyway, my point is there was (perhaps unsurprisingly) already a big shift going on 1940-1980, namely that the immediate family, church, childhood friends became less dominant in people's lives and friends, work, commercially-facilitated interactions (bars and restaurants) became more central. Did we learn anything from that adjustment? Were people in the 80's and 90's talking ad worrying about this the way we're talking today about the way social interactions are replacing the \"old\" ones?(also, the values for \"met online\" on that graph seem to be small but non-zero in the 1980s! I'd like to hear the stories of some of those couples...)\n \nreply",
      "> (also, the values for \"met online\" on that graph seem to be small but non-zero in the 1980s! I'd like to hear the stories of some of those couples...)IIRC Jason Scott's BBS documentary mentions this a bit. There's a couple that shows up a number of times that met on a BBS.\n \nreply",
      "> I have a strange feeling that some of those are just people too embarassed to say they met onlineProbably right.  I don't really get the stigma, but I've known a few people personally who told the same lie and found later it was online.  One in particular had a huge elaborate story about their bar meeting.  His wife told me later one day he basically selected her from a website.So like most questions, probably worth taking self reporting with a giant dose of salt.\n \nreply",

      "It creates a much worse problem actually. Why have a committed relationship when you can always press a button to look at hotties and have a pull at the sex slot machine?If they design the system right, their audience just won't marry or have long term stable relationships\n \nreply",
      "Do people go on dating sites to look at \"hotties\"? I've heard there are better websites to do that, many free of charge!(Not a rhetorical question - as a queer person who's never used a dating site or app and who's been in a long-term relationship (now married) for almost 8 years now, I really do have no idea what people do on there.)\n \nreply"
