      "I was a math major in undergrad, we care about typesetting so much because you really do not want to be stuck handwriting everything, but it's not easy to be faster typing than you are with handwriting when you're writing out rows and rows of equations. (Actually physics was generally a lot harder for me to keep up with while typing than math was.)And when your life is revolving around classes or your thesis, the #1 most important thing to you in the world is how easily you can transfer your ideas to paper/digital format. It makes a lot of sense that people care a lot about the quality of their typesetting engine and exchange macro tips with each other (I got a lot of helpful advice from friends, and my default latex header was about 50% my own stuff and 50% copied from friends in my same major)\n \nreply",

I wrote it in Typst, not LaTeX. In this post I will talk a bit about what went well and what didn't.Typst (https://typst.app/) is a modern take on a typesetting language that I think has a real shot at dethroning LaTeX. I would describe the language as a mix of markdown and dynamically typed Rust, which may sound weird but is a really nice fit. Day-to-day document writing being markdown-like is very comfortable (certainly much nicer than littering your writing with \\). The scripting language is powerful, well thought out, and makes it very easy to jump between code and typesetting. For exampleProducesThis is bold text.

      "I love Home Assistant.Many years ago we gave our then-toddler an old digital camera to play with. Some time later, we looked at the pictures he took. We were horrified to find out that he took pictures of the outside of the house at night. As in, our toddler would unlock and open the front door, go outside (at night!), take pictures of the house, go back in, close and lock the door, and go back into his bed. I bought some wireless door sensors and created an automation where if the sensors are triggered between 10pm and 6am, the lights in our room would turn on to wake us up.I expanded this later and today we have sensors on all doors/windows that kids can use to leave the house (we have 4 young kids). As it happens, these are the same doors/windows that burglars can use to enter the house, so this doubles as an alarm system (that we can activate when we leave the house and will notify us remotely if the sensors are triggered).The best part is that with Home Assistant you are not locked into an app/ecosystem. Our door/window sensors are of a different brand than our lightbulbs, and we control everything from a single app.\n \nreply",

The thought process, for a toddler, to do that, to want a photo of the outside of the house at night enough to do that. That's some high level curiosity, worth fostering.One of mine at that age would have had that level of quirkiness, but probably would have been too scared of \"the dark\" (also, our house already had a security system installed when we bought it, which we still set off accidentally every now and then, so the kids would probably have known that as well).\n \nreply",

One of the gent's window sensors used to \"die\" far quicker than any of the others and eventually stopped working.

One of the two gent's sit down toilets is generally preferred to the other for very minor reasons but it is preferred.So, the battery terminals were getting slightly corroded on that window sensor because it was open more often to the outside environment.I've rubbed a bit of silicone sealant into the crack between the two parts of the sensor and expect that it will survive better now.\n \nreply"

This follows fairly closely to AWS\u2019s recommended best practice of using a separate, centralized account for an immutable history of backups and log. In the case of logging, this is a no-brainer. Most services require just a few simple tweaks to copy logs to a centralized location. However, the story is a bit different for backups. AWS Backup\u2019s lack of support for the combination of differing regions and account is unfortunate.

      "\u201cOn the Road\u201d has many vivid depictions of San Francisco circa 1950. Most remarkably they spend almost all their time in the Mission, because this is where all the work is at docks and warehouses, and when they go out at night the jazz clubs and bars are always nearby. And as it is described there are so many of these nightclubs that they can hop to a new one every hour, and do this every night for weeks and never run out of places to go. It\u2019s a city as a party, and seems to contrast with the current reputation as a bit suited up and stale.What remained the same was the characters all living in precarious situations of housing, usually finding a flop house or sleeping on someone\u2019s couch and so on. The transient nature of the city hasn\u2019t changed much. But Dean Moriarty is able to rent a home for a family of 4 on Pacific Hill for two years while barely holding down odd jobs for more than a few weeks at a time. That\u2019s different!Kevin Starr\u2019s magisterial history of California really revolves around San Francisco. It\u2019s a beautiful story in five parts. The first is the Spanish Mission, then the Gold Rush boomtown, then wartime depot (this is what \u201cOn the Road\u201d describes), then the hippie utopia, and now the tech center (I like to call it the \u201cunicorn stable\u201d). I wonder how we will reminisce about the San Francisco of today in 50 years.\n \nreply",
      "San Francisco was not associated with tech or Silicon Valley until the late 2000s-early-2010s, when companies like Twitter and Uber opened headquarters here because of tax incentives. Then startups started popping up everywhere and it transformed the entire city, to its detriment.As a tech worker myself, I think San Francisco pre-tech boom was a great city that was a lot of fun to live in, but afterwards, there were simply too many rich young tech workers that filled every venue and every activity to the point where it's intolerable. Everyone was trying to complete the 8x8 list and become a Yelp Elite member, and getting into any decent restaurant meant waiting in line for 90+ minutes. The city became very unaffordable and the people were much angrier because of how much harder they had to work to afford living there.I have several friends who were not in tech but rather different walks of life, from publishers to graphic designers, nurses, government workers, etc. They are all gone now to different cities because it was too expensive to live here, and by trading in the culture of the city to the tech mono-culture, the city is much worse for it.\n \nreply",

I talk about the Reno Hotel, a former nineteenth-century hotel that had been built for boxers, and the city had given it to artists and designers and said, You can live there, don\u2019t burn it down. And so they carved out these incredibly beautiful spaces for themselves. But this was before the tech revolution, when the Mission was still kind of wild and free, and it wasn\u2019t all the glass cubes and people in tech. It was a great city to live in then.

      "This has never stopped working for me - I interview every year or so as a matter of course.My experience helping others is that in a tightening labor market they are experiencing \"small fish in a big pond\" syndrome mentioned above.Compensation for the bottom 50-75% of talent has dropped significantly since 2021* - if you are in that band and chasing the same comp you're dealing with the \"small fish in a big pond\" situation. If these people drop their compensation expectations back to 2017 levels many of them will find jobs much more plentiful - though the very bottom of the pool is being driven out of the industry entirely.* this estimate pulled from conversations with engineering leaders and recruiters at large SV tech companies\n \nreply",
      "> If you re-read the transcript, I hope you will come to the understanding that this is a lie. The company is trying to leverage your desperation for a job.From the hiring side: It\u2019s not a lie at all, it\u2019s just that we have other serious candidates we also like. If you\u2019re not serious about taking the job then we need to move on to the next candidate quickly.Generally you can come back and ask if they\u2019ll re-issue the offer letter past the expiration. Most companies will happily do it if the position hasn\u2019t already been filled, but you may have to wait for their second-choice offer letter to also expire (see why the expiration dates exist? It\u2019s like locking a database row with a timeout added).In my experience, the candidates who want to extend out the negotiation process for weeks or even months are rarely serious about joining the company. Statistically they\u2019re a waste of time to continue holding up other hires.\n \nreply",

      "I think the first half of the article is the strongest, most plausible part. The argument:Economic opportunities for professional writers have declined dramatically. The two crucial pathways were mentioned for novel writers to support themselves economically: (1) magazine writing and (2) academia. In the first case, magazine circulation has suffered because advertisers left for the internet, and in the second case, academic job oportunities have declined because of governmental cutbacks to universities, especially in the humanities.The second half of the article argues that authors have made a tradeoff, deciding to maximize critical praise instead of book sales, thereby turning off general audiences who don't share the obscure and trendy tastes of the critics.This argument felt weak. As far as I can tell, there's no real explanation of how it supposedly came about. Even the article author seems to admit there are holes in the argument: \"There are still some important open questions: the exact role of the critics in moving authors away from popular taste.\" Indeed.I'm personally a fan of contemporary literary fiction. My own suspicion is that the problem in literature is the same as the problem in music and movies: corporate consolidation and the ascendancy of data-mongering penny-pinchers with no taste except for profit maximization. Their preference in all the arts is derivative dreck that's easily marketed, ideally with a built-in audience and reproducible, with the goal of spawning an endless series based in the same \"universe.\" The leaders of the industry don't want to take chances on new artists, unless they can guarantee a massive hit.\n \nreply",
      "Magazines were so flush with cash that Vonnegut was paid $750 for his first story. That's unadjusted for inflation.

He saw that market fall apart within his lifetime, and blamed it on th audience moving to TV, for what it's worth.\n \nreply",

      "I agree with you that the economic factors are much more persuasive.I'm curious though, if you're a reader of contemporary literary fiction, do you think that it hasn't undergone a transformation to become more obscure and trendy compared to where it was in, say, the 1960s? Are the critics' favorites now just as accessible and of the same standard as, say, Lolita or Portnoy's Complaint were back then? Or do you agree there was a transformation and just disagree with the vague reasons he gives for it?Also, do you have any recommendations of contemporary literary fiction for us here on Hacker News? Asking as someone who mostly only reads literary novels by dead people, contemporary sci-fi or speculative fiction, and of course, inevitably, books by Sally Rooney.\n \nreply",
      "> Books like Pride and Prejudice, War and Peace, The Brothers Karamazov, etc still sell many thousands of copies every year, more than even big hits in contemporary literary fiction.I think the author skips past the real answer right here. The old books haven\u2019t gone away. Even if we assume there are good new books, they have to compete with the supply of existing books, which grows without bound - unlike the time and attention of consumers.Every form of media has this problem. A human lifetime can only consume so many books, so many films, so many hours of music. A new movie comes out: what are the odds of it being more worth your while than one on the existing IMDb Top 1000? Decreasing.Books are no different. What are the odds that something new is going to displace something existing off the shortlist of greats that you already don\u2019t have time to read?\n \nreply",
      "This is all built on an assumption that arts/media can all be strictly ranked \u201cbest\u201d to \u201cworst.\u201d There are a million metrics by which we might try to measure it, but well\u2026 that\u2019s just not how art works. Thinking this way indicates a fundamental lack of understanding of what art is.\n Probably one of the most important metrics is \u201crelevance to, and effect on, the state of the world as it is right now.\u201d And pretty much any arbitrary \u201c1000 best\u201d list is not going to take that into account.That\u2019s why people listen to Chappell Roan, and near-instinctively belt her songs out out after a few drinks, instead of Beethoven symphonies or Mozart operas, even if the latter may be \u201csuperior\u201d in nearly every measurable way. Part of art is how it speaks to the listener. In fact\u2026 I might argue that that\u2019s all of art, with metrics about it being an entirely different, not-art thing.(I say all this as a classical musician and senior software engineer with a math background, myself.)\n \nreply",
