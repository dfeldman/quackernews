As dopamine plateaued, I barely just worked out a formula for a curve to spread the maximum snake length across a set number of levels so that it ends at 100% of gameplay area and remains winnable.

      "While I don't use the AI part I have a very similar scheme and it is one of the reasons I encourage people to live in the terminal.The idea is to create a modern \"terminal\"[0]My main computer is a Macbook Air, which I carry around with me. It's purpose is for: internet, using Microsoft products when I'm forced to, Zoom/meetings, and SSH (or Mosh).Most of my work is not done on this Macbook, instead I use it mostly as a terminal. I have a desktop that's sitting behind my TV so that it can be my TV and gaming system (yeah I know Monitor > TV. I'm a filthy casual and I don't care). I have a mouse connected to that computer and instead of using a keyboard I use ydotool (Wayland xdotool) with a shortcut on my iPhone or a script on my android phone or from my Macbook. I don't have to get up from the couch and I don't need a clunky wireless keyboard to clutter my livingroom.Additionally I have a few pis and an old android phone with Tailscale installed on them. That's come in handy before as a machine's been disconnected and so I couldn't ssh from outside. Also makes it really easy to do a jump if you want to keep a machine off Tailscale or you don't have full control (like my 3D printer).This setup is very natural feeling if you live in the terminal. I actually started doing this when I started doing HPC work. In a setting like that you're never sitting in front of the computer you're doing most of your work on so it kinda clicked \"why was I restricting myself outside work?\" Plus there's the side benefits of I always have access to my media, tools, and other stuff. You can do exactly the same thing with a phone but I like having a keyboard and the air is very lightweight and has a long battery life. Any netbook would have done the job tbh.[0] There's a reason they're called \"terminal emulators\" rather than just \"terminals\".reply"

      "There is a huge market segment waiting here. At least I think there is. Well, at least people like me want this. Ok, tens of dollars can be made at least. It is just missing a critical tipping point. Basically, I want an alexa like device for the home backed by local inference and storage with some standardized components identified:- the interactive devices - all the alexa/google/apple devices out there are this interface, also, probably some TV input that stays local and I can voice control. That kind of thing. It should have a good speaker and voice control. It probably should also do other things like act as a wifi range extender or be the router. That would actually be good. I would buy one for each room so no need for crazy antennas if they are close and can create true mesh network for me. But I digress.- the home 'cloud' server that is storage and control. This is a cheap CPU, a little ram and potentially a lot of storage. It should hold the 'apps' for my home and be the one place I can back-up everything about my network (including the network config!)- the inference engines. That is where this kind of repo/device combo comes in. I buy it and it knows how to advertise in a standard way its services and the controlling node connects it to the home devices. It would be great to just plug it in and go.Of course all of these could be combined but conceptually I want to be able to swap and mix and match at these levels so options here and interoperability is what really matters.I know a lot of (all of) these pieces exist, but they don't work well together. There isn't a simple standard 'buy this turn it on and pair with your local network' kind of plug and play environment.My core requirements are really privacy and that it starts taking over the unitaskers/plays well together with other things.

      "What bothers me about posts like this is: mid-level engineers are not tasked with atomic, greenfield projects. If all an engineer did all day was build apps from scratch, with no expectation that others may come along and extend, build on top of, or depend on, then sure, Opus 4.5 could replace them. The hard thing about engineering is not \"building a thing that works\", its building it the right way, in an easily understood way, in a way that's easily extensible.No doubt I could give Opus 4.5 \"build be a XYZ app\" and it will do well. But day to day, when I ask it \"build me this feature\" it uses strange abstractions, and often requires several attempts on my part to do it in the way I consider \"right\". Any non-technical person might read that and go \"if it works it works\" but any reasonable engineer will know that thats not enough.reply",
      "There are two types of right/wrong ways to build: the context specific right/wrong way to build something and an overly generalized engineer specific right/wrong way to build things.I've worked on teams where multiple engineers argued about the \"right\" way to build something. I remember thinking that they had biases based on past experiences and assumptions about what mattered. It usually took an outsider to proactively remind them what actually mattered to the business case.I remember cases where a team of engineers built something the \"right\" way but it turned out to be the wrong thing. (Well engineered thing no one ever used)Sometimes hacking something together messily to confirm it's the right thing to be building is the right way. Then making sure it's secure, then finally paying down some technical debt to make it more maintainable and extensible.Where I see real silly problems is when engineers over-engineer from the start before it's clear they are building the right thing, or when management never lets them clean up the code base to make it maintainable or extensible when it's clear it is the right thing.There's always a balance/tension, but it's when things go too far one way or another that I see avoidable failures.reply",

      "Their thesis is that code quality does not matter as it is now a cheap commodity. As long as it passes the tests today it's great. If we need to refactor the whole goddamn app tomorrow, no problem, we will just pay up the credits and do it in a few hours.reply",

      "It's way too early to make firm predictions here, but if you're not already in the field it's helpful to know there's been 20 years of effort at automating \"pen-testing\", and the specific subset of testing this project focused on (network pentesting --- as opposed to app pentesting, which targets specifically identified network applications) is already essentially fully automated.I would expect over the medium term agent platforms to trounce un-augmented human testing teams in basically all the \"routinized\" pentesting tasks --- network, web, mobile, source code reviews. There are too many aspects of the work that are just perfect fits for agent loops.reply",
      "It's not way too early, imo. This is the academic nerds proof of concept for a school research project, it's not the \"group of elite hackers get together and work out a world-class production ready system\".Agent platforms have similar modes of failure, whether it's creative writing, coding, web design, hacking, or any other sort of project scaffolding. A lot of recent research has dealt with resolving the underlying gaps in architectures and training processes, and they've had great success.I fully expect frontier labs to have generalized methodologizing capabilities withing the first half of the year, and by the end of the year, the Pro/Max/Heavy variants of the chatbots will have the capabilities baked in fully. Instead of having Codex or Artemis or Claude Code, you can just ask the model to think and plan your project, whatever the domain, and get professional class results, as if an expert human was orchestrating the project.All sorts of complex visual tool use like PCB design and building plans and 3d modeling have similar process abstractions, and the decomposition and specialized task executions are very similar in principle to the generalized skills I mentioned.

      "The app automated pentest scanners find the bottom 10-20% of vulns, no real pentester would consider them great. Agents might get us to 40%-50% range, what they are really good at is finding \"signals\" that the human should investigate.reply",

      "Honestly I'm just trying to be nice about it. I don't know that I can tell you a story about the 90% ceiling that makes any sense, especially since you can task 3 different high-caliber teams of senior software security people on an app and get 3 different (overlapping, but different) sets of vulnerabilities back. By the end of 2027, if you did a triangle test, 2:1 agents/humans or vice/versa, I don't think you'd be able to distinguish.Just registering the prediction.reply",
      "So the stuff that agents would excel at is essentially just the \"checklist\" part of the job?  Check A, B, C, possibly using tools X, Y, Z, possibly multi-step checks but everything still well-defined.Whereas finding novel exploits would still be the domain of human experts?reply",

I don't think you can do two network pentests and not immediately reach the conclusion that the need for humans to do significant chunks of that work at all is essentially a failure of automation.With more specificity: I would not be at all surprised if the \"industry standard\" netpen was 90%+ agent-mediated by the end of this year.

From least to most annoying:- display a static ad, have the \"x\" to close appear soon (3-10 seconds)- display an animated ad, have the \"x\" to close appear soon (3-10 seconds)- display a static ad, have the \"x\" to close appear after 20-30 seconds- display an animated ad, have the \"x\" to close appear after 20-30 seconds- display several ads in succession, each short, but it automatically proceeds to the next; the net time after which the \"x\" to close appears after 20-30 seconds- display several ads in succession, each lasts for 3-10 seconds but you have to click on an \"x\" to close each one before the next one appearsI live in the USA. The well-established consumer product brands (Clorox, McDonalds, etc.) almost all had short ads that were done in 3-5 seconds. The longest ads were for obscure games or websites, or for Temu, and they appeared over and over again, making me hate them with a flaming passion. The several-ads-in-succession were usually British newspaper websites (WHY???? I don't live there) or celebrity-interest websites (I have no interest in these).It seems like the monkey's-paw curse for this kind of legislation is to show several ads in a row, each allowing you to skip them after 5 seconds.reply",

I was also very early into my transition, so I was very in-the-loop with my trans collegeaues - and I heard about how one of the messenging teams (messenger? whatsapp? maybe both?) was going to be rolling out a trans pride flag emoji, and was encouraging early testing.My first and immediate find? Copy-and-pasting the emoji into any other text field would result in a singular unknown glyph (like, say, \ufffd) - these clowns wanted to map it to a private use area codepoint! Fair enough, I suppose, for a corporation that wishes to ship on their own timelines - so I did some digging.I found no good prior art to go off of - I believe that the eventually-accepted proposal was circulating as a draft at the time, but I haven't been able to find any references or records of it from that period of time; I did find reference here to the unicode consortium rejecting a proposal for a trans flag that year - I think it might have been an earlier version of the p"

This lead me to discover a vulnerability which allows reading memory out of bounds of the allocated string buffer. Although memory disclosure vulnerabilities have a serious impact, it is important to note that affected method is rarely used in real Ruby applications and very rarely would an attacker have control over the argument to the method call. The vulnerability affects Ruby 4.0.0 and prior, likely back as far as even Ruby 1.6.7 which was released in 2002. Follow the progress of the fix in PR #15763.The vulnerability exists within the instance method pack of the Array class.\nThe pack method accepts a template string argument, which it uses to determine how to convert the array's elements into a binary string.\nA template string is comprised of directives, where a directive is typically a single letter, such as \"H\" to"

It feels very different.In 2024 I was looking for a place to see the eclipse, and someone I knew from a forum 20 years ago told me I could come to his house, as it was going right over it. It was my first time meeting him in person, despite having known him for 20 years. We don\u2019t talk as often anymore, but for many years we talked everyday. I probably talked to him more than anyone else I knew for a good 5-10 years. I don\u2019t feel like that stuff happens when people are just blasting out memes.reply",
      "That sort of connection making is happening in varying degrees of private discord servers today. You join the public discord it, you spend time with strangers, if you're likeable you eventually get told about less advertised public servers, or invite-only servers, and you go down a bit of a rabbit hole of loosely interconnected communities. Eventually you find communities that you settle into.Good filters make for good communities. 20 years ago, being on the internet at all was pre-selecting for certain types of people. That's basically not true anymore. Today, the filters end up being invite systems.reply",
      "I guess that\u2019s sort of what happened with the forums. I was on a decently large one and eventually became a mod. Then a bunch of the mods and admins had their own smaller forums. I ended up being an admin on several of those. Over the years there were migrations and things.However, nothing was \u201cprivate\u201d. Some of the smaller forums still had members who never found their way to the bigger hub forum.I\u2019ve never used Discord and the idea of starting that process and everything being like prohibition era speakeasies is more than I want to deal with at this stage of life. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I always had the impression that Discord was for voice chat? I liked that forums didn\u2019t required everyone to be online at the same time.

      "Algorithmic curation is something I'm trying to avoid in all cases. I think it's not highlighted enough. The fact that youtube shows an infinite number of videos to choose from does its own sort of harm in a way that the specifics of the content cannot.When the internet was brand new, it was very novel that I had to go out seeking the content and could look at it any time I wanted. It was different than TV. TV was enjoyed passively and you just watched what they showed you. The early internet was so much better it's hard to describe. It was a purely active experience. Algorithmic curation is a return to the TV model. Someone else decides what you should watch, and you passively observe it materialize in front of you. Try this for an experience. log out of youtube, install some filters in uBlock Origin which prevent all algorithmic results (even on the home page and in search results) and then try to think of what you'd like to watch. For some of you out there, I'll bet this feels like exercising an old, unused muscle. You used to do this kind of querying all the time. But scan your mind. What possibilities are there to view? It feels emptier than it should.reply",
      "Agree. I also use Unhook/Brave to remove all recommendations plus my DeCasino to grayscale social media and put a clock over. I only watch subscriptions - clicking from subscriptions bar, not the feed. My phone is fully grayscale, no notifications and only has Brave with custom content filter that removes the main feed as well. It's almost impossible to watch anything on my phone but a video from a direct link. Sounds kind of crazy, but it's finally sustainable.As a result, I have zero curated feeds, and I only follow people that I chose and started taking more word-of-mouth suggestions. I've noticed that I got much more interested in politics and my internet time is now all meaningful. Algorithms do steer us, they aren't neutral.reply"
