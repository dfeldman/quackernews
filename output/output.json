      "The most surprising part of uv's success to me isn't Rust at all, it's how much speed we \"unlocked\" just by finally treating Python packaging as a well-specified systems problem instead of a pile of historical accidents. If uv had been written in Go or even highly optimized CPython, but with the same design decisions (PEP 517/518/621/658 focus, HTTP range tricks, aggressive wheel-first strategy, ignoring obviously defensive upper bounds, etc.), I strongly suspect we'd be debating a 1.3\u00d7 vs 1.5\u00d7 speedup instead of a 10\u00d7 headline \u2014 but the conversation here keeps collapsing back to \"Rust rewrite good/bad.\" That feels like cargo-culting the toolchain instead of asking the uncomfortable question: why did it take a greenfield project to give Python the package manager behavior people clearly wanted for the last decade?reply",
      "It's not just greenfield-ness but the fact it's a commercial endeavor (even if the code is open-source).Building a commercial product means you pay money (or something they equally value) to people to do your bidding. You don't have to worry about politics, licensing, and all the usual FOSS-related drama. You pay them to set their opinions aside and build what you want, not what they want (and if that doesn't work, it just means you need to offer more money).In this case it's a company that believes they can make a \"good\" package manager they can sell/monetize somehow and so built that \"good\" package manager. Turns out it's at least good enough that other people now like it too.This would never work in a FOSS world because the project will be stuck in endless planning as everyone will have an opinion on how it should be done and nothing will actually get done.Similar story with systemd - all the bitching you hear about it (to this day!) is the stuff that would've happened during its development phase had it been developed as a typical FOSS project and ultimately made it go nowhere - but instead it's one guy that just did what he wanted and shared it with the world, and enough other people liked it and started building upon it.reply",

      "Office politics happen when people determine they can get more money by engaging in politics instead of working.

      "I largely agree but don't want to entirely discount the effect that using a compiled language had.At least in my limited experience, the selling point with the most traction is that you don't already need a working python install to get UV.  And once you have UV, you can just go!If I had a dollar for every time I've helped somebody untangle the mess of python environment libraries created by an undocumented mix of python delivered through the distributions package management versus native pip versus manually installed...At least on paper, both poetry and UV have a pretty similar feature set. You do however need a working python environment to install and use poetry though.reply",
      "1000% this. uv is trivially installable and is completely unrelated to installations of python.reply",

The usual explanation is \u201cit\u2019s written in Rust.\u201d That\u2019s true, but it doesn\u2019t explain much. Plenty of tools are written in Rust without being notably fast. The interesting question is what design decisions made the difference.Charlie Marsh\u2019s Jane Street talk and a Xebia engineering deep-dive cover the technical details well. The interesting parts are the design decisions: standards that enable fast paths, things uv drops that pip supports, and optimizations that don\u2019t require Rust at all.pip\u2019s slowness isn\u2019t a failure of implementation. For years, Python packaging required executing code to find out what a package needed.The problem was setup.py. You couldn\u2019t know a package\u2019s dependencies without running its setup script.

      "Text is just bytes, and bytes are just text.  I assume this is talking about human readable ASCII specifically.I think the obsession with text comes down to two factors: conflating binary data with closed standards and poor tooling support.  Text implies a baseline level of acceptable mediocrity for both.  Consider a CSV file will millions of base64 encoded columns and no column labels.  That would really not be any friendlier than a binary file with a openly documented format and suitable editing tool, e.g. sqlite.Maybe a lack of fundamental technical skills is another culprit, but binary files really aren't that scary.reply",
      "I agree. As a simple exercise, look at all software tools that\u2019s GUI only. They become a large walled garden unable to be penetrated by LLM.Tools that are mostly text or have text interfaces? Greatly improved by LLM.So all of those rich multimedia and their players/editors really need to add text representations.reply",
      "I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, I agree: text is infinitely versatile, indexable, durable, etc. But, after discovering Bret Victor's work[1], and thinking about how I learned piano, I've also started to see a lot of the limitations of text. When I learned piano, I always had a live feedback loop: play a note, and hear how it sounds, and every week I had a teacher coach me. This is a completely different way to learn a skill, and something that doesn't work well with text.Bret Victor's point is why is this not also the approach we use for other topics, like engineering? There are many people who do not have a strong symbolic intuition, and so being able to tap into their (and our) other intuitions is a very powerful tool to increase efficiency of communication. More and more, I have found myself in this alternate philosophy of education and knowledge transmission. There are certainly limits\u2014and text isn't going anywhere, but I think there's still a lot more to discover and try.[1] https://dynamicland.org/2014/The_Humane_Representation_of_Th...reply",
      "I think the downside, at least near-term, or maybe challenge would be the better word, is that anything richer than text requires a lot more engineering to make it useful. B\u266d is text. Most of the applications on your computer, including but not limited to your browser, know how to render B\u266d and C\u266f, and your brain does the rest.Bret Victor's work involves a ton of really challenging heavy lifting. You walk away from a Bret Victor presentation inspired, but also intimidated by the work put in, and the work required to do anything similar. When you separate his ideas from the work he puts in to perfect the implementation and presentation, the ideas by themselves don't seem to do much.Which doesn't mean they're bad ideas, but it might mean that anybody hoping to get the most out of them should understand the investment that is required to bring them to fruition, and people with less to invest should stick with other approaches.reply",
      "For a computer, text is a binary format like anything else. We have decades of tooling built on handling linear streams of text where we sometimes encode higher dimensional structures in it.But I can't help feel that we  try to jam everything into that format because that's what's already ubiquitous. Reminds me of how every hobby OS is a copy of some Unix/Posix system.If we had a more general structured format would we say the opposite?reply",

Example author gives is about for a recipe for making banana bread, that if you\u2019re familiar with bananas, it\u2019s obvious that you need to peel them before mashing. Bit of you haven\u2019t seen a banana, you\u2019d have no clue what to do. Does a recipe say peel a banana or should that be ignored?

Yes, they represent a tiny fraction of 1% of the global population, but they do exist. And the beauty of text is that this level of nuance can be conveyed, a simplistic, inaccurate, broad brush approach is not needed.\nNor is it the oldest form of communication. Having recently started exploring the cave art record, the text informs me that this is at least an upper middle single digit multiple of the age of text.\nYes, a picture paints a thousand words, which can then be interpreted a thousand ways.\nText has the ability to convey precise, accurate, objective information, it does not, as this article demonstrates, necessarily do so.reply",

Nothing gets closer to the mythical silver-bullet that developers have been chasing since the birth of the industry.The holy grail of programming has been staring us in the face for decades and yet we still keep inventing new data structures and complex tools to transfer data... All to save like 30% bandwidth; an advantage which is almost fully cancelled out anyway after you GZIP the base64 string which most HTTP servers do automatically anyway.Same story with ProtoBuf. All this complexity is added to make everything binary. For what goal? Did anyone ever ask this question? To save 20% bandwidth, which, again is an advantage lost after GZIP... For the negligible added CPU cost of deserialization, you completely lose human readability.In this industry, there are tools and abstractions which are not given the respect they deserve and the humble string is definitely one of them.reply",

      "So, about one mushroom species in five is poisonous. Why is the ratio so low, why are there lots of edible ones? Without hard-shelled seeds to spread, why be eaten? And the poisonous ones apparently don't use color as a warning signal, and don't smell all that bad, and some of the poisons have really mild effects, like \"gives only some people diarrhea\" or \"makes a hangover worse\". Meanwhile three of the deadliest species seemed to need their toxin (amanitin) so much that they picked it up through horizontal gene transfer. Why did just those ones need to be deadly? In addition to which we have these species that don't even make you sick, just make you trip out, a function which looks to have evolved three times over in different ways. What kind of half-assed evolutionary strategies are these? What do mushrooms want?reply",
      "It's really fucking suspicious that mushrooms evolved mechanisms to produce serotonin.But it helps when you remember that a mushroom is the fruit of a (usually) much larger organism. Then you can start applying normal fruit rules. Some want to be eaten, or picked up and moved around. Some want to keep insects from infesting the fruit. Others don't give a damn and release spores into the wind or water.Also remember that nicotine is an insecticide. Insects that nibble on tobacco die, which prevents infestation at scale. (Un?)fortunately it's also neuroactive in apes, so we farm incredible quantities of tobacco to extract its poisons.There is no logic in evolution at large scales. Things happen, sometimes there's fourth order effects like some oddball internal hormone causing wild hallucinations in apes. It's all random optimization for small scale problems that ripple out to unintended large scale consequences.reply",
      "Two things:0) Humans (and even our recent ancestors) eating you are a very recent thing to be concerned about, numbers-wise. By the time our numbers were enough to provide evolutionary pressure, we started farming what we wanted, which kinda breaks the process. Also. most poisons don't effect everything equally, so what might prevent a horse from eating you might taste delicious to us (like the nightshade family) or even be sought after for other reasons, like capsaicin.1) You're succumbing to the usual evolution fallacy. Evolution doesn't want anything more than 1 and 1 want to be 2. It's just a process, and sometimes (hell maybe even often) it doesn't work in a linear fashion. Lots of \"X steps back, Y steps forward\", and oftentimes each of those steps can take anything from decades to centuries or more to make, and by the time it happens what was pressuring that change is gone.So many people, even when they obviously know better, like to think of evolution as intelligent. It's obviously not. But every time someone says stuff like this, it reinforces the fallacy and then we get people saying things like \"if evolution is real, why come $insane_argument_against_evolution?\"reply",
      "While your objection is technically correct it can still be useful (ie simple, straightforward, etc) to phrase things in terms of a goal. Since a goal (pursued by an intelligent being) and optimization pressure (a property of a blind process) are approximately the same thing in the end. In other words, Anthropomorphization can be useful despite not being true in a literal sense.Certainly this can be misleading to the layman. The term \"observer\" in quantum mechanics suffers similarly.reply",
      "No.\"Optimization pressure\" makes it sound as if there is a single metric for optimization, whereas there are a constantly shifting set of different metrics. Worse (or more precisely, more complex) there are frequently multiple different \"solutions\" for a given metric, and evolution doesn't care. Put a little differently, there is no \"optimization\" pressure at all: evolution is not attempting to optimize anything (*).Trying to fit anthropomorphized design onto a process that is absolutely the opposite of that in every way (no intent, multiple outcomes, no optimization) just leads people to not think clearly about this sort of thing.(*) no, not even \"reproductive fitness\" - rates of reproduction are subject to massive amounts of environmental \"noise\", to the degree that minor improvements in offspring survivability will often be invisible over anything other than the very long term. Further, the most desirable rates of reproduction will also vary over time, leading to what once may have appeared to be an improvement into a liability (and vice versa, of course).reply",
      "Right. It's extremely unlikely that \"unable to synthesize Vitamin C\" would ever have actively been selected for. But it was also unlikely to be strongly selected against in any version of humans or their near ancestors which have access to basically any common food.So, randomly this pathway is deleted in our species, but there won't be a satisfying \"just so\" explanation, it's just blind luck. I happen to think we should fix it, most people either don't care or believe we shouldn't.reply",
      "Framed in anthropomorphized terms this would look something like the goal of humans as a species is not the synthesis of vitamin C but rather mere survival. Walking a path where we come to depend on external sources is not necessarily at odds with that.Or more generally: Why did I do that specific thing? No particular reason, it just happened to work. After all, I managed not to fall off the platform for another few seconds. No telling what the future will bring.As long as we're thinking about anthropomorphization it's amusing to note that vitamin C synthesis can be framed as a species level tragedy of the commons. In that case you are simply advocating that we as a species make the responsible choice not to participate in a race to the bottom!reply",
      "You're being overly literal. It's not \"trying to fit anthropomorphized design onto a process\" but rather \"using anthropomorphization as a descriptive tool\". This situation is not unlike when someone takes issue with an analogy due to erroneously interpreting it as a direct comparison.> here are frequently multiple different \"solutions\" for a given metricSo too are there multiple different options when working towards any nontrivial goal in the real world. In the context of stochastic optimization the multi-armed bandit problem is a rather well known concept.> evolution is not attempting to optimize anythingFor the purpose of communication (of some other idea) it could be reasonable to say that the human race merely wants survival first and foremost. That is what evolution is after, at least in a sense. Of course that is not technically correct. Pointing out technical inconsistencies isn't going to convince me that I'm in the wrong here because I've already explicitly acknowledged their presence and explained why as far as I'm concerned objecting to them is simply missing the point.Switching to a technical angle, to claim that evolution is not optimizing is to claim that water doesn't flow downhill but rather molecules just happen to vibrate and move around at random. It's completely ignoring the broader context. Evolution happens at a species level. It's an abstract concept inherently tied to other abstract concepts such as optimization and survival.reply",
      "and you are missing my point that trying to help people understand a process that has no design element as if it was one that did actually does them (and the process) a disservice, possibly a great disservice.reply",
      "A more intuitive and natural phrasing, even though it's invalid in a technical sense. I've noticed this happens when people talk about computers/software as well (\"it thinks the variable is set\", \"it freaks out if it doesn't get a response\", etc). Outside of formal writing/presentations, using only technical terminology seems to take a suboptimal amount of effort for both speaker and listener compared to anthropomorphizing (unless, as you mention, the listener is a layman who gets the wrong idea).reply"

If you go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_families#Spok... and sort the list by number of current speakers (which adds up to far more than the population of the world because so many people speak two or more languages), you'll find the top five language families are Indo-European (which includes most European languages, including English), Sino-Tibetan (which includes Chinese), Atlantic-Congo (which includes Bantu and many other languages spoken in Africa, most of which you probably won't have heard of unless you're a linguist or you live in Africa), Afroasiatic (which includes Arabic), and Austronesian (which includes Tagalog, which you might know by the name Filipino).It might be possible to claim that the Afroasiatic languages are all derived from Arabic, but the only influence that the Arabic language has had on Indo-European languages such as English is via loanwords (like algebra, for example). This does not make English a derivative of Arabic any more than Japanese (which has borrowed several English words such as \u30ab\u30e1\u30e9, \"kamera\", from camera) is a derivative of English. Borrowing a word, or even a few dozen words, from another language does not make it a derivative. English, while it gleefully borrows loanwords from everywhere, is derived from French and German (or, to be more accurate, from Anglo-Norman and Proto-Germanic).reply"

The term is centered on calling the region, to oversimplify, an underdeveloped poor rural backwater.Just because Pennsylvania has a larger chunk of land that some would describe that way than Council Bluffs does doesn't inherently change that both terms are demeaning.I haven't been to Council Bluffs, but I have spent time in parts of Pennsylvania outside the Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and State College metros, and while I'm not going to proclaim wisdom without having lived there I certainly saw where the term and stereotype came from.reply",

      "> I then decided to contact Insulet to get the kernel source code for it, being GPLv2 licensed, they're obligated to provide it.This is technically not true.  It is an oversimplification of the common case, but what actually normally should happen is that:1. The GPL requires the company to send the user a written offer of source code.2. The user uses this offer to request the source code from the company.3. If the user does not receive the source code, the user can sue the company for not honoring its promises, i.e. the offer of source code.  This is not a GPL violation; it is a straight contract violation; the contract in this case being the explicit offer of source code, and not the GPL.Note that all this is completely off the rails if the user does not receive a written offer of source code in the first place.  In this case, the user has no right to source code, since the user did not receive an offer for source code.However, the copyright holders can immediately sue the company for violating the GPL, since the company did not send a written offer of source code to the user.  It does not matter if the company does or does not send the source code to the user; the fact that the company did not send a written offer to the user in the first place is by itself a GPL violation.(IANAL)reply",

The spirit of the GPLv2 was about contributing software improvements back to the community.Which brings us to the question: what is this guy going to do with (presumably) the kernel source? Force the Chinese to contribute back their improvements to the kernel? Of which there are likely none. Try and run custom software on his medical device which can likely kill him? More than likely.The judge's comments on the Vizio case are such that should this guy get his hands on the code, he has no right to modify/reinstall it AND expect it will continue to operate as an insulin pump.This is about as ridiculous as buying a ticket on an airplane and thinking you are entitled to the source code of the Linux in-seat entertainment system.reply",

And I'd trust my life to open source in such a setting long before I'd do it to closed source.

They releasing chemicals to lower immune activity in order to protect themselves, so the idea that we had these for thousands of years and basically are made to have them is intriguing.

      "> I can create hypothetical cases for either location to be higher or lower than the other.- Transmission is easier in the city due to closer contact and more shared resources.- Urban parasites are likely to be more debilitating to the victim because they may come from an unfamiliar environment. (Compare how hookworm in the American south was a nuisance to blacks, but debilitating to whites.)We know that diseases were a much heavier burden in cities than they were in rural regions. Parasites are mostly just bigger diseases; you'd need to come up with a really interesting idea to explain why they were a smaller issue in cities than outside of them.Hookworm is an interesting example to consider here; you catch them by stepping on soil with your bare feet. Stereotypically they are a problem of the rural south. But I found this paper on \"neglected tropical diseases\" in the United States, which had this to say:> Toxocariasis is a soil-transmitted helminth infection [it isn't hookworm, but hookworm is also a soil-transmitted helminth infection] that can result in visceral larva migrans, visual impairment from ocular larval migrans, or a condition that resembles asthma, known as covert toxocariasis. Urban playgrounds in the US have recently been shown to be a particularly rich source of Toxocara eggs, and inner-city children are at high risk of acquiring the infection.https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journa...Another example to consider might be covid, where my read of the consensus is that (1) initial nature -> human infection is more likely in rural areas (where there's more nature), but (2) once it can live in humans, it's a bigger problem in urban areas (where there are more humans).reply",

Continually updating a To Read list, mostly by going to Barnes and Noble, taking pictures of featured book tables, then adding the interesting ones to my Libby hold list.4.

(I probably should have read it slower; by the last two books, I was just flowing with the text, not paying as much attention to the overarching plot.)Heinlein's \"Orphans of the Sky\" was pretty bad. So much early scifi is considered great because it's groundbreaking, writing about things nobody else has before. The concept of a generation ship was pretty new at the time Heinlein was writing it, and it has some very interesting concepts, but the book has some really bad problems. If you've read it, you know; if you haven't, and decide to, you'll see it for yourself.I binged a few Brandon Sanderson books. The standalones are great; the Stormlight Archive is a huge slog through some beautiful writing, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend so much time in beautiful books that move the plot forward so slowly.Exordia, by Seth Dickinson, started off incredible, kept going, but the ending felt like both a fizzle as well as a cliff-hanger for the next book. I'm glad I read it, but I wish it had a clear conclusion it wanted to reach.Adrian Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Memory\" delivers more of the great philosophical questions & answers about the nature of consciousness and personhood that the previous books did, A+. No idea where he could possibly go from there, but if he does, I'm going along for the journey. (Honorable mention: Alien Clay.

    "first_paragraph": "When a computer defeated the world champion at chess in 1996, it could select the best moves but needed a person to move the pieces. Twenty years later, when AlphaGo defeated the world champion in Go, it still could not move the pieces on its own. Today, LLMs can solve gold medal IMO problems, but can't write down the answer with a pencil. This mismatch between our expectations about how hard something is for us and how hard it is for machines is called Moravec's paradox. Seemingly hard problems like playing chess, solving math problems, or planning routes through congested streets to minimize travel time are \"easy\" for machines, whereas seemingly easy problems like picking up a chess piece, writing a note, making a peanut butter sandwich, or washing the dishes present exceptionally difficult challenges.Underlining this paradox, Benjie Holson proposed a set of \"Robot Olympics\" challenge tasks in a recent blog post, with seemingly simple everyday behaviors like spreading peanut butter, "

      "Cool! And I do think the world needs more C compilers. There is so much you could do with this language, but it needs to be disentangled from the C++ compiler behemoths. (yes, I now that there are other small C compilers)reply",
      "There is the TCC. Adapting that would probably be a faster path to a full featured C compiler on esp32 than building up my xcc700. This is more of an educational sandbox project.reply",
      "I know, and there are chibicc, kefir, etc.  .. and I have my own experimental C compiler.reply",
      "I would love to see how you handle variably-modified types, the way I retrofitted them onto chibicc never felt quite right, and I've never seen another non-gcc/clang compiler fully support noplate's VM type patterns.reply",
      "Cool, always refreshing to see different approaches to the same problem, and you learn so much by doing, this is more the kind of tinkering I will be doing in retirement.reply",
      "That's super cool! I have been wondering what could be done with ESP32 if it weren't for the lack of RAM.As a fun of Rust, one thing that saddens me is knowing these things would be difficult to achieve with a Rust compiler, given the language seems to be vastly more complex.Unless someone created a subset of Rust without (some?) safety checks, I guess.reply",
      "Right, Rust is more complex, and it is the complex bits that make it Rust. There are sure some shortcuts possible for starters, for example scope-based lifetimes like in early Rust versions, but still, to make it a worthwhile upgrade over C, it would take some intermediate representation, and definitely more than 700 lines.There is a lively movement for coding in Rust for esp32, that works, just not on the device I think.reply",
      "hats off. this is really easy to read and well written and easy to comprehend code imho because it only support basic features. its a really nice example to read through thanks. nice inspiration to see its possible to roll your own for this with a bit restricted featureset and goals :).reply",
      "This one[1] is similar in style and supports a bit more C constructs. [1] https://github.com/Lulzx/sectorc/blob/master/stage5/cc.creply",
      "Very cool! What was the shell you are running in the demo video?reply"

Please reload this page.\nThere was an error while loading. Please reload this page.Note: that timing is from esp32-s3. Timings on Mac/POSIX will be reported 1000x slower than they are, as on esp32 ticks are millisecond, and on POSIX microsecond, but there is no adjustment here..Several options:A. Compile with gcc xcc700.c and run it on your computer as a cross-compiler. It is fairly portable, tested on Mac x86_64 and arm64.B. Compile for esp32 using xtensa-gcc or xcc700 from the option A (yes it can compile and cross-compile itself). Or grab the gcc-compiled version here: xcc700.elf (16kB). Run with ESP-IDF elf_loader.C.

We all know the adage about judging book covers, but here, \u2026it just kinda works. Skip over the sites with bright flashy colors begging for attention and instead, seek out the negative space in between.The one nitpick I have though is in how they sourced the websites. They used the most popular websites from Common Crawl which is fine, but not really what I\u2019m interested in\u2026There are of course exceptions, but the relationship between popularity and quality is loose. McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t popular because it serves the best cheeseburger, it\u2019s popular because it serves a cheeseburger that meets the minimum level of satisfaction for the maximum number of people. It\u2019s a profit maximizing local minima on the cheeseburger landscape.This isn\u2019t limited to just food either, the NYT Best Sellers list, Spotify Top 50, and Amazon review volume are other good examples. For me, what"
