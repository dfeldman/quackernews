      "Would be interesting to train a cutting edge model with a cut off date of say 1900 and then prompt it about QM and relativity with some added context.If the model comes up with anything even remotely correct it would be quite a strong evidence that LLMs are a path to something bigger if not then I think it is time to go back to the drawing board.reply",
      "You would find things in there that were already close to QM and relativity. The Michelson-Morley experiment was 1887 and Lorentz transformations came along in 1889. The photoelectric effect (which Einstein explained in terms of photons in 1905) was also discovered in 1887. William Clifford (who _died_ in 1889) had notions that foreshadowed general relativity: \"Riemann, and more specifically Clifford, conjectured that forces and matter might be local irregularities in the curvature of space, and in this they were strikingly prophetic, though for their pains they were dismissed at the time as visionaries.\" - Banesh Hoffmann (1973)Things don't happen all of a sudden, and being able to see all the scientific papers of the era its possible those could have fallen out of the synthesis.reply",
      "I presume that's what the parent post is trying to get at? Seeing if, given the cutting edge scientific knowledge of the day, the LLM is able to synthesis all it into a workable theory of QM by making the necessary connections and (quantum...) leapsStanding on the shoulders of giants, as it werereply",
      "But that's not the OP's challenge, he said \"if the model comes up with anything even remotely correct.\" The point is there were things already \"remotely correct\" out there in 1900. If the LLM finds them, it wouldn't \"be quite a strong evidence that LLMs are a path to something bigger.\"reply",
      "It's not the comment which is illogical, it's your (mis)interpretation of it. What I (and seemingly others) took it to mean is basically could an LLM do Einstein's job? Could it weave together all those loose threads into a coherent new way of understanding the physical world? If so, AGI can't be far behind.reply",
      "This alone still wouldn't be a clear demonstration that AGI is around the corner. It's quite possible a LLM could've done Einstein's job, if Einstein's job was truly just synthesising already available information into a coherent new whole. (I couldn't say, I don't know enough of the physics landscape of the day to claim either way.)It's still unclear whether this process could be merely continued, seeded only with new physical data, in order to keep progressing beyond that point, \"forever\", or at least for as long as we imagine humans will continue to go on making scientific progress.reply",
      "Einstein is chosen in such contexts because he's the paradigmatic paradigm-shifter. Basically, what you're saying is: \"I don't know enough history of science to confirm this incredibly high opinion on Einstein's achievements.  It could just be that everyone's been wrong about him, and if I'd really get down and dirty, and learn the facts at hand, I might even prove it.\"  Einstein is chosen to avoid exactly this kind of nit-picking.reply",
      "No, by saying this, I am not downplaying Einstein's sizeable achievements nor trying to imply everyone was wrong about him. His was an impressive breadth of knowledge and mathematical prowess and there's no denying this.However, what I'm saying is not mere nitpicking either. It is precisely because of my belief in Einstein's extraordinary abilities that I find it unconvincing that an LLM being able to recombine the extant written physics-related building blocks of 1900, with its practically infinite reading speed, necessarily demonstrates comparable capabilities to Einstein.The essence of the question is this: would Einstein, having been granted eternal youth and a neverending source of data on physical phenomena, be able to innovate forever? Would an LLM?My position is that even if an LLM is able to synthesise special relativity given 1900 knowledge, this doesn't necessarily mean that a positive answer to the first question implies a positive answer to the second.reply",
      "They can also choose Euler or Gauss.These two are so above everyone else in the mathematical world that most people would struggle for weeks or even months to understand something they did in a couple of minutes.There's no \"get down and dirty\" shortcut with them  =)reply",
      "This does make me think about Kuhn's concept of scientific revolutions and paradigms, and that paradigms are incommensurate with one another. Since new paradigms can't be proven or disproven by the rules of the old paradigm, if an LLM could independently discover paradigm shifts similar to moving from Newtonian gravity to general relativity, then we have empirical evidence of an LLM performing a feature of general intelligence.However, you could also argue that it's actually empirical evidence that general relativity and 19th century physics wasn't truly a paradigm shift -- you could have 'derived' it from previous data -- that the LLM has actually proven something about structurally similarities between those paradigms, not that it's demonstrating general intelligence...reply"

They work well on a medium scale, where goods are fungible and efficiency matters: but for something like the local pizza place, customer behaviour doesn't match that of a market participant. I don't think it's sensible to expect the local pizza place to be free of arbitrage opportunities. Someone who identifies and exploits such opportunities (e.g. \"free meals available on request\") would be taking advantage of goodwill, and the reason we can't have nice things.

      "Current leader of the Large Text Compression Benchmark is NNCP (compression using neural networks), also by Fabrice Bellard:https://bellard.org/nncp/Also, nncp-2024-06-05.tar.gz is just 1180969 bytes, unlike ts_zip-2024-03-02.tar.gz (159228453 bytes, which is bigger than uncompressed enwiki8).reply",
      "Looks like it beats everything in the large text compression benchmark for enwik8, but loses to several programs for enwik9. I wonder why that is.reply",
      "It's actually not the best at enwik8 or 9.The results at https://www.mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html explicitly add the size of the compressor itself to the result. Note the \"enwik9+prog\" column. That's what it's ranked on.The reason to do this is that it's trivial to create a compressor that 'compresses' a file to 0 bytes. Just have an executable with a dictionary of enwik9 that writes that out given any input. So we always measure what is effectively the Kolmogorov complexity. The data+program as a whole that produces the result we want.So those results add in the compressor size. The programs there generally have no dictionary built in or in the case of LLM based compressors, no pre-trained data. They effectively build the model as they process data. Not compressing much at all at the start and slowly compressing better and better as they go. This is why these programs do better and better with larger data sets. They start with 0 knowledge. After a GB or so they have very good knowledge of the corpus of human language.This program here however is pre-trained and shipped with a model. It's 150MB in size! This means it has 150MB of extra starting knowledge over those models in that list. The top models in that list are the better compressors, they'll quickly out learn and overtake this compressor but they just don't have that headstart.Of course measuring fairly this should be listed with that 150MB program size added to the results when doing a comparison.reply",
      "As an aside, I wonder how to account for the information content embedded in the hardware itself.A Turing Machine compressor program would likely have more bytes than the amd64 binary. So how to evaluate KolmogorovComplexity(amd64)?The laws of physics somehow need to be accounted for too, probably.reply",

      "Reminded me of pi filesystem (https://github.com/philipl/pifs), with enough digits of pi precalculated you might be able to do a decent compression program. The trick is in the amount of reasonable digits for that, if it\u2019s smaller or bigger than that trained LLM.reply",
      "I suspect that the length of the offset of your input data in pi is equal to the length of the input data itself, plus or minus a few bytes at most, regardless of the size of the input data.That is: no compression, but it won't make things worse either.Unless the input data is the digits of pi, obviously, or the result of some computation involving pi.reply",
      "You could express the offset with scientific notation, tetration, and other big math number things. You probably don't need the whole offset number all at once!reply",
      "I'm going to be the nerd that points out that it has not been mathematically proven that pi contains every substring, so the pifs might not work even in theory (besides being utterly impractical, of course).On a more serious note, as far as I understand these compression competitions require that static data is included in the size computation. So if you compress 1000 MB into 500 MB, but to decompress you need a 1 MB binary and a 100 MB initial dictionary, your score would be 500 + 100 + 1 = 601 MB, not 500 MB.The relevance to this discussion is that the LLM weights would have to be included as static data, since the only way to regenerate them is from the initial training data, which is much larger than the resulting model. By comparison, pi based compression is the other way around: since pi is a natural constant, if your decompressor requires (say) a trillion digits of pi, you could write a relatively small program (a few kb) to generate them. It would be terribly slow, but it wouldn't affect your compression ratio much.reply",
      "> I'm going to be the nerd that points out that it has not been mathematically proven that pi contains every substring, so the pifs might not work even in theory (besides being utterly impractical, of course).Well, either your program 'works', or you will have discovered a major new insight about Pi.> On a more serious note, as far as I understand these compression competitions require that static data is included in the size computation.

Then you wouldn't necessarily need to include the size of the compressor and decompressor in the score.Of course, it would be utterly impractical to sample Gigabytes of new text each time you need to run the benchmark: humans are expensive writers.  The only way this could work would be either to sample via an LLM, but that's somewhat circular and wouldn't measure what you actually want to measure in the benchmark, or you could try to keep the benchmark text secret, but that has its own problems.reply"

      "I did marine biology field work almost 5 decades ago as a lowly junior lab tech. Work always has downsides, for me it was not really the Scots winter, cold feed, chapped hands, the land-rover having to reverse up steep icy roads to get back from the harbourside: it was washing the glassware and dealing with sodium hydroxide weighing (it absorbs moisture from the air so its a fools game). But, field work also brought amazing experiences, I visited the seaside 70+ times over a year, and got an insight into what a time series really means when you cover the tidal and weather and seasonal cycles.It's also always error-prone. Nothing in the field is perfect. Reality is a bad approximation for your model at times, if you take a model centric view.I would be immensely skeptical that field work is ever going away.

      "This article lists several of the absurdities of the Date constructor, but only barely touches on the most unforgivable one. The example from the article is:  // Unless, of course, you separate the year, month, and date with hyphens.\n  // Then it gets the _day_ wrong.\n  console.log( new Date('2026-01-02') );\n  // Result: Date Thu Jan 01 2026 19:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)\n\nIn this example, the day is \"wrong\" because the constructor input is being interpreted as midnight UTC on January 2nd, and at that instantaneous point in time, it is 7pm on January 1st in Eastern Standard Time (which is the author's local time zone).What's actually happening here is a comedy of errors. JavaScript is interpreting that particular string format (\"YYYY-MM-DD\") as an ISO 8601 date-only form. ISO 8601 specifies that if no time zone designator is provided, the time is assumed to be in local time. The ES5 spec authors intended to match ISO 8601 behavior, but somehow accidentally changed this to 'The value of an absent time zone offset is \u201cZ\u201d' (UTC).Years later, they had realized their mistakes, and attempted to correct it in ES2015. And you can probably predict what happened. When browsers shipped the correct behavior, they got too many reports about websites which were relying on the previous incorrect behavior. So it got completely rolled back, sacrificed to the altar of \"web compatibility.\"For more info, see the \"Broken Parser\" section towards the bottom of this article:https://maggiepint.com/2017/04/11/fixing-javascript-date-web...reply",
      ">So it got completely rolled back, sacrificed to the altar of \"web compatibility.\"This is why I don't understand the lack of directives.'use strict'; at the top of a file was ubiquitous for a long time and it worked. It didn't force rolling back incompatibilities, it let you opt into a stricter parsing of JavaScript.It would have been nice for other wide changes like this to have like a 'strict datetime'; directive which would opt you into using this corrected behavior.They couldn't and shouldn't do this sort of thing for all changes, but for really major changes to the platform this would be an improvement.Or they could go all in on internal modules, like how you can import `node:fs` now. They could include corrected versions of globals like`import Date from 'browser:date';`has corrected behavior, for examplereply",
      "To be fair, the new opt-in \"use strict\" here is \"switch to Temporal\". It's a new, stricter namespace object. Old Date code gets the old Date code quirks, new code gets the nice new Temporal API.Internal modules would be handy in theory to maybe keep from having to dig through a thesaurus every time browsers decide to add a new, stricter version of an older API. Internal modules have even been proposed to TC-39 as a recommended way to continue to expand the JS API. Last I checked on that proposal it was stuck behind several concerns including:1. Feature detection: detecting if Temporal available is as easy as `if ('Temporal' in globalThis) {}`, but detecting if a module import is missing is a bit harder. Right now the standard is that loading a module fails with an Error if one of its imports fails. You can work around that by doing a dynamic import inside a try/catch, but that's a lot of extra boilerplate compared to `const thingINeed = 'someApi' in globalThis ? someApi() : someApiPolyfill()`. I've seen  multiple proposals on that front from extensions to import maps and `with { }` options on the import itself.2. Bikeshedding (and lots of it): defining a URI scheme like `browser:` or `standard:` takes a bunch of thought on how you expand it. If it is just `browser:some-api` you run the risk of eventually polluting all the easy names in the exact way people worry about the risk of over-polluting `globalThis` (and in the way that it can be weirdly hard to find an available one-word name on npm), you've just moved the naming problem from one place to the other. On the other side, if you go down the road of something like `es-standard:https://tc39.es/ecma262/2025/v1/final-draft/Temporal`, even (especially) assuming users would mostly importmap that to something shorter you've recreated XMLNS URIs in a funny new hat and people who use JS all certainly have plenty of opinions on XMLNS URIs, many are very vocal in their hatred of it, but also they came out of a strong backwards incompatibility fixing desire exactly like this.

      "I always found it weird when systems code dates as DateTime strings. There needs to be a different primitive for Date, which is inherently timezone-less, and DateTime, which does require a timezone.After having a bunch of problems with dealing with Dates coded as DateTime, I've begun coding dates as a Date primitive, and wrote functions for calculation between dates ensuring that timezone never creeps its way into it. If there is ever a DateTime string in a Date column in the database, it's impossible to know what the date was supposed to be unless you know you normalized it at some point on the way up.Then I found that a lot of DatePicker libraries, despite being in \"DATE\" picker mode, will still append a local timezone to its value. So I had to write a sanitizer for stripping out the TZ before sending up to the server.That said, I am pretty excited about Temporal, it'll still make other things easier.reply",

      "You reminded me of some riddle I had once read that was about trying to figure out how someone could be born one year later but still be older than someone born in previous year.

Thirty minutes later, another baby is born in Los Angeles, where the local time is 9:45 PM on December 31. Although the New York baby is actually older by 30 minutes, the calendar dates make it appear as though the Los Angeles baby was born first.reply"

In other projects I\u2019ve maintained a LLVM pass that worked across multiple llvm versions and it was straightforward to do.- LICM register pressure is a big issue especially when the source isn\u2019t C or C++.

      "> It knows how to rematerializeThat's very cool, I didn't realize that.> but the backend is generally more local/has less visibility than the optimizerI don't really buy that. It's operating on SSA, so it has exactly the same view as LICM in practice (to my knowledge LICM doesn't cross function boundary).LICM can't possibly know the cost of hoisting. Regalloc does have decent visibility into cost. Hence why this feels like a regalloc remat problem to mereply",
      "> to my knowledge LICM doesn't cross function boundaryLICM is called with runOnLoop() but is called after function inlining. Inlining enlarges functions, possibly revealing more invariants.reply",
      "Sure. Any pass that is scoped to functions (or even loops, or basic blocks) will have increased scope if run after inlining, and most passes run after inlining.In the context of this thread, your observation is not meaningful. The point is: LICM doesn't cross function boundary and neither does regalloc, so LICM has no greater scope than regalloc.reply",
      "\"LLVM IR is actually remarkably stable these days.\"I'm by no means an LLVM expert but my take away from when I played with it a couple of years ago was that it is more like the union of different languages. Every tool\nand component in the LLVM universe had its own set of rules and requirements for the LLVM IR that it understands. The IR is more like a common vocabulary than a common language.My bewilderment about LLVM IR not being stable between versions had given way to understanding that this freedom was necessary.Do you think I misunderstood?reply",
      "> like the union of different languagesNo. Here are two good ways to think about it:1. It's the C programming language represented as SSA form and with some of the UB in the C spec given a strict definition.2. It's a low level representation. It's suitable for lowering other languages to. Theoretically, you could lower anything to it since it's Turing-complete. Practically, it's only suitable for lowering sufficiently statically-typed languages to it.> Every tool and component in the LLVM universe had its own set of rules and requirements for the LLVM IR that it understands.Definitely not. All of those tools have a shared understanding of what happens when LLVM executes on a particular target and data layout.The only flexibility is that you're allowed to alter some of the semantics on a per-target and per-datalayout basis. Targets have limited power to change semantics (for example, they cannot change what \"add\" means). Data layout is its own IR, and that IR has its own semantics - and everything that deals with LLVM IR has to deal with the data layout \"IR\" and has to understand it the same way.> My bewilderment about LLVM IR not being stable between versions had given way to understanding that this freedom was necessary.Not parsing this statement very well, but bottom line: LLVM IR is remarkably stable because of Hyrum's law within the LLVM project's repository. There's a TON of code in LLVM that deals with LLVM IR. So, it's super hard to change even the smallest things about how LLVM IR works or what it means, because any such change would surely break at least one of the many things in the LLVM project's repo.reply",
      "> 1. It's the C programming language represented as SSA form and with some of the UB in the C spec given a strict definition.This is becoming steadily less true over time, as LLVM IR is growing somewhat more divorced from C/C++, but that's probably a good way to start thinking about it if you're comfortable with C's corner case semantics.(In terms of frontends, I've seen \"Rust needs/wants this\" as much as Clang these days, and Flang and Julia are also pretty relevant for some things.)There's currently a working group in LLVM on building better, LLVM-based semantics, and the current topic du jour of that WG is a byte type proposal.reply",
      "> This is becoming steadily less true over time, as LLVM IR is growing somewhat more divorced from C/C++, but that's probably a good way to start thinking about it if you're comfortable with C's corner case semantics.First of all, you're right. I'm going to reply with amusing pedantry but I'm not really disagreeingI feel like in some ways LLVM is becoming more like C-in-SSA...> and the current topic du jour of that WG is a byte type proposal.That's a case of becoming more like C! C has pointer provenance and the idea that byte copies can copy \"more\" than just the 8 bits, somehow.(The C provenance proposal may be in a state where it's not officially part of the spec - I'm not sure exactly - but it's effectively part of the language in the sense that a lot of us already consider it to be part of the language.)reply",
      "The C pointer provenance is still in TS form and is largely constructed by trying to retroactively justify the semantics of existing compilers (which all follow some form of pointer provenance, just not necessarily coherently). This is still an area where we have a decent idea of what we want the semantics to be but it's challenging to come up with a working formalization.I'd have to double-check, but my recollection is that the current TS doesn't actually require that you be able to implement user-written memcpy, rather it's just something that the authors threw their hands up and said \"we hope compilers support this, but we can't specify how.\" In that sense, byte type is going beyond what C does.reply"

Of course, not all of these issues are of equal importance, and how important they are depends on who you ask. In the interest of brevity, I will mostly just explain what the problem is, and not discuss what possible solutions would be.Finally, I should probably point out that this is written from my perspective as the lead maintainer of the LLVM project: This is not a list of reasons to not use LLVM, it\u2019s a list of opportunities to improve LLVM.Unlike many other open-source projects, LLVM certainly does not suffer from a lack of contributors.

For example, I might say something like this:    I'm building a mount for our baby monitor that I can attach to the side of the changing table. The pins are x mm in diameter and are y mm apart. [Image #1] of the mounting pins. So what needs to happen is that the pin head has to be large, and the body of the pin needs to be narrow. Also, add a little bit of a flare to the bottom and top so they don't just knocked off the rest of the mount.\n\nAnd then I'll iterate.    We need a bit of slop in the measurements there because it's too tight.\n\nAnd so on. I'll do little bits that I want and see if they look right before asking the LLM to union it to the main structure. It knows how to use OpenSCAD to generate preview PNGs and inspect it.Amusingly, I did this just a couple of weeks ago and that's how I learned what a chamfer is: a flat angled transition. The adjustment I needed to make to my pins where they are flared (but at a constant angle) is a chamfer. Claude told me this as it edited the OpenSCAD file.

This (in the mid 90s, before Java, JavaScript, and C++ TR1) was also my first contact with associative arrays.I was also drawn to the style of the Camel Book.More than most other languages, Perl encouraged one-liners.

In python, the \"not\" operator is just the word not, and can write \"not not 12\" to get True. They didn't implement a special \"not not\" operator, anymore than Perl implemented a \"!!\" operator. They just implemented the basic ! / \"not\" operator.reply",

You just add zero to a value that's coercible into a number.The Eskimo operators are also interesting: similar to a SQL injection attack, you use a close brace and an open brace to stop and start a new code block from within a string that's sent to the interpreter. Perl didn't invent open and close braces: hence the verb \"discover\" rather than \"implement\".The whole page is a bit of a lark, and a good example of why some of us don't enjoy Perl!reply"

      "The writing was on the wall the moment Apple stopped trying to buy their way into the server-side training game like what three years ago?Apple has the best edge inference silicon in the world (neural engine), but they have effectively zero presence in a training datacenter. They simply do not have the TPU pods or the H100 clusters to train a frontier model like Gemini 2.5 or 3.0 from scratch without burning 10 years of cash flow.To me, this deal is about the bill of materials for intelligence. Apple admitted that the cost of training SOTA models is a capex heavy-lift they don't want to own. Seems like they are pivoting to becoming the premium \"last mile\" delivery network for someone else's intelligence. Am I missing the elephant in the room?It's a  smart move. Let Google burn the gigawatts training the trillion parameter model. Apple will just optimize the quantization and run the distilled version on the private cloud compute nodes.

      "> I'm oversimplifying but this effectively turns the iPhone into a dumb terminal for Google's brain, wrapped in Apple's privacy theater.Setting aside the obligatory HN dig at the end, LLMs are now commodities and the least important component of the intelligence system Apple is building. The hidden-in-plain-sight thing Apple is doing is exposing all app data as context and all app capabilities as skills. (See App Intents, Core Spotlight, Siri Shortcuts, etc.)Anyone with an understanding of Apple's rabid aversion to being bound by a single supplier understands that they've tested this integration with all foundation models, that they can swap Google out for another vendor at any time, and that they have a long-term plan to eliminate this dependency as well.> Apple admitted that the cost of training SOTA models is a capex heavy-lift they don't want to own.I'd be interested in a citation for this (Apple introduced two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models in 2025), but in any case anything you hear from Apple publicly is what they want you to think for the next few quarters, vs. an indicator of what their actual 5-, 10-, and 20-year plans are.reply",

I tried a couple more times until I changed up to saying \"Navigate me to Costco\" where it finally did the search in the textbox and found it for me.Obviously this isn't the same thing as Gemini but the experience with Android Auto becomes more and more garbage as time passes and I'm concerned that now we're going to have 2 google product voice assistants.Also, tbh, Gemini was great a month ago but since then it's become total garbage.

      "They did not. Anthropic is protecting its huge asset: the Claude Code value chain, which has proven itself to be a winner among devs (me included, after trying everything under the sun in 2025). If anything, Anthropic's mistake is that they are incapable of monetizing their great models in the chat market, where ChatGPT reigns: ie. Anthropic did not invest in image generation, Google did and Gemini has a shot at the market now.Apparently nobody gets the Anthropic move: they are only good at coding and that's a very thin layer. Opencode and other tools are game for collecting inputs and outputs that can later be used to train their own models - not necessarily being done now, but they could - Cursor did it. Also Opencode makes it all easily swappable, just eval something by popping another API key and let's see if Codex or GLM can replicate the CC solution. Oh, it does! So let's cancel Claude and save big bucks!Even though CC the agent supports external providers (via the ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL env var), they are working hard on making it impossible for other models to support their every increasing agent feature set (skills, teleport and remote sessions, LSP, Chrome integration, etc). The move totally makes sense, like it or not.reply",
      "This is really not the point. Anthropic isn\u2019t cutting off third-party. You can use their models via API all you want. Why are people conflating this issue? Anthropic doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything to offer their \u201cunlimited\u201d pro tiers outside of Claude Code. It\u2019s not hard to build your own Opencode and use API keys. CLI interface by itself is not a moat.reply",
      "People should take this as a lesson on how much we are being subsidized right now.Claude code runs into use limitations for everyone at every tier. The API is too expensive to use and it's _still_ subsidized.I keep repeating myself but no one seems to listen: quadratic attention means LLMs will always cost astronomically more than you expect after running the pilot project.Going from 10k loc to 100k loc isn't a 10x increase, it's a 99x increase. Going from 10k loc to 1m loc isn't a 100x increase, it's a 9999x increase. This is fundamental to how transformers work and is the _best case scenario_. In practice things are worse.reply",
      "I don't see LLMs ingesting the LoCs. I see CC finding and grepping and reading file contents piecewise, precisely because it is too expensive to ingest a whole project.So what you say is not true: cost does not directly correlate with LoC.reply",
      ">Claude code runs into use limitations for everyone at every tierWhat do you mean by this? I know plenty of people who never hit the upgraded Opus 4.5 limits anymore even on the $100 plan, even those who used to hit the limits on the $200 plan w/ Opus 4 and Opus 4.1.>The API is too expensive to use and it's _still_ subsidized.What do you mean by saying the API is subsidized? Anthropic is a private company that isn't required to (and doesn't) report detailed public financial statements. The company operating at a loss doesn't mean all inference is operating at a loss, it means that the company is spending an enormous amount of money on R&D. The fact that the net loss is shrinking over time tells us that the inference is producing net profit over time. In this business, there is enormous up front cost to train a model. That model then goes on to generate initially large, but subsequently gradually diminishing revenue until the model is deprecated. That said, at any given snapshot-in-time, while there is likely large ongoing R&D expenditure on the next model causing the overall net profit for the entire company to still be negative, it's entirely possible that several, if not many or even most of the previously trained models have fully recouped their training costs in inference revenue.It's fairly obvious that the monthly subscriptions are subsidized to gain market share the same way Uber rides were on early on, but what indication do you have that the PAYG API is being subsidized? How would total losses have shrunk from $5.6B in 2024 to just $3B in 2025 while ARR grew from ~$1B to ~$7B over the same time period (one where usage of the platform dramatically expanded) if PAYG API inference wasn't running at a net profit for the company?reply",
      "> Also Opencode makes it all easily swappableIt's all easily swappable without OpenCode. Just symlink CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md and run `codex` instead of `claude`.> they are working hard on making it impossible for other models to support their every increasing agent feature set (skills, teleport and remote sessions, LSP, Chrome integration, etc).Every feature you listed has an open-source MCP server implementation, which means every agent that supports MCP already has all those features. MCP is so epic because it has already nailed the commodification coffin firmly shut. Besides, Anthropic has way less funding than OAI or Google. They wouldn't win the moat-building race even if there were one.That said, the conventional wisdom is that lowering switching costs benefits the underdogs, because the incumbents have more market share to lose.reply",
      "> ie. Anthropic did not invest in image generation, Google did and Gemini has a shot at the market now.They're after the enterprise market - where office / workspace + app + directory integration, security, safety, compliance etc. are more important. 80% of their revenue is from enterprise - less churn, much higher revenue per W/token, better margins, better $/user.Microsoft adopting the Anthropic models into copilot and Azure - despite being a large and early OpenAI investor - is a much bigger win than yet another image model used to make memes for users who balk at spending $20 per month.Same with the office connector - which is only available to enterprises[0] (further speaking to where their focus is). There hasn't yet been a \"claude code\" moment for office productivity, but Anthropic are the closest to it.[0] This may be a mistake as Claude Code has been adopted from the ground upreply",

They give away the store to casual users, but make it so that a business will want to talk to sales to get all the features they need with better pricing per user.  Small businesses can survive quite well on the free plan.reply",
      "Agreed. The system is ALL about who controls the customer relationship.If Anthropic ended up in a position that they had to beg various Client providers to be integrated (properly) and had to compete with other LLMs on the same clients and could be swapped out at a moment's notice, they would just become a commodity and lose all leverage. They don't want to end up in such situation. They do need to control the delivery of the product end-to-end to ensure that they control the customer relationship and the quality.This is also going to be KEY in terms of democratizing the AI industry for small startups because this model of ai-outside-tools-inside provides an alternative to tools-outside-ai-inside platforms like Lovable, Base44 and Replit which don't leave as much flexibility in terms of swapping out tooling.reply"

To understand why, let's briefly rewind to 2025, the year when agentic AI went mainstream.On 3 February 2025, Andrej Karpathy coined the term \"vibe coding\" to describe the new paradigm.Less than three weeks later, Anthropic released the first research preview of Claude Code, bringing large language models directly into developers' native habitat: the terminal.OpenAI followed with Codex CLI in April, and Google released Gemini CLI in June.All of these terminal-based coding agents follow the same principle:These steps are repeated in a loop, but with a twist: the agent can continue working through the loop until the LLM decides that it requires user input.The principle is so simple that it immediately gave rise to a bunch of alternative coding agents, including OpenCode, Roo, and Amp Code (to name but a few).\nEach brought its own unique philosophy and approach to the table, but wha"

      "100% uptime is impossible of course, a 100% reliable service would survive the next ice age.But reliability at the holy grails of 4 and 5 nines (99.99%, 99.999% uptime) means ever greater investment - geographically dispersing your service, distributed systems, dealing with clock drift, multi master, eventual consistency, replication, sharding.. it\u2019s a long list.Questions to ask: could you do better yourself - with the resources you have? Is it worth the investment of a migration to get there? Whats the payoff period for that extra sliver of uptime? Will it cost you in focus over the longer term? Is the extra uptime worth all those costs?reply",

      "The process where resources accrue to those with more resources is called the Matthew Effect. It explains, amongst other things, why the degree distribution of social networks follows a power law.There's a nice experimental test of this where showing the number of previous downloads a song has makes it more likely to be downloaded (but not to the extent that it entirely overrides the quality of the song.\n<https://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full....>reply",
      "I agree that financial inequality in tennis is real and unfair \u2014 and the point about \u201cescape velocity\u201d at the top is compelling. Once players cross a certain income threshold, they\u2019re not just better rewarded, they\u2019re structurally harder to displace.I\u2019d add another layer, though, which interacts with that dynamic rather than replacing it: entry barriers. For players from peripheral regions of the tennis ecosystem (e.g., South America), the climb is not only underfunded but structurally hostile \u2014 long travel distances, fewer high-value tournaments, language barriers, and competing almost permanently as the outsider. These factors affect who even gets a chance to reach escape velocity in the first place, and they\u2019ve existed long before today\u2019s prize-money explosion.That raises a deeper question the article hints at but doesn\u2019t fully address: what do we actually mean by fairness in elite sport?Is it equal opportunity, or is it preserving a brutally selective system that produces exceptional performers?There\u2019s a real tension here. Some pressure is clearly wasteful \u2014 forcing talented players to play injured, burn out early, or leave the sport before they peak. But some pressure is also constitutive of excellence. Scarcity, risk, and high stakes shape psychology, decision-making, and competitive edge. A system with no tension doesn\u2019t produce champions; a violin string without tension is out of tune.So the problem may not be inequality per se, but which inequalities entrench incumbents versus which ones meaningfully select for performance. Reducing attrition that destroys talent before it matures is different from flattening the incentives and risks that keep the top level sharp.For that reason, I\u2019m not convinced the solution is primarily redistributive \u2014 \u201ccutting the cake differently.\u201d A more promising direction may be using the top tier to leverage the bottom tier: expanding global sponsorship, regional tournaments, media exposure, and off-court revenue opportunities that help more players reach viability without removing the competitive pressures that define elite tennis.In other words, grow the cake and widen access to escape velocity \u2014 rather than trying to engineer fairness in a system whose excellence is partly forged by difficulty.reply",
      "An interesting article to revisit 8+ years later.Now, in 2026, men's tennis is dominated by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, both under 25 years of ageAlso, I don't think women's tennis has shown the same cartel effect in the top 5 or top 10 as men's tennis has recently.  It seems like there's much more churn there, and many more young players, though I haven't measured this and maybe it's just a feeling.reply",
      "To quote McEnroe, commentating Wimbledon this year: \"Father Time, undefeated.\" Djokovic is mentioned in the article and has only just ended his dominant era, and is still ranked 4th in the world at 38. So we did get some very long runs in there, and I would imagine just 3 years ago or so people would have expected some mid to late 20s/early 30s guys like Zverev or Fritz to be having their turn. Both of whom, some asterisks.Instead we got this young duo / lightning in a bottle situation; and I expect that both Sinner and Alcaraz are likely to be playing dominantly into their mid 30s barring injury, or maybe Alcaraz buying a nightclub in Ibiza and retiring.reply",
      "A possible factor on your observation is females athletically peaking earlier.Edit. A quick investigation shows there is not a significant age difference between men and women for both top 10 player lists and top 100 player listsreply",
      "Or just that younger women are hotter so they attract more of an audience.reply",
      "Lol. I didn\u2019t realize how important audience following was to winning tennis matches.reply",
      "Pretty important! More fans mean more sponsorship dollars, which mean better coaches, food, &c, which means better conditioning and training for the match, and thus a higher chance of winning and getting more fans and more sponsorship cycles.I actually think it\u2019s great. The level playing field can get a bit overrated. Hungary entrepreneurs will intuitively understand the parallels.reply",
      "That was my first thought, but then again, players with a large fan base are more likely to get a wildcard into an event they don't directly qualify for.reply",
      "I know nothing about tennis, but I think the general point still stands.Any time you have a system with feedback loops and economies of scale / network effects, the natural iterated behavior over time is an increasingly steep power law distribution.With the digital world where zero marginal costs mean huge economies of scale and social interaction means huge network effects, we are clearly seeing a world dominated by a small number of insanely powerful elites. Seven of the ten richest people in 2025 got there from tech.Our society wasn't meant to be this connected with this much automated popularity aggregation. It leads to huge inequality until we figure out damping or counterbalancing systems to deal with it.reply"
