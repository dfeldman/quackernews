      "> I should hope that the purpose of a class writing exercise is not to create an artifact of text but force the student to think; a language model produces the former, not the latter.It's been incredibly blackpilling seeing how many intelligent professionals and academics don't understand this, especially in education and academia.They see work as the mere production of output, without ever thinking about how that work builds knowledge and skills and experience.Students who know least of all and don't understand the purpose of writing or problem solving or the limitations of LLMs are currently wasting years of their lives letting LLMs pull them along as they cheat themselves out of an education, sometimes spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to let their brains atrophy only to get a piece of paper and face the real world where problems get massively more open-ended and LLMs massively decline in meeting the required quality of problem solving.Anyone who actually struggles to solve problems and learn themselves is going to have massive advantages in the long term.\n \nreply",

They believe, rightfully and accurately, that the university degree is yet another part of the machine that they will become a cog in.What should be alarming to everyone is that these students will graduate without having learned anything and then go into the workplace where they will continue to not use their atrophied critical thinking skills, to simply do yet more, as a cog in the machine.\n \nreply",
      "This attitude is part of a more general cultural shift. Back in the 1960s, the majority of students said the primary motivation for going to college was to develop a philosophy of life, and a minority said the main goal was to be very financially successful. Somewhere around the 1980s this started to shift and the proportions are now inverted.* according to the UCLA CIRP freshman survey\n \nreply",
      "> Somewhere around the 1980s this started to shift and the proportions are now inverted.Yeah, that's when the great \"push for education\" came, as well as neoliberalism which preached continuous hustling and individuality. And in the 90s, the ADA \nand other anti discrimination laws hit, and requiring a college degree was and still is a very useful pre-screening filter for HR to continue discrimination.\n \nreply",
      "If students went to college only to learn, colleges wouldn't bother giving diplomas.Compare: My piano teacher doesn't give diplomas because none of her students would care, her students actually want to learn. When my piano teacher cancels class, I am disappointed because I wanted to learn. My piano teacher doesn't need to threaten me with bad grades to get me to practice outside of class (analogous to homework), because I actually want to learn.There are many college students for whom none of these tests would pass. They would not attend if there was no diploma, they're relieved when their professors cancel class, and they need to be bullied into studying outside of class.What made us think these students were ever interested in learning in the first place? Instead, it seems more likely that they just want a degree because they believe that a degree will give them an advantage in the job market. Many people will never use the information that they  supposedly learn in college, and they're aware of this when they enroll.Personally, the fact that they can now get a degree with even less wasted effort than before doesn't bother me one bit. People who want to learn still have every opportunity to.\n \nreply",
      "I think LLMs, if used correctly, can be useful for BOTH the credentialing and the human resource development (*cough*)Essentially, since they are a summary of \"the\" state of knowledge, the teacher should be able to ask them to put a number on how novel a piece of text is.Once LLMs are able to evaluate, independently, the soundness of an argument...

      "> The reason a teacher asks you a question is not because they don\u2019t know the answer.A decent amount of my professors don't know the answers because they bought the course, test questions, and lectures from Cengage. During exam review, they just regurgitate the answer justification that Cengage provided. During the lectures, they struggle to explain certain concepts since they didn't make the slides.Professors automate themselves out of the teaching process and are upset when students automate themselves out of the learning process.I can tell when the faculty views teaching as a checkbox that they officially have to devote 40% of their time to. I can tell when we are given busywork to waste our time instead of something challenging.To use your analogy, I'm being told to move 1000 plush reproductions of barbells from Point A to B by hand because accreditation wants to see students \"working out\" and the school doesn't want high failure rates.We are all pulling out the forklift. Some of us are happy because we don't have to work as hard. Others are using the forklift so we can get in a real workout at home, as school is not a good use of our time. Either way, none of us see value moving paperweights all day.My favourite course during my Computer Engineering degree was Science Fiction because that professor graded us on substance instead of form. It was considered a hard class, but one can easily get good marks on the essays by focusing on high quality and substantive points instead of strict adherence to the form of a five-paragraph hamburger essay.\n \nreply",

If I wanted to learn and engage with material, I could save $60,000 and do that online for free, probably more efficiently. The purpose of a class writing exercise is to get the university to give me the degree, which I cannot do by actually learning the material (and which, for classes I care about, I may have already done without those exercises), but can only do by going through the hoops that professors set up and paying the massive tuition cost. If there were a different system where I could just actually learn something (which probably wouldn't be through the inefficient and antiquated university system) and then get a valid certificate of employability for having actually learned it, that would be great. Unfortunately, however, as long as university professors are gatekeepers of the coveted certificate of employability, they're going to keep dealing with this incentive issue.\n \nreply",

      "Great article. This is all above the skill level of the average part on thingiverse or printables, but the good parts on there are going to follow similar ideas. Love the mouse ears, press-fit holes and step-by-step alignment of layers to build impossible bridges.Notably, in fusion 360 this would all be designed in \"plastics\" mode, and yet that mode is oblivious to whether the part is printed or moulded. I wonder if any CAD engine can do \"production-aware design\" that constrains design to the capabilities of standardized machines, e.g. keeping a metal part 3-d millable. I've seen strict design rule enforcement with PCBs, and I have seen sheet metal macros, but nothing for general mechanical CAD.\n \nreply",
      "> I wonder if any CAD engine can do \"production-aware design\" that constrains design to the capabilities of standardized machinesAt this time, none that I'm aware of. I am considering some manner of FreeCAD workbench that would integrate slicing to allow specific printing techniques to be applied to specific features of the part. I'm still not sure exactly what it would look like or integrate into the workflow yet.\n \nreply",
      "I've investigated this space, and I'm not entirely sure its even a desired goal from the perspective of a mechanical designer. The benefit tends to be for smaller aspects (ensuring hole sizes are appropriate for the desired thread, or that holes aren't too close to a bend line on a sheet metal part, etc) but the final design of a 3d part is so non-deterministic, and the variety of manufacturing methods are so varied and unique, it might just cause more issues than benefits.\n \nreply",
      "Totally just spitballing, I know nothing about this.Thinking about the problem, it seems like it would be extremely difficult to come up with a set of design rules that cover everything somebody might want to print.But would it be possible to literally simulate the printing process? Maybe using some kind of CFD code? I mean, for arbitrary designs this could get really complex. But, there\u2019s a hard limit\u2014the thing actually has to get printed, which is a slow mechanical layer-by-layer process, and the end result has to fit in the print chamber, haha.\n \nreply",
      "The people I've talked to found it similarly unnecessary. But mainly because they weren't able to imagine a good implementation.\"But what if I want to do x\" is what I heard the most. Like, sure, if you want to make your part on a 3-axis router and then drill one sideways hole, then put that in the markup. CAD always seems to have a feature stack, so apply a 3-axis design rule and discard it before the last step. Similar for multiple setups on a mill, or for surface treatment.The gold standard still seems to be a signed and printed drawing that is never complete and full of implications. Mapping a design to a factory, or even pricing it, is  an art form that has resisted automation. I expected this to change with all the \"industry 4.0\" push from ten years ago, but somehow that just meant adding wi-fi.\n \nreply",
      "There are DFM tools that you can use on the back end of your design process e.g. through fictiv/protolabs etc. However there is a lot of stuff that is \"technically machineable\" but way more expensive to do, and it really is an engineer's job to both understand how the part is made, talk to the machinists if they don't, and to trade off the design complexity vs. the engineering needs.\n \nreply",

      "> Cut threads into printed parts with a thread tap for quick design of low-reuse joints.I've found wood screws work well for this. The wood screw can cut its own threads without needing to use a tap.It does put some stress on the part, though. I mostly print in PETG, which is strong enough; but PLA might split if the hole was parallel to the layers.> A design limitation of threaded inserts is that they are not reliably usable for screws inserted from the back side. During insertion, heat-set inserts often push some molten plastic into the hole beneath them, preventing easy insertion of a screw from the back side.A trick I sometimes use:1. Before installing the insert, insert the screw from the back side2. Screw the insert onto the protruding screw3. Use a soldering iron to install the insert+screw together into the plasticBecause the screw is filling the hole, the molten plastic can't block the hole. Instead, the molten plastic forms itself around the screw, and it acts like a Nyloc nut.\n \nreply",
      "This looks so good. I\u2019ve gotten into 3D printing in the past six months with an A1 Mini. I initially bought it intending solely to do creative projects with my kid, but I\u2019ve been surprised to find myself getting deeper into printing functional parts. I recently printed a 6\u201d server rack for a GLi.net Beryl and Apple TV for travel, from a combination of pre-designed and self-designed parts.3D printing as a pursuit can be time-consuming - there\u2019s always a risk with these things that you take them on as a dilettante and they end up gathering dust in a corner. I initially scraped by with some middling Blender skills (leaning into non-destructive operations where possible), but that is far from ideal - you really do need CAD. But to anyone considering jumping in, I would say: if you get an A1 (get the full size, not the Mini) and use Claude to write your parametric OpenSCAD scripts, the time commitment is such that you can _just about_ indulge in this hobby as a dilettante - eg, as a project for your kids. Without LLMs, I think it would be too much of a commitment unless you\u2019re really dedicated, or already have CAD skills.Anyway, gonna go read this in full.\n \nreply",

I can now easily look at those pictures and remember my past in a way that I simply couldn\u2019t beforehand.This has been an unbelievable improvement in QoL through an improved self-identity, remembrance of my past, and reconnection with memories of lost loved ones.I can agree with the author on the disruptive nature of picture taking.

It's to develop better habits and better relationships with what we use to enhance our lives.  Because that's the point: to enhance our lives, not to diminish them.  If you feel that your tech is diminishing your life, that's probably a sign that you need to re-examine how you use it.  Throwing it away entirely is a wasteful response that might \"fix\" the diminishing effects, but will also deprive you of the enhancements.Before smartphones (and/or decent camera phones), I used to carry a small point-and-shoot digital camera with me nearly everywhere.

      "This is an update from the folks doing Thunderscope (a high frequency \"soft\" oscilloscope) but this really stands out:Teaching KiCad a New Trick - Matching DelaysAt time of writing, KiCad only understands the length of traces and pins. When length matching, it takes length as a single number added up across every layer. This leads to delay mismatches, as the signals on the inner layers are slower than the signals on the outer layers. When assigning pin lengths, you need to arbitrarily choose a layer to convert a delay value (given by the manufacturer), to a length. This also results in delay mismatches.I wanted to do this right, just like Altium does, but I didn\u2019t want to have to calculate and add up all the delay values by hand in a spreadsheet. So I made a script to rewrite custom design rules to try to get KiCad\u2019s length matching to be delay matching (including pad delays).Closed source design tools leave you stuck, and often when a need like this surfaces you end up paying a lot of money for an \"option pack\" that adds the capability. If you have ever wondered if KiCad was up to doing any kind of design, this should assure you that no it works just fine and you can kick that $10,000 Altium license to the curb.\n \nreply",
      "The quote does say that Altium does it out of the box though? With KiCad you had to write a script and learn how the format works. Could also be introduced as a patch to upstream and have everyone benefit from it, but that's less time spent working on the circuit\n \nreply",

      "What the author does not really discuss here is the discipline of troops. While some armies were highly disciplined and would not be deterred by a hail of arrows with a single digit probability of being killed or disabled, I imagine it would be a pretty big deterrent for your average conscripted peasant. These are people who likely have no formal training, very little personal stake in the outcome of the battle, and the crappiest protection. Even with modern firearms, most shots fired are not killing enemy combatants, they are suppressing fire that pin down professional soldiers, making it difficult to complete their objectives, and certainly slowing them down. Maybe the smart play when faced with a barrage of arrows is to close the distance as quickly as possible and jump on the archers, but again if you are just some guy who has never so much as seen a battle before, I imagine it would be next to impossible to fight the instinct to try and hunker down behind some cover. Throw in the fact that archers can't maintain a high rate of fire for long, and the archers are almost certainly either armed for melee combat, or defended by soldiers who are, and it makes some real sense to try and get the enemy to waste shots while you are at long range, and conversely for the archers to hold their fire and wait until the enemy gets closer. There would also undoubtedly be a large variety in strategy depending on who you're fighting.For the Persians, for example, who were mostly fighting various disorganized tribes, it makes a lot of sense that they would find a lot of success with a large archer force. It also makes sense when the Persians came up against comparatively disciplined and well armored Greeks that they would be able to close the gap with minimal casualties.\n \nreply",

      "One thing not said here is that samplers have no access to model's internal state. It's basic math applied to the output distribution, which technically carries some semantics but you can't decode it without being as smart as the model itself.Certain samplers described here like repetition penalty or DRY are just like this - the model could repeat itself in a myriad of ways, the only way to prevent all of them is better training, not n-gram search or other classic NLP methods. This is basically trying to plug every hole with a finger. How many fingers do you have?Hacking the autoregressive process has some some low-hanging fruits like Min-P that can make some improvement and certain nifty tricks possible, but if you're doing it to turn a bad model into a good one, you're doing it wrong.\n \nreply",

      "No, it's done to turn an uncreative model into a creative model. This idea that sampling isn't that important or is some violation of the bitter lesson is exactly why I had to call out the whole academic field as having a giant blindspot for this kind of research in our oral presentation at ICLR!Top n sigma has been around since mid 2024, min_p around since 2023 and we are still waiting for these innovations to be integrated outside of open source stuff (i.e. outside of HF/vllm). It's being done slowly on purpose by API providers because they don't want to deal with the risk of models being \"too creative\" (also high temp likely breaks their watermarking)One other thing - making models aware of their own sampling settings is super easy if you just feed it back to the model every token or generation (say, using structured generation). Models can control their own sampling settings and thus \"have access to its internal states\" with just a tiny bit of extra programming (the model can write that code for you now lol)\n \nreply",
      "I guess variance is a better word for this. Creativity is a pretty loose term, for example most people will describe R1 as creative in RP/stories for its tendency to derail everything in an unhinged way, but it still lacks variance like every other modern model (kill the reasoning chain and look at logprobs to get what I mean). The bitter lesson is not some threshold and can't be violated, it describes a curve of diminishing returns. As long as you're on the easy part, it's fine.But the bigger problem is that the concepts are expressed before they're decoded into the output distribution. You can steer them to a degree by hacking the autoregressive transport, but if the model itself learned that this concept corresponds to that particular concept, not a set of concepts (and RL tends to do exactly that), fixing it with sampling is usually hard to impossible, you'll just lose accuracy/make it dumber as you basically force out-of-distribution outputs.\n \nreply",
      "How is it not a violation of the bitter lesson?

      "I read through the previous discussions of this, and this article and the previous discussions seem to overlook two things that could have some power to explain the weirdness.First, the development of the process: the system described came into effect in 1268, because previous systems had failed to satisfy fears of factionalism.  IA bit earlier in 1229, a simple, one-round electoral council of 40 had stalemated, so lots were drawn, leading to a feud between the Dandolo family and the winner, Giacomo Tiepolo.  Giacomo's son Lorenzo Tiepolo was the first elected under the 1268 system, which Nicolao Michele seems to have devised.  Not mentioned in the article or discussions is the rule that the men selected were 30 years or older. [0]  The violent factionalism and feuding preceding the new system, however, seems to indicate that oligarchs were fiercely competitive.  The aristocrats were always going to choose some one aristocrat from their own ranks, but they were strongly divided against each other as well.  I'm not sure there would be a solid faction of fifty or so to monopolize the process, especially given the random selections.Secondly, those random selections by lottery, combined with the opening of the article (\"an official went to pray in St. Mark\u2019s Basilica, grabbed the first boy he could find in the piazza\") points to another participant in this process, God.  While today we tend to think of election protocols in terms of human actors, sortition can imply belief in divine providence taking a hand.  The nomination and approval of candidates (election) at least nominally uses human estimation of merit as its input, while sortition gives divine knowledge of merit a role.  The intertwined repetition of the two may have been thought to negotiate a best possible outcome from each set of inputs; in practice, against the backdrop of feuding and factionalism, it likely also made the ultimate 41 electors unpredictable and thus less prone to bribery or prior arrangements.[0] https://origin-rh.web.fordham.edu/halsall/source/dogesvenice...\n \nreply",

      "There is Wirth's 4 page guide, How to use the Oberon Systemhttps://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/ProjectOberon/UsingOberon.p...Also The Oberon Pi Quick Reference and System User Guide at this project page.\n \nreply",
      "If this interests you, I highly recommend Luca Boasso\u2019s oberonc project for the JVM[1].1. https://github.com/lboasso/oberonc\n \nreply",
      "Author of oberonc here, thanks for trying it out :)\n \nreply",
      "Really cool to see Oberon / Modula retro-tech stuff on the front page.Whats somewhat interesting is how structurally similar Oberon is to Go. One could say Go is Oberon dragged halfway towards C/Unix conventions (curly braces) with Go channels slapped on.Rob Pike was aware of Wirth's work, as his ACME editor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)  ) took inspiration from it.So either way, if there was inspiration for Go form Oberon or if there was not [a case of convergent evolution I guess in that case], it shows the strength of Wirth's thought.\n \nreply",
      "I would say Go is C dragged halfway towards Oberon. It's essentially the core group that created and used C admitting Wirth's work was better.\n \nreply",
      "They were already inspired by it for how ACME works, and one of the creators, is a former ETHZ student, with a PhD in Oberon research.\n \nreply",
      "No, it's not. Oberon is just a generic half-assed language that is completely impractical in the real world.It's just that Oberon is so generic that it looks literally like anything (e.g. pre-1.5 Java).Go has several significant differences that made it far more useful:1. Multiple return values for error handling. Its Oberon equivalent is bupkis. If you look at their examples, they just YOLO and print errors onto the console.2. Multiple _returns_. The latest Oberon edition does not support early return from functions.3. Structural polymorphism (objects automatically implement conforming interfaces).4. Generics, and initially generic maps and slices.5. Small neat language features like using the last component of the package path to refer to names.\n \nreply",
      "Not liking Oberon is fine, but calling it a \"generic half-assed language\" is at best grossly ignorant of the effort that went into the design. Wirth had a very clear philosophy for his language, that he followed relentlessly. If you don't like that philosophy, you won't like Oberon, but there's nothing half-assed about it.With respect some of your points, the lack of support for early returns is one of those philosophical decisions, as is many of the other \"missing\" features.Many of them were implemented in various versions by students of Wirth. Polymorphism for Oberon was the subject of at two projects at EHTZ in the 90's, including an at the time fairly novel approaches for a runtime extensible vtable approach to polymorphism.As for your #5, to me that's one of the most horific warts I can think of in the languages that use it, but again a question of philosophy, and certainly one aspect of Go I detest.But to go back to Oberon, as a language user, I find Oberon too austere, but as an implementer, the design is beautiful in its simplicitly and how clean it is, and I wish more language implementers paid attention to Wirths work as a starting point, and paid attention to his systematic approach to language design - even if I'd prefer a result that isn't as minimalist.\n \nreply"
