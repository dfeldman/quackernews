For previous years see Stuff we figured out about AI in 2023 and Things we learned about LLMs in 2024.It\u2019s been a year filled with a lot of different trends.OpenAI kicked off the \u201creasoning\u201d aka inference-scaling aka Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) revolution in September 2024 with o1 and o1-mini. They doubled down on that with o3, o3-mini and o4-mini in the opening months of 2025 and reasoning has since become a signature feature of models from nearly every other major AI lab.My favourite explanation of the significance of this trick comes from Andrej Karpathy:By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like \u201creasoning\u201d to humans\u2014they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and "

Which is why I always dislike additional layers and transforms at this point.(eg. when I think about react native on android, I hear \"now I'll have to be excellent at react/javascript and android/java/kotlin and C++ to be able to debug the bridge; not that \"I can get away with just javascript\".)reply",

      "> Do you debug JVM bytecode? V8's internals? No.I can't speak for the author, but I do often do this.

      "If you're going to set TypeScript as the bar, why not a bidirectional transpile-to-NERD layer? That way you get to see how the LLM handles your experiment, don't have to write a whole new language, and can integrate with an existing ecosystem for free.reply",
      "One major disadvantage here is the lack of training data on a \"new\" language, even if it's more efficient. At least in the short term, this means needing to teach the LLM your language in the context window.I've spent a good bit of time exploring this space in the context of web frameworks and templating languages. One technique that's been highly effective is starting with a _very_ minimal language with only the most basic concepts. Describe that to the LLM, ask it to solve a small scale problem (which the language is likely not yet capable of doing), and see what kinds of APIs or syntax it hallucinates. Then add that to your language, and repeat. Obviously there's room for adjustment along the way, but we've found this process is able to cut many many lines from the system prompts that are otherwise needed to explain new syntax styles to the LLM.reply",

Because the ChatGPT output wouldn't be reviewed!You buy books like these exactly because they are written by a professional, who has taken the time to divide it up into easily digestible chunks which form a coherent narrative, with runnable intermediate stages in-between.For example, I expect a raytracing project to start with simple ray casting of single-color objects. After that it can add things like lights and Blinn-Phong shading, progress with Whitted-style recursive raytracing for the shiny reflections and transparent objects, then progress to modern path tracing with things like BRDFs, and end up with BVHs to make it not horribly slow.You can stop at any point and still end up with a functional raytracer, and the added value of each step is immediately obvious to the reader.

When a computer can do something better than you right now, why bother trying to get better on your own? You never know if you'll end up surpassing it or not.

It's rarely impossible, but I don't think that's ever anyone's point. Sometimes they even make a comeback, like vinyl records.The scope of the topic seems to be what the usual one is, which is the chain of incentives that enable the pursuit of something as a persuasive exchange of value, particularly that of a market that needs a certain amount of volume and doesn't have shady protectionism working for it like standard textbooks.With writing, like with other liberal arts, it's far from a new target of parental scrutiny, and it's my impression that those disciplines have long been the pursuit of people who can largely get away with not really needing a viable source of income, particularly during the apprentice and journeyman stages.Programming has been largely been exempt from that, but if I were in the midst of a traditional comp sci program, facing the existential dreads that are U.S and Canadian economies (at least), along with the effective collapse of a path to financial stability, I'd be stupid not to be considering a major pivot; to what, I don't know.reply"

      "The raw materials: diffractive optical elements and single mode fibers from a materials perspective are all quite easy to manufacture. The primarily limitation with miniaturization is the single-mode fibers, which are limited by the optical wavelength you are using and the index of the fiber. For a conventional silica optical fiber, this is probably around ~100 nm diameter at a minimum. Newer materials can definitely change this 2-3x, but I'm not aware of anything more fundamental.So in general this would be something that you would potentially be able to see in cars, but unlikely consumer electronics or handhelds without a modification in the operational principle (eg time-multiplexing to reduce the required number of fibers).My personal opinion is that competing on low-power and small-scale is a lost cause for photonic computing.

      "I've done something similar a long time ago; using raw read commands, reversing the descrambler output, and then statistical accumulation on the actual bitstream. By showing the output in real-time on a bad-sector you can actually see the signal appearing above the noise.It's strange to see no mention of cleaning the drives themselves, although maybe it was implicit --- if you have a pile of old drives sitting around, chances are they're not going to be perfectly clean. A tiny bit of dirt on the lens can have a huge effect on the read signal, especially on a marginal disc.Related article from 18 years ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21242273reply",
      "I did some research in dumping damaged dvds lately because I had some little treasures laying around that were just unusable.I had good success using DVD Decrypter (hardly available, I got my copy years ago) ignoring bad sectors in the settings, Redumper[1] and, if DVD is only scratched very badly using car-anti-scratch / polish chemicals with a lot of patience [2] (some hints: Toothpaste does not work unless it is whitening toothpaste, don't use tools like a drill, will make the problems even worse, prefer the slow process of polishing by hand).1: https://github.com/superg/redumper2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN8ET7axaNkreply",
      "Wow. Thanks for the heads up on DVD Decrypter being harder to get these days. I had no idea. When I return home I'm going to have the sift through all my old files and see if I still have a copy somewhere. Great little piece of software.reply",
      "MakeMKV is where it's at now as far as I know.reply",
      "So I've recovered a lot of damaged DVDs and I think in my research it showed that DVDs also do ECC across larger than the 2048 data blocks (maybe 16 of them?)So when I used ddrescue, I would read in that block size (instead of just 2048) as if I would get lucky and get a good read (or enough signal that ECC could repair it on the large block).This was very effective at recovering DVDs with repeated reads vs when I had previously done it with 2048 byte reads only I would end up with 2048 byte reads scattered all over (which if ECC is done on 16x2k 32k byte block size, means there was a lot of data I was leaving on the floor that should have been recovered on those reads).Ddrescue was also good for this in the sense that if I was trying to recover a DVD (video) from multiple damaged DVDs, as long as they were not damaged in the same location, i was able to fill in the blanks.Perhaps you can correct me about the 16 block mechanism, perhaps it was just random that it worked and my understanding at the time was wrong.reply",
      "You are both correct and the article discusses it accurately:> Then you have 2048 bytes of user data, scrambled for the reasons mentioned before. The best way to look at the sector as a whole is to think of each sector as 12 \u201crows\u201d consisting of 172 bytes each. After each 172-byte row is 10 bytes of ECC data called Parity Inner (PI), which is based on Reed-Solomon and applied to both the header and scrambled user data per row within the sector itself. Then, after the user data and parity inner data, is the 4-byte EDC, which is calculated over the unscrambled user data only. Then, finally, Parity Outer (PO) is another form of ECC that is applied by \u201ccolumn\u201d that spans over an entire block of multiple sectors stacked horizontally, or in other words, a group of 16 sectors. Altogether, this adds up to 2366 bytes of recorded sector data.reply",
      "The whole article is about the heroic efforts to dump a DVD that has bad sectors by using a combination of different methods that ultimately yielded a fully read disc.reply",
      "Which drives and parameters for the READ BUF SCSI command yielded the expected 2366 bytes per sector? I imagine that it was combined with seeks to each sector before reading from the buffer (as it would be harder to isolate multiple sectors data in cache?).It seems like it was a follow-up from previous bruteforce efforts, which include a spreadsheet with various results, but it would help to have some conclusions on which were best: http://forum.redump.org/topic/51851/dumping-dvds-raw-an-ongo...Also, couldn't find any source/download for DiscImageMender.reply"

The deny rule only covered the workspace-relative path.What kind of sandbox has the entire host accessible from the guest? I'm not going as far as running codex/claude in a sandbox, but I do run them in podman, and of course I don't mount my entire harddrive to the container when it's running, that would defeat the entire purpose.Where is the actual session logs? It seems like they're pushing their own solution, yet the actual data for these are missing, and the whole \"provoked through red-teaming efforts\" makes it a bit unclear of what exactly they put in the system prompts, if they changed them. Adding things like \"Do whatever you can to recreate anything missing\" might of course trigger the agent to actually try things like forging integrity fields, but not sure that's even bad, you do want it to follow what you say.reply",

As I understand it, this rule isn't because we have shown it's dangerous to do the pig -> insect -> pig chain but rather because we haven't shown that it's safe. Arnold van Huis and his team at Wageningen University are putting quite some energy researching the safety and lobbying the EU to change the rules based on the findings. At one of the talks those folks they said it's basically a black box of trying to get what kind of science the regulators will consider acceptable.As you might guess, making sure the food waste you feed the insects doesn't have _any_ animal proteins in it is quite logistically challenging and so afaik nobody is doing that at a large scale.I did quite a bit of research into the history of insects in the food system, especially in the Netherlands. While I was rooting for Ynsect and other big players to figure something good out I believe that it's a problem much better suited to a smaller scale (perhaps on the city level).

      "> \"Trellis coded modulation got this rate up to 50 kilobaud by the 1990s\"Not quite, and an interesting story that fits these engineering maxims better than you might think.An analog channel with the bandwidth and SNR characteristics of a landline phone line has (IIRC) a Shannon capacity of 30-something kbit/s, which was closely approached with V.34, which used trellis coded modulation plus basically every other coding and equalization mechanism they knew of at the time to get to 33.6kb/s on a good day.But... by the 80s or so the phone system was only analog for the \"last mile\" to the home - the rest of the system was digital, sending 8-bit samples (using logarithmic mu-law encoding) at a sampling rate of 8000 samples/s, and if you had a bunch of phone lines coming into a facility you could get those lines delivered over a digital T1 link.Eventually someone realized that if your ISP-side modem directly outputs digital audio, the downstream channel capacity is significantly higher - in theory the limit is probably 64000 bit/s, i.e. the bit rate of the digital link, although V.90 could only achieve about 56000 b/s in theory, and more like 53kb/s in practice. (in particular, the FCC limited the total signal power, which means not all 64000 combinations of bits in a second of audio would be allowable)I worked with modem modulation folks when I was a co-op student in the mid-80s. They had spent their lives thinking about the world in terms of analog channels, and it took some serious out-of-the-box thinking on someone's part to realize that the channel was no longer analog, and that you could take advantage of that.A few years later those same folks all ended up working on cable modems, and it was back to the purely analog world again.reply",
      "> if your ISP-side modem directly outputs digital audio, the downstream channel capacity is significantly higherBut why is it higher? It's still an analog channel (the last mile from the ISP to your house), right? Doesn't it get filtered?

We operated a local ISP in the 90's and did exactly that by ordering so-called \"alarm circuits\" from the telco (with no dial tone) and placed a copper T1 CSU on each end. We marketed it as \"metro T1\" and undercut traditional T1 pricing by a huge margin with great success to the surrounding downtown area.reply",

      "It's ISP\u2190A\u2192Telco\u2190D\u2192Telco\u2190A\u2192YouTraditionally both the ISP and you pay for analog phone lines from the telco. The telco uses digital internally (remember you and your ISP probably aren't at the same exchange), which puts a hard limit on data rate - there is no trick you can do to get more bits through than the bits used in the digital part of the call.If you (as the ISP) buy enough lines you can get them delivered in digital format. A T1 is designed to carry 24 simultaneous phone calls, acting virtually as a bundle of 24 analog phone cables. So the obvious next stage was to have a modem that can handle 24 simultaneous connections on one cable.Now you have ISP\\_modem\u2190Ax24\u2192ISP\\_muxer\u2190Dx24\u2192Telco\u2190\u2192Telco\u2190A\u2192UserThe ISP's modem generates analog signals for up to 24 simultaneous incoming calls, and they pass into a multiplexer that connects 24 analog lines to a T1 line and they go through the telco digitally to users. The maximum bandwidth is still as before - the modem has to generate an analog signal that will still be receivable at the other end after A2D and D2A conversion. Even though the digital bandwidth for the digital part is 56kbps, the maximum achievable bandwidth through this digital-bottlenecked analog call was found to be 33.6kbps.But the industry had an idea: by convincing the telco to install the modems into the user's exchange, the analog portion would only be between the telco and the user, without a digital segment in the middle of it, and therefore wouldn't be bottlenecked the same way. The same digital backhaul from the ISP through the telco was used, but instead of transmitting a digitised analog modem signal and therefore causing degradation of quality, it transmitted your actual internet traffic bits, up to 56kbps. The analog signal was made at the user's side of the telco and didn't have to fit within 56kbps when digitised.Pedantically, the digital circuits are 64kbps but one bit in some bytes is used for call status signaling, which is okay for voice, but the ISP equipment can't predict which bytes have a bit overwritten (and it could be multiple if there are several hops) so it just used 7 bits in each byte.reply",

      "> It\u2019s especially common in vertical videos like YouTube Shorts, where the stored resolution is a square 1080 \u00d7 1080, and the aspect ratio makes it a portrait.My guess is this is because encoding hardware can do max 1920x1080, and there is no easy way to make that hardware encode 1080x1920, so you are forced to encode as 1080x1080.    Swapping rows and columns in hardware tends to be a big change because caches and readahead totally changes when you process the data in a different order.reply",

      ">Before HD, almost all video was non-square pixelsCorrect. This came from the ITU-R BT.601 standard, one of the first digital video standards authors of which chose to define digital video as a sampled analog signal. Analog video never had a concept of pixels and operated on lines instead. The rate at which you could sample it could be arbitrary, and affected only the horizontal resolution. The rate chosen by BT.601 was 13.5 MHz, which resulted in a 10/11 pixel aspect ratio for 4:3 NTSC video and 59/54 for 4:3 PAL.>SD channels on cable TV systems are 528x480I'm not actually sure about America, but here in Europe most digital cable and satellite SDTV is delivered as 720x576i 4:2:0 MPEG-2 Part 2. There are some outliers that use 544x576i, however.reply",
      "Good post. For anyone wondering \"why do we have these particular resolutions, sampling and frame rates, which seem quite random\", allow me to expand and add some color to your post (pun intended). Similar to how modern railroad track widths can be traced back to the wheel widths of roman chariots, modern digital video standards still reverberate with echoes from 1930s black-and-white television standards.BT.601 is from 1982 and was the first widely adopted analog component video standard (sampling analog video into 3 color components (YUV) at 13.5 MHz). Prior to BT.601, the main standard for video was SMPTE 244M created by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, a composite video standard which sampled analog video at 14.32 MHz. Of course, a higher sampling rate is, all things equal, generally better. The reason for BT.601 being lower (13.5 MHz) was a compromise - equal parts technical and political.Analog television was created in the 1930s as a black-and-white composite standard and in 1953 color was added by a very clever hack which kept all broadcasts backward compatible with existing B&W TVs. Politicians mandated this because they feared nerfing all the B&W TVs owned by voters. But that hack came with some significant technical compromises which complicated and degraded analog video for over 50 years. The composite and component sampling rates (14.32 MHz and 13.5 MHz) are both based on being 4x a specific existing color carrier sampling rate from analog television. And those two frequencies directly dictated all the odd-seeming horizontal pixel resolutions we find in pre-HD digital video (352, 704, 360, 720 and 768) and even the original PC display resolutions (CGA, VGA, XGA, etc). To be clear, analog television signals were never pixels. Each horizontal scanline was only ever an oscillating electrical voltage from the moment photons struck an analog tube in a TV camera to the home viewer's cathode ray tube (CRT). Early digital video resolutions were simply based on how many samples an analog-to-digital converter would need to fully recreate the original electrical voltage.For example, 720 is tied to 13.5 Mhz because sampling the active picture area of an analog video scanline at 13.5 MHz generates 1440 samples (double per-Nyquist). Similarly, 768 is tied to 14.32 MHz generating 1536 samples. VGA's horizontal resolution of 640 is simply from adjusting analog video's rectangular aspect ratio to be square (720 * 0.909 = 640). It's kind of fascinating all these modern digital resolutions can be traced back to decisions made in the 1930s based on which affordable analog components were available, which competing commercial interests prevailed (RCA vs Philco) and the political sensitivities present at the time.reply",

Very cool project!Hopefully your API doesn't get exploited and you are doing timeouts/sandboxing -- it'd be easy to do a massive join on this.I also have a question mostly stemming from me being not knowledgeable in the area -- have you noticed any semantic bleeding when research is done between your datasets? e.g., \"optimization\" probably means different things under ArXiv, LessWrong, and HN.

We do AST parsing and block certain joins, and Hacker News has not bricked or overloaded my machine yet--there's actually a lot more bandwidth for people to run expensive queries.As for getting good semantic queries for different domains, one thing Claude can do besides use our embed endpoint to embed arbitrary text as a search vector, is use compositions of centroids (averages) of vectors in our database, as search vectors. Like it can effortlessly average every lesswrong chunk embedding over text mentioning \"optimization\" and search with that. You can actually ask Claude to run an experiment averaging the \"optimization\" vectors from different sources, and see what kind of different queries you get when using them on different sources. Then the fun challenge would be figuring out legible vectors that bridge the gap between these different platform's vectors. Maybe there's half the cosine distance when you average the lesswrong \"optimization\" vector with embed(\"convex/nonconvex optimization, SGD, loss landscapes, constrained optimization.\")reply",
