      "Neat! It's rare to see that a service you use actually does something that benefits the user rather that itself. An unexpected, but a really pleasant surprise.I wish this extension would integrate better with the browser by automatically understanding the context. That is, if I'm in a \"regular\" mode it'll use my session, but if I'm in a \"private browsing\" mode (`browser.extension.inIncognitoContext`) it'll use Privacy Pass to authenticate me, without me having to explicitly do anything about it.(I don't use Orion, as there's no GNU/Linux version.)\n \nreply",
      "> It's rare to see that a service you use actually does something that benefits the user rather that itselfThe reason it's become so rare is most companies in this space (heck tons of tech companies period) have used a business model of offering a thing to one group of users and then turning around and selling the results of that thing to another group of users, where the latter group is the one actually driving your revenue. This by default almost assumes a hostility towards the former group because their interests will of course be at odds with the interests of the latter group.What's refreshing about Kagi and other new tech companies is they have dumped this model in favor of having just one group that they serve and drive revenue from (ie. the 'old' model).\n \nreply",
      "The other part to this is that the internet accelerates network-effects, which you can further supercharge by making your product as cheap as possible or free to the former group in your example.It\u2019s hard to make money by charging a lot to a small group of people since now you\u2019re dealing with anti-network effects. Doubling the price of a product will likely more than halve your user base.\n \nreply",
      "This is one of the best explanations I've seen for this phenomenon.If you try to build a network of paid users, you lose because you'll be run over by 'free' competitors monetizing indirectly.\n \nreply",
      "Playing devil's advocate...Yeah, the ad supported model has its problems, but it also makes the internet way more accessible. If we think about it, companies and people with more money are basically subsidizing these services for everyone else. They're the ones seeing the ads that keeps the lights on for users who can't afford to pay.If everything was subscription only, a ton of people like students, low income families, people in developing countries would be shut out. \"Free\" services, even with their flaws, create a kind of digital subsidy. It's not perfect, but it means way more people can use these tools.\n \nreply",
      "Playing the... angel's advocate...There's no reason why a subscription model could not also be used to subsidize people who can not pay, other than that companies are structured to extract as much as possible (by law, if they are public).There are good network effect arguments about why this strategy can be effective, not simply 'altruistic.'Ads simply make the extraction happen across the board, except that the ad model somewhat privileges technical users who know how to circumvent ads.\n \nreply",
      "What's the mechanism by which a private company does e.g. income verification to figure out who gets subsidy or not?Or would the idea be to only subsidize students and not poor adults?It would be one thing if we had like a national \"verify I'm on SNAP or equivalent API\"\n \nreply",

If we think about it, companies and people with more money are basically subsidizing these services for everyone else. They're the ones seeing the ads that keeps the lights on for users who can't afford to pay.The problem (other than the obvious privacy and noise issues) is that it's not a neutral subsidy. It introduces a lot of biases.Since advertisers are subsidizing the platform, they tilt the content toward things they want and away from messages they don't. Messages that criticize advertisers products (which include things like governments and political ideologies since they are advertisers) are de-emphasized and marginalized.Since impressions / clicks / eyeballs are the goal, an inherent bias is introduced toward emotionally triggering and/or addictive or hypnotic content. The reason social media for example is so divisive and negative is that this keeps people engaged by triggering simple powerful emotions.\n \nreply",

At the same time, we are announcing the immediate availability of Kagi\u2019s Tor onion service.In general terms, Privacy Pass allows \u201cClients\u201d (generally users) to authenticate to \u201cServers\u201d (like Kagi) in such a way that while the Server can verify that the connecting Client has the right to access its services, it cannot determine which of its rightful Clients is actually connecting. This is particularly useful in the context of a privacy-respecting paid search engine, where the Server wants to ensure that the Client can access the services, and the Client seeks strong guarantees that, for example, the searches are not associated with them.As a privacy-respecting search engine, Kagi\u2019s business model is such that we have no incent"

He requested Debian stop shipping it (or update it?

      "Comments in case the demo developer sees this:* The swiping in the demo was a rough for me, on a laptop with Firefox.  One of the tricks was to be sure to release the mouse button before the cursor hits the edge of white rectangle fake screen.  Swiping off the edge without a button-up event doesn't seem to be handled.* At the end of a swipe that registers, after you mouse-up, there's a noticeable lag of sometimes up to approx. one second, during which the card is frozen in place, before it finishes sliding off.* The rotation effect on the card as it's being swiped wasn't intuitive, IMHO.  It doesn't follow the vertical movement in the swipe, and there's no obvious physical metaphor for why it's doing that.  Perhaps especially with the other roughness going on, the rotation confuses things a little bit more; but maybe, if the other behavior was perfect, the rotation would be fine.\n \nreply",

      "As an academic researcher, it's most frustrating in that it feels like IRB scrutiny doesn't seem to align with risk.I do accounting research. My human-subjects research involves surveying practitioners about their jobs, interviewing them about their experiences, and conducting very simple experiments online that ask them to make decisions. There is virtually 0 real risk to any participants of my studies. IRB does always give my studies \"exempt\" status, but it still has to be reviewed. And they will pester me about different things like where will store our data (Onedrive is fine, but dropbox is not for some reason). This process will typically take a couple weeks of back and forth.Yet I have a friend who participated in a Kinesiology dissertation study where they were asked to do extremely strenuous physical activity. He fainted(!) at one point from the activity. And it seemed to them that there were relatively few safeguards from that happening.

      "The SQL with pipe syntax is also been implemented at Databricks since Jan 30, 2025:\nhttps://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-s...Still, the best is yet to come. Previously, SQL extensions were a pain. There was no good place, and table-value functions were a mess.Now, it would be possible to have higher-order functions such as enrichment, predictions, grouping or other data contracts. Example:  FROM orders\n  |> WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'\n  |> AGGREGATE SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent GROUP BY customer_id\n  |> WHERE total_spent > 1000\n  |> INNER JOIN customers USING(customer_id)\n  |> CALL ENRICH.APOLLO(EMAIL > customers.email)\n  |> AGGREGATE COUNT(*) high_value_customer GROUP BY company.country\n\nThis may be called one SQL to determine distinct e-mail domains, then prepare an enriching dataset and later execute the final SQL with JOIN.Iterative SQL with pipes may also work better with GenAI.\n \nreply",

      "If only it worked on Databricks serverless SQL warehouses...\n \nreply",
      "I like it, but I'm not sure it's worth the trouble of further expanding an ever-ballooning extended family of SQL syntaxes.Of course, SQL has numerous issues, both in an absolute sense and relative to what we've come to expect. And the obvious course of action in each individual case is to add syntax to support the missing feature.But as you keep adding syntax, SQL gets more and more complex, both in the individual variants and due to the complexities of multiple variants with different syntax support at different times.A transpiling approach makes more sense to me. I'd like the sql implementors to focus on source maps and other things to better support plugging in external, alternate syntaxes (is a standardized mechanism too much to ask for?).Then individual projects/people/efforts can choose the SQL syntax variant that works for them, and it can be one that evolves separate from the host db.\n \nreply",
      "Plain transpiling won\u2019t work because when you write a SQL query, you have to know what engine is running it because they all do worse at some things than others.For example, the same result could be fetched using a correlated subquery, a common table expression, a temporary table, a view or very hackily using aggregation and it would depend on whether you were using SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL, or SQLite because they don\u2019t do it all fast. \u2026and you need to know the version.This might be able to be solved if the language was a brand new higher level one though and the compiler knew the intricacies of each engines.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, any such transpiler would certainly need to be engine aware (for multiple reasons). Right off the bat, the output needs to be in a syntax the engine accepts, and there are all kinds of differences from engine to engine, version to version.And, as you say, if the language contains higher-level abstractions, it might need to work quite differently depending on the target engine.My thought is to avoid those higher-level abstractions as much as possible and just expose the capabilities of the engine as directly as possible, albeit with a different syntax. In my experience, developers who are willing and able to write SQL are fine with targeting a specific engine and optimizing to that. (Those that aren't get someone else to do it, or live with he sad consequences of dealing with an ORM.)To summarize:Normal Approach: you pick an engine, and get the syntax that comes with it. You need to know what the engine does well and doesn't do well. You write SQL accordingly, using the syntax the engine accepts.Transpiler Approach: you pick an engine, and independently choose a syntax. You still need to know what the engine does well and doesn't do well. You still write SQL accordingly, but using the syntax of the language you chose.\n \nreply",
      "I don\u2019t know if the transpiler approach really helps when you still have to be aware of the underlying database engine. I\u2019m fine with choosing something like PostgreSQL and writing code optimized for its specific SQL dialect.But I\u2019m not sure I want to deal with a transpiler that still suffers from a leaky abstraction. It starts to feel a lot like using an ORM. ORMs promise database-agnostic syntax across different engines, but that promise falls apart when you need to optimize a query and suddenly realize you must account for engine-specific features\u2014like PostgreSQL\u2019s BRIN indexes.\n \nreply",
      "To me, abstracting away the engine is not a goal. (Generally, it's pointless -- the various engines work in different ways and offer different features. While there's a bunch of stuff that widely common, that's also the stuff you don't really need to abstract.)The point of transpiling is to allow you to pick a syntax independent of the engine. You still have to pick the engine and will deal with its peculiarities.Today's post is about pipe syntax, which is syntax. Yesterday's was about trailing commas, which is syntax. I think there's an appetite for this.\n \nreply",
