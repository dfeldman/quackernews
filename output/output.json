    "first_paragraph": "RTC products use many building blocks to deliver the full experience, and one of the critical components is audio/video codecs. These codecs help compress the captured audio/video data so it can be sent across the internet efficiently to the recipient, keeping the experience real time. For example, the size of raw audio captured for a typical call is 768 kbps (mono, sampling at 48kHz, bit depth 16), which modern codecs are able to compress down to 25-30 kbps. Often this compression comes at the cost of some quality (loss of information), but good codecs can strike a balance among the trio of quality, bitrate, and complexity by exploiting deep knowledge about the nature of the audio signal as well as by using psychoacoustics."

First, that modern desktop operating systems are anything but. They are bloated, slow, and layered with legacy cruft that still functions only thanks to Moore's Law.  Second, that innovation in desktop operating systems stopped about 15 years ago and the major players are unlikely to heavily invest in them again. And finally, I hope to convince you that we can and should start over from scratch, learning the lessons of the past."
