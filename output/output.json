      "> When BGP traffic is being sent from point A to point B, it can be rerouted through a point C. If you control point C, even for a few hours, you can theoretically collect vast amounts of intelligence that would be very useful for government entities. The CANTV AS8048 being prepended to the AS path 10 times means there the traffic would not prioritize this route through AS8048, perhaps that was the goal?AS prepending is a relatively common method of traffic engineering to reduce traffic from a peer/provider. Looking at CANTV's (AS8048) announcements from outside that period shows they do this a lot.Since this was detected as a BGP route leak, it looks like CANTV (AS8048) propagated routes from Telecom Italia Sparkle (AS6762) to GlobeNet Cabos Sumarinos Columbia (AS52320). This could have simply been a misconfiguration.Nothing nefarious immediately jumps out to me here. I don't see any obvious attempts to hijack routes to Dayco Telecom (AS21980), which was the actual destination. The prepending would have made traffic less likely to transit over CANTV assuming there was any other route available.The prepending done by CANTV does make it slightly easier to hijack traffic destined to it (though not really to Dayco), but that just appears to be something they just normally do.This could be CANTV trying to force some users of GlobeNet to transit over them to Dayco I suppose, but leaving the prepending in would be an odd way of going about it. I suppose if you absolutely knew you were the shortest path length, there's no reason to remove the prepending, but a misconfiguration is usually the cause of these things.reply",

      "That's not what this is about.HTTPS is the name of a protocol, which is mostly used to make the World Wide Web work, but we do lots of other things with it, such as DNS-over-HTTPS aka DoH.However HTTPS is also the name of a type of DNS record, this record contains everything you need to best reach the named HTTPS (protocol) server, and this is the type of record your parent didn't previously know aboutIn the boring case, say, 20 years ago, when you type https://some.name/stuff/hats.html into a web browser your browser goes \"Huh, HTTPS to some.name. OK, I will find out the IPv4 address of some.name, and it makes a DNS query asking A? some.name. The DNS server answers with an IPv4 address, and then as the browser connects securely to that IP address, it asks to talk to some.name, and if the remote host can prove it is some.name, the browser says it wants /stuff/hats.htmlNotice we have to tell the remote server who we hope they are - and it so happens eavesdroppers can listen in on this. This means Bad Guys can see that you wanted to visit some.name. They can't see that you wanted to read the document about hats, but they might be able to guess that from context, and wouldn't you rather they didn't know more than they need to?With the HTTPS record, your web browser asks (over secure DNS if you have it) HTTPS? some.name  and, maybe it gets a positive answer. If it does, the answer tells it not only where to try to connect, but also it can choose to provide instructions for a cover name to always use, and how to encrypt the real name, this is part of Encrypted Client Hello (or ECH)Then the web server tells the server that it wants to talk to the cover name and it provides an encrypted version of some.name. Eavesdroppers can't decrypt that, so if many people share the same endpoints then eavesdropper can't tell which site you were visiting.Now, if the server only contains documents about hats, this doesn't stop the Secret Hat Police from concluding that everybody connecting to that server is a Hat Pervert and needs to go to Hat Jail. But if you're a bulk host then you force such organisations to choose, they can enforce their rules equally for everything (You wanted to read News about Chickens? Too bad, Hat Jail for you) or they can accept that actually they don't know what people are reading (if this seems crazy, keep in mind that's how US Post worked for many years after Comstock failed, if you get a brown paper package posted to you, well, it's your business what is in there, and your state wasn't allowed to insist on ripping open the packaging to see whether it is pornography or communist propaganda)reply",

      "i don't see them mentioning of price and C-rating. Suppose their C-rating is sufficient. Current widely available cheap batteries are almost 300Wh/kg. So, on a 3 kg drone with up to 3 kg payload (say RPG-7 single shaped charge warhead) with say 30 min flight time the new battery will give you 10 min additional flight time. At what price? If the price results in having only one 40 min drone instead of 2 30 min drones, then in the current war, only say 10% drones would need to be with new batteries, while it would be most effective to have the rest with the old batteries as the current war seems to be about horizontal scaling.Overall - their page sounds like a revolution in battery industry as they hit all the points - durability, capacity/weight, fast charging, etc. It is like Musk should just close his GigaFactory.

The only thing I'm particularly suspicious of is that they claim their battery was verified but didn't say by who or provide a whitepaper on it.

If you are allowed to reorient the sofa while moving it, and the sofa doesn't have a minimum height, and the ceiling is arbitrarily high, then the sofa can be arbitrarily large by angling it to an arbitrary degree and then setting it flat for measuring.3. So the in between case is where the ceiling is of some limited height and/or the sofa is of some arbitrary height, and then you have to decide whether the sofa has to be an extrusion of a 2D shape, or if it can be an arbitrary shape, at which point you're maximizing volume rather than area. And for that the obvious lower bound is the 2D maximum shape * the ceiling height. But maybe there's better?reply",

      "In my view, the meta-advice is to understand the goals and constraints of your boss (and their boss), and work towards those goals (while adhering to the constraints).With that perspective, we can derive some rules of thumb:1. Promotions are not a reward for past performance. Instead, they are a bet that you will contribute more towards those goals with a promotion than without one.2. As the OP says, if you are demonstrating performance at your boss's level, that's evidence/proof that a promotion is warranted. Your boss's goals get implemented (by you), freeing them to work on their boss's goals (and maybe get their own promotion).3. The more time you spend with your boss, the better you will understand their goals, and symmetrically, the better they will understand your strengths. That means leaving a job after a year or two is not always optimal. It also means following a good boss to another company is often a good move.4. There will be cases where the goals of your boss (and their boss) diverge from your own goals. They often want to cut costs, but you want a salary increase. There are never easy answers to this dilemma, but seeing their perspective is useful so you can find a win-win scenario. E.g., if you come up with a way to save money in other ways, such as automating an external cost, then your increased salary will be worth it.5. In some cases, of course, there is no way to reconcile your boss's goals with your own. Realizing that is useful so you can find a different company/boss that is more aligned.reply",

They get N years of \"next level\" work out of you while still being able to pay those N years in \"previous level\" salary. Good deal for them.My current company used to work this way, but they moved to a \"needs-based\" promo process. You can be promoted to L5 if your manager can justify the need for an L5.Which ends up making promotions significantly harder to come by. It's near impossible to justify the need for an L5 role when you already have L4s doing the work.

      "Neural networks are effectively gauge invariant, and you have a huge space of valid isomorphisms as far as possible \"valid\" layer orderings go, and if your network is overparameterized, the space of \"good enough\" approximations gets correspondingly larger. The good enough sets are a sort of fuzzy gauge quotient approximating some \"ideal\" function per layer or cluster or block (depending on your optimizer and architecture.)https://arxiv.org/html/2506.13018v2 - Here's an interesting paper that can help inform how you might look at networks, especially in the context of lottery tickets, gauge quotients, permutations, and what gradient descent looks like in practice.Kolmogorov Arnold Networks are better about exposing gauge symmetry and operating in that space, but aren't optimized for the hardware we have - mechinterp and other reasons might inspire new hardware, though. If you know what your layer function should look like, if it were ordered such that it resembled a smooth spline, you could initialize and freeze the weights of that layer, and force the rest of the network to learn within the context of your chosen ordering.The number of \"valid\" configurations for a layer is large, especially if you have more neurons in the layer than you need, and the number of subsequent layer configurations is much larger than you'd think. The lottery ticket hypothesis is just circling that phenomenon without formalizing it - some surprisingly large percentage of possible configurations will approximate the function you want a network to learn. It doesn't necessarily gain you advantages in achieving the last 10% , and there could be counterproductive configurations that collapse before reaching an optimal configuration.There are probably optimizer strategies that can exploit initializations of certain types, for different classes of activation functions, and achieve better performance for architectures - and all of those things are probably open to formalized methods based on existing number theory around gauge invariant systems and gauge quotients, with different layer configurations existing as points in gauge orbits in hyperdimensional spaces.It'd be really cool if you could throw twice as many neurons as you need into a model, randomly initialize a bunch of times until you get a winning ticket, then distill the remainder down to your intended parameter count, and train from there as normal.It's more complex with architectures like transformers, but you're not dealing with a combinatorial explosion with the LTH - more like a little combinatorial flash flood, and if you engineer around it, it can actually be exploited.reply",

But we really need better tooling for auditing (and enforcing tha auditing has happened) to properly solve this.reply",
      "I think the broader point being made here is that the C-style approach is to extract a minimal subset of the dependency and tightly review it and integrate it into your code. The Rust/Python approach is to use cargo/pip and treat the dependency as a black box outside your project.reply",

In essence, you\u2019re signing up to maintain a limited fork & watch for CVEs separately from upstream.So it's ultimately a trade off rather than a strictly superior solution.Also, nothing in Rust prevents you from doing the same thing. In fact, I would argue that Cargo makes this process easier.reply",

      "In security-sensitive code, you take dependencies sparingly, audit them, and lock to the version you audited and then only take updates on a rigid schedule (with time for new audits baked in) or under emergency conditions only.Not all dependencies are created equal. A dependency with millions of users under active development with a corporate sponsor that has a posted policy with an SLA to respond to security issues is an example of a low-risk dependency. Someone's side project with only a few active users and no way to contact the author is an example of a high-risk dependency. A dependency that forces you to take lots of indirect dependencies would be a high-risk dependency.Here's an example dependency policy for something security critical: https://github.com/tock/tock/blob/master/doc/ExternalDepende...Practically, unless you code is super super security sensitive (something like a root of trust), you won't be able to review everything. You end up going for \"good\" dependencies that are lower risk. You throw automated fuzzing and linting tools, and these days ask AI to audit it as well.You always have to ask: what are the odds I do something dumb and introduce a security bug vs what are the odds I pull a dependency with a security bug.

Those kinds of watches feel like they are designed for athletes who want to leave their phone at home. I'm not that guy. My phone comes with me everywhere, so why would I want phone-light on my wrist when my phone in my pocket can do it better?Pebble also gets battery life.

      "I'm a runner, so obviously biased, but I implore everyone (to the point of annoyance) to check out some of the cheaper Garmin smart watches. They use MIP displays so the battery life runs about 2 weeks, you get phone notifications, the ability to find your phone, sleep scoring, step counting, heart rate monitoring. Then there's the obvious GPS run recording which you don't have to use. There's more stuff as well but I don't really use that like NFC card payments, music controls, but overall it hits a nice balance of features versus battery life.For the sake of fair comparison, my wife had an Apple watch, which looked better and had way more features, but the 1 day battery life became such a frustration it sat in a dresser drawer. My last Garmin lasted 5 years with daily use and sports, and only died because I took it into the sea on vacation after the waterproof seal failed on the screen. I replaced it the day I got back with the successor model and couldn't be happier.I'm not shilling for Garmin (or at least not being paid to), I love the Pebbles and I'm very much looking forward to the launch as I want a more fashionable smartwatch.

I don't need my watch, but I do need my phone, so I charge the phone, and forget that my watch exists for a few months at a time. I think the biggest hurdle for me and watches is daily charging.
