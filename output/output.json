      "The most important question for every cross platform framework is what happens to the UI?Adobe products (both the Creative Suite, and their Flex Builder environment for Flash app) had their own design system that felt foreign on every platform it shipped on.  If you wanted something that felt native, you had to reimplement e.g. Apple Aqua in Flash yourself.Flutter goes out of its way to do that work for you, aiming for a \"Cupertino\" theme that looks-and-feels pixel-perfect on iOS.React Native tries to delegate to platform primitives for complex widgets, so scroll views still feel like Apple's when on Apple's platform.Just about every top-level comment here is talking about that in one way or another; yet the blog post doesn't mention it at all.It's possible that Apple/Swift's mindshare among developers will lead to a significant number of apps shipping the Swift version for Android even if it means using Apple's UI, simply because they can't be bothered to make something bespoke for Android.  Then again, Apple takes so much pride in its design language that it might not be willing to implement anything that feels good on a platform they don't own.  If they were to ship an API-compatible widget toolkit, it might e.g. use intentionally bad spring physics to remind you you aren't on an iPhone.I wonder how big the community part of this is.  Is this an open source project of non-Apple people who are trying to break Apple's platform out of its walled garden?  Is a lot of it funded by Apple?  Ultimately, that's going to shape a lot of how this plays out.reply",
      "> The most important question for every cross platform framework is what happens to the UI?I kindly disagree. The first feature I want from a cross-platform framework is that it lets me write a native UI. That's why I like KMP: I can just share a framework with an iOS app built with SwiftUI.Sharing business logic makes a lot of sense in a ton of cases and has been done forever (C/C++/Rust/Go libraries, etc). Sharing UI in complex apps, in my experience, always ends up being a \"write once - debug everywhere\" nightmare.What KMP (and I'm hoping Swift for Android) bring is the possibility to share a Kotlin (respectively Swift) library instead of sharing code with C/C++/Rust/Go. So that an Android/iOS team can keep using Android/Swift without having to introduce a third language for sharing logic.reply",
      "> Sharing UI in complex apps, in my experience, always ends up being a \"write once - debug everywhere\" nightmareAmen!reply",
      "Having worked a long time with client teams as a lead - this is always the biggest pain in the ass.At one of my last phase startups I started shifting all our business logic stuff into our graphql server and treated it like it was part of the client teams.  (we had ios/android/web as independent full apps with a very small team of devs).Business logic is the real killer.  Have one person suck it up and do it in typescript (sorry y'all) on the GQL/apollo server and all the clients can ingest it easy.Send down viewmodels to the clients not data models.  etc etc.This helped DRAMATICALLY with complexity in the clients.reply",
      "So your takeaway is that business logic should be done on the server. Hasn't it always been like this?reply",
      "Has been the true core vision of the web if not mobile. If I remember correctly, that is how the original Basecamp was implemented, or Craigslist (still is?)... or this very websitereply",

So that an Android/iOS team can keep using Android/Swift without having to introduce a third language for sharing logic.\n\nhave gone down this route before, and tbh the biggest issue is dev ux (ios devs cant debug easily, model mismatches vs kotlin e.g kotlin exceptions cant be caught from swift) and in the end even kotlin multi platform isn't the same as kotlin for android, so in a sense you are still introducing a 3rd language after a fashion...if you can fix the dev issues and have a dedicated team behind the shared logic it could work out, but still then again if you also have a website your re-implementing that logic on the front-end twice...reply",
      "It's worth noting that this doesn't add any expectations for how your UI is built. The example shown in the screenshot continues to use Jetpack Compose (Android's native UI) with Kotlin invoking Swift business logic. You can also use other UI frameworks on Android, of course, including some that are written in Swift.One nice thing about this implementation is that it shares many of the same characteristics as Swift on other platforms: unlike some common alternatives, it's not garbage collected but uses reference counting; it uses the same underlying libraries, concurrency primitives and memory model.Excited to see how folk use it... it's technology that will hopefully springboard some other interesting innovations.[Disclosure: I work on developer tools and frameworks at Apple.]reply",
      "How does transpiration work without GC?  I would think all the Kotlin equivalents would be GC heap allocated objects.reply",

Inheriting code and not knowing what to do with it and trying to forensically triangulate what is going on and learning to read code in the process: this was the best way to learn.  The argument that vibe coding is something like that is maybe one of the more hopeful arguments i've heard about it.reply",

Let me just take a look at that CD.I like the idea of shifting the discussion from \"how it is done\" to \"what are we doing\".Therefore, the point here is that we should do things the CD can't.In that sense, the package thingy is better than LLMs. It gives you a directory that you can explore and the choice of not wasting time doing things that are already on the CD.But then, you can say that directory is very large today. So large, we might need an index. And LLMs are just that. But if they're that, then there's some value in finding novel ways to glue things together.And round and round we go.reply"

I'm hoping the window heat pumps that just run off mains will be available to more markets soon, I could buy one of those for every room in my house for less than the install on a single mini split.Where it did make sense was when I was getting solar.

I end up paying more in utilities because electricity is very expensive and heat pumps aren\u2019t nearly as good at heating in the winters as old fashioned gas furnaces when it comes to the cost.I made the massive investment because I could and I eventually want my house to run completely on rooftop solar as a way to reduce my carbon footprint.

Up to 80 percent of the transistors on a modern chip must remain \u201cdark\u201d at any given moment to keep the chip from sizzling. We are building supercomputers on a sliver of silicon but only using a fraction of their potential.

State Supreme Court dismantled it.reply",
      "I had a good impression of \"Montessori\" from hearing that Larry/Sergey/Bezos went to one. When I put my kid in it at 3 years old, he hated it. As I looked into it more, it seems to me that it is actually very rigid, with kids being able to play with just a small set of toys that don't really exercise their creativity, and with little opportunity for group play. We switched him to a Reggio Emilia school where the kids are constantly doing group projects and art and he enjoys it a lot more. I recommend parents observe what's actually happening in classrooms and think about what's best for their kid in the early years instead of assuming \"Montessori\" is the best path.reply",

The attitude of the teachers and the other students was fantastic, and it really helped propel me forward in life, gave me a ton of lessons that I don't think most people were able to take from their own public high schools.In both cases, my parents (Mom especially) were so incredibly stubborn about finding the best school for their kids. We literally moved the whole family to the town that had the best public school where my parents could afford a single family home.

      "Lean was a gamechanger for me as someone who has a \"hobby\" level interest in abstract mathematics. I don't have the formal education that would have cultivated the practice and repetition needed to just know on a gut level the kinds of formal manipulations needed for precise and accurate proofs. but lean (combined with its incredibly well designed abbreviation expansion) gives probably the most intuitive way to manipulate formal mathematical expressions that you could hope to achieve with a keyboard.It provides tools for discovering relevant proofs, theorems, etc. Toying around with lean has actively taught me math that I didn't know before. The entire time it catches me any time I happen to fall into informal thinking and start making assumptions that aren't actually valid.I don't know of any way to extract the abbreviation engine that lean plugins use in the relevant editors for use in other contexts, but man, I'd honestly love it if I could type \\all or \\ne to get access to all of the mathematical unicode characters trivially. Or even extend it to support other unicode characters that I might find useful to type.reply",
      "Bessis [1] argues that formalism - or loosely math writing - is foundational to clarifying intuition/meaning in a way that natural language cannot. Imagine it as a scalpel carving out precise shapes from the blur of images we carry thereby allowing us to \"see\" things we otherwise cannot.I am curious to try out lean to understand how definitions in lean are able to operationally capture meaning in an unambiguous manner.[1] https://www.amazon.com/Mathematica-Secret-World-Intuition-Cu...reply",
      "For mathematics and certain fields, that is true. But the formalism matters, and as some have argued, the Fregean style that came to dominate in the 20th century is ill-suited for some fields, like linguistics. One argument is that linguists using this style inevitably recast natural language in the image of the formalism. (The traditional logical tradition is better suited, as its point of departure is the grammar of natural language itself.)No formalism is ontologically neutral in the sense that there is always an implied ontology or range of possible ontologies. And it is always important to make a distinction between the abstractions proper to the formalism and the object of study. A common fallacy involves reifying those abstractions into objects of the theory, at least implicitly.reply",
      "I just had a similar discussion with a coworker, he was advocating that LLMs are practically useful, but I argued they are kinda bad because nobody knows how they really work. I think it's somewhat return to pre-enlightenment situation where the expert authority was to be taken for their word, there was no way to externally verify their intuitive thought process, and I believe success of science and engineering is based on our formal understanding of the process and externalization of our thoughts.Similar in mathematics, formalization was driven by this concern, so that we wouldn't rely on potentially wrong intuition.I am now in favor of formalizing all serious human discourse (probably in some form of rich fuzzy and modal logic). I understand the concern for definition, but in communication, it's better to agree on the definition (which could be fuzzy) rather than use two random definitions and hope for their match. (I am reminded of koan about Sussman and Minsky http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/koans.html)For example, we could formally define an airplane as a machine that usually has wings, usually flies. This would be translated into a formula in fuzzy logic which would take, for a given object, our belief this object is a machine, has wings and flies, and would return how much it is an airplane under some notion of usually.I freely admit this approach wouldn't work for dadaist literary writers, but I don't want lawyers or politicians or scientists to be that.reply",

      "I\u2019ve long advocated that software engineers should read The Mythical Man-Month[0], but I believe it\u2019s more important now than ever.The last ~25 years or so have seen a drastic shift in how we build software, best trivialized by the shift from waterfall to agile.With LLM-aided dev (Codex and Claude Code), I find myself going back to patterns that are closer to how we built software in the 70s/80s, than anything in my professional career (last ~15 years).Some people are calling it \u201cspec-driven development\u201d but I find that title misleading.Thinking about it as surgery is also misleading, though Fred Brooks\u2019 analogy is still good.For me, it feels like I\u2019m finally able to spend time architecting the bridge/skyscraper/cathedral, without getting bogged down in terms of what bolts we\u2019re using, where the steel come from, or which door hinges to use.Those details matter, yes, but they\u2019re the type of detail that I can delegate now; something that was far too expensive (and/or brittle) before.[0]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Monthreply",
      "> bridge/skyscraper/cathedral> Those details matter, yes, but they\u2019re the type of detail that I can delegate nowNo...If you're building a skyscraper, there's no world where you can delegate where the steel or bolts come from. Or you'll at least need to care about what properties that exact steel has and guarantee every bit used on your project matches these constraints.If you don't want to care about those, build residential houses with 1000x less constraints and can be rebuilt on a dime comparatively.You might be thinking about interior decoration or floor arrangement ? Those were always a different matter left to the building owner to deal with.reply",
      "I think you're taking a metaphor a bit too literally.reply",
      "No, it's perfectly apt. One comment is stating that using LLMs allows them to gloss over the details. The responding comment is saying that glossing over details is not a great idea, actually. I think that statement holds up very well on both sides of the analogy. You can get away with glossing over certain details when building a little shed or a throwaway python script. If you're building a skyscraper or a full-fledged application being used in the real world by thousands or millions of people, those details being glossed over are the foundation of your entire architecture, will influence every other part of the decision-making process, and will cause everything to crumble if handled carelessly.reply",
      "Can you go into a bit more detail on your perspective of the 70s/80s approach vs. today? I\u2019m an analyst with a passion for engineering, but am not an engineer by trade. So honestly I am naive to how now would be different from the past.reply",
      "My take is that 70/80's built programs from a set of blueprints of what was required. Where each programmer had a set of requirements, knew what were required, when it is needed to be completed by and the tools available to enable the next level in development. If someone lagged behind then the project halted until but the end result was solidity and a completed application. At least during that time other programmers could improve their work and document.Meanwhile with agile, its always a race to me. If you didn't complete your part then spend a whole week focusing on it while the others carry on with anticipation that the sprint will result in completion of the part required. Enabling for the next part they've built to be integrated.Vibe coding offers this \"make a text box write to a file\" will produce the code but without any blueprints this starts to crumble when you proceed to introduce middleware such as authentication.Either because someone is lagging behind or it was never discussed on how authentication should be authenticated because someone is already that far ahead in their work. So you end up mashing more code together until it does work. It does and your product holds premise.The we'll improve, document and fix later never comes because of the request of features causing it to bloat. You're now bogged down in tech debt and so you spend resources in wrangling the mess with senior engineers.The senior engineers are now fixing the mess with their experienced code which doesn't integrate with the new features being built by the junior code. The seniors are now having to tidy that code leaving behind the real code they were originally tasked in improving turning the whole codebase in to something thats a diabolical mess but hey, it works.Hardware Resources are cheaper than refactoring so instead you then \"scale\" by throwing more hardware at it until it handles the pressure.Someone then leaves and knowledge share is lost. An exec allocates someone else from the group who was sane enough to keep all on-track to a senior role while skimping them on pay who are now handling the lost work, theirs and while keeping the team in track. The product starts to fail, new junior engineers are bought in with new naive wisdom, jumping up and down with the newest fancy library tech finally making the process complete, repeating itself.reply",
      "It's a nice analogy, and I think I'll use it in future.If you want another one, think of painting. An \"Old Master\" painter like Rembrandt or Rubens or Botticelli would have had a large workshop with a team of assistants, who would not only do a lot of the work like stretching canvases or mixing the paints, but would also - under the master's direction - actually do a lot of the painting too. You might have the master sketch out the composition, and then paint the key faces (and, most of all, the eyes) and then the assistants would fill in areas like drapery, landscape, etc.This changed in the Romantic period towards the end of the 1700s, with the idea of the individual artist, working alone in a moment of creative inspiration and producing a single work of genius from start to finish. Caspar David Friedrich or JMW Turner come to mind here.Some programmers want to be Turner and control the whole work and feel their creativity is threatened if a machine can now do parts of it as well as they could. I'd rather be Rembrandt and sketch out the outline, paint the eyes, and leave the rest to junior engineers... or an AI Agent. It's a matter of preference.reply",

Additionally, it's rarely able to fix it after I provide the error and even copy-past docs.Maybe I was just unlucky or you had better luck with another model. But I was very surprised to here this because Typst is my chief example for a language that  LLMs are bad at.reply",
      "This was a few months ago, but mainly Claude Sonnet 3.5 IIRC.You can't escape hallucinations, of course, but they can be mitigated somewhat. Don't ask it to generate a bunch of code at once. Feed it a snippet of code, and tell it precisely what you want it to do. These are general LLM rules applicable to any language and project, and I've had success with them with Typst. I also used it just to get explanations, or general ideas about how to do something, and then figure out the actual syntax and working code myself. It's strange that you haven't had luck with pasting docs. That has usually worked well for me.I also think that LLMs don't struggle as much with Typst because the language is relatively simple, and there is little bad and outdated content about it online, so they weren't trained on it. I assume that the API probably hasn't changed as much either and there haven't been many compatibility issues, so it's not as important which version the LLM was trained on.reply"

    "first_paragraph": "Typst 0.14 is out now. With accessibility by default, PDFs as images, character-level justification, and more, it has everything you need to move from draft to production.\nTypst's origins lie in academia, but over the past year, we've seen it expand to so much more. It's increasingly being used in the industry: For manually written documents, partially automated reports, and in fully automated batch PDF generation pipelines. Across these use cases, it's being used in production for critical documents.In August, we launched a new website to reflect Typst's expanding scope, and now, with Typst 0.14, we're shipping crucial features that make Typst even more widely applicable.If you need to comply with accessibility-related regulations, Typst 0.14 has your back. Typst now generates accessible documents by default, with opt-in support for stricter checks. For those working with complex illustrations, PDFs are now supported as a native image format. In case you're typesetting a book, the new"
