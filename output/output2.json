      "> The amount of cognitive overhead in this deceptively simple log is several levels deep: you have to first stop to type logger.info (or is it logging.info? I use both loguru and logger depending on the codebase and end up always getting the two confused.) Then, the parentheses, the f-string itself, and then the variables in brackets. Now, was it your_variable or your_variable_with_edits from five lines up? And what\u2019s the syntax for accessing a subset of df.head again?What you're describing is called: programming. This can't be serious. What about the cognitive overhead of writing a for loop? You have to remember what's in the array you're iterating over, how that array interacts with maybe other parts of the code base, and oh man, what about those pesky indices! Does it start at 0 or 1? I can't take it! AI save me!reply",

I just needed to copy / paste a few things. If it can do 90 - 95% of the time consuming work, that will save you a ton of time\"It feels like either finding that 2% that's off (or dealing with 2% error) will be the time consuming part in a lot of cases. I mean, this is nothing new with LLMs, but as these use cases encourage users to input more complex tasks, that are more integrated with our personal data (and at times money, as hinted at by all the \"do task X and buy me Y\" examples), \"almost right\" seems like it has the potential to cause a lot of headaches.

Something weird happened in America, maybe the Axe Body Spray takeover, where at least those with a working class upbringing thumbed our noses at such frivolous things but now I have come to appreciate fragrance a bit more.Funny enough, we actually randomly had dinner with the founder of a perfume shop who was visiting Paris with his wife and it was fascinating to learn a bit about the industry.reply",

I've had great experience with LuckyScent (mentioned in the article), Surrender to Chance, as well as random reddit swaps and highly rated Ebay sellers.The perfume scene is super wide and diverse, and I found that although there are general trends, it's hard to even know all the popular brands, and everyone's nose is unique. Skip stuff like Aventus and Sauvage and buy some discovery sets (surrender to chance puts together some good ones).There is definitely a spectrum between \"wearable crowd-pleaser\" and \"avant-garde storytelling\" - Afrika-Olifan comes to mind - love it for the creativity and execution, but it would be rude to go outside wearing it.

Only if we pinpoint what\u2019s unique to humans and fail to help other species develop it can we confidently claim Universal Grammar is correct.Personally, I think these innate features might not be entirely unique to humans. Even humans need sufficient social interaction and language exposure to truly behave like 'humans'. Feral children(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child), for example, behave much like animals. I also imagine early humans had only a few words and symbols and acted similarly. However, if feral children or ancient humans were exposed to today\u2019s social environment, they could likely learn our complex language quite quickly, because those words, symbols, and pronunciations are well-suited to humans for expressing our wills.Perhaps, we humans are just lucky to have found effective ways to express ourselves \u2014- symbols and words as we know them now -\u2014 and to pass them down through generations. This has allowed language and cognition to grow exponentially, giving us an edge over other species.P.S. Our failure so far to teach animals structured language is exactly why I admire projects like Google\u2019s Dolphin Gemma. To succeed, we need to tailor teaching methods to their species-specific traits\u2014starting by understanding how they express their intentions/wills, and then hopefully helping enrich their naming systems and overall communication.

Using a generalization of the XOR trick [1], all the values that are identical cancel out, so the size of this data structure depends only on the size of the difference.Most explanations of Invertible Bloom Filters start with standard Bloom filters, which support two operations: insert and maybeContains. Next, they extend to counting Bloom filters, which enables a delete operation.

      "We already have something that resembles a basic income in developed countries. It's called retirement pensions. And what we see there is that most people, as soon as they are eligible for their pension, they stop working. Sure, they may volunteer a few hours a month here and there, but their productivity plummets compared to the previous year when they didn't collect that pension. I don't blame them one bit -- it's exactly the same thing I did once I retired.So what happens as we lower the age at which they receive a pension? Different countries and companies have sometimes offered pensions to some of their senior workers to reduce their workforce -- the results were the same. Most people stop working as soon as they have a lifetime guaranteed income that allows them to afford life's essentials, even if they are in their forties.A pilot where the participants know or suspect that the money will soon stop flowing won't capture the real-world effect of this decades-long experiment that we call pensions.And if people don't work, or don't work nearly as much as they did before, then how is the system going to be sustained?reply",

      "As a self taught developer who has spent most of their career in the big corporate world surrounded by computer science graduates my experience is this:The self taught developer will eventually figure it out, if they are intelligent enough to approach the given problem.The computer science graduate will generally not even try to figure out a problem in completely unfamiliar territory. Of course this varies by personality, so this is probably only true for about 85% of the computer science graduates. They cannot proceed in the face of high uncertainty.What that ultimately means is that the computer science graduate is way more compatible in the big corporate world where they are an interchangeable cog that can be replaced at any moment. They operate in a world on known patterns just like their peers. The self taught developer, however, is constantly innovating and doing things in somewhat original ways because they have learned to not waste their personal time on unnecessary repetition, and that cavalier lone gunman attitude scares the shit out of people. Yet, those self-taught people tend to deliver vastly superior results.Most developers don\u2019t seem to care about superior code.

Deno and Bun are ahead of Node on several different axes, and other runtimes are coming, too \u2014 if Node can catch up, then great, but if it can't, then it should rightly be left behind.)There's still no real alternative to Node for many large frontend apps in production, but for a lot of other TypeScript use cases \u2014 build tooling, backend APIs, CLI apps, edge functions \u2014 modern TypeScript in the Deno/Bun style (ESM, full filename imports, run/typecheck/lint/test with no user-configured build step) has significant benefits.Both Deno and Bun have extensive \u2014 and necessary \u2014 backward compatibility shims to enable interoperability with what I've started calling \"legacy Node JS/TS\". You can use the Node APIs (but should explicitly import those things with \"node:\"  in your import specifier. You can use NPM packages (even CommonJS ones, although Deno prohibits CommonJS in new code, a stricter line than Bun draws).I don't think using Deno and Bun is a huge bet on those specific (VC-backed) runtimes, either, because there is a shared vision of what \"modern TypeScript\" looks like, it works with both of those tools, and I think there will be multiple runtimes that support that vision for as long as TypeScript is relevant, even if both Deno and Bun were to go sideways.Whether Node itself will become one of those modern runtimes is an interesting question.

      "Mesoamerica had both wheels and bronze. They just weren't as widely used because the technologies weren't nearly as useful in the Mesoamerican social context.Human sacrifice occurred and had important religious connotations (in terms of very literally keeping the universe alive), but it's wildly over-stated as an everyday fact of life by chroniclers.reply",

      "His book is excellent for dispelling myths of the noble savage. These were not angelic tribes of peaceful hunter-gatherers, living off the land in harmony with nature, but human beings with complex motivations and driven by the same things that drive all of us.reply"

Because, you know, nothing screams \"career peak\" like uncovering a thousand-year-old skeleton wearing some fancy jadeite bling. Meanwhile, the armchair Indiana Joneses in the comments rehash their vacation snaps and boast about braving the \u2018difficult\u2019 road to Caracol, as if surviving potholes is on par with real archaeological fieldwork.

      "If I'm reading this right, which is hard because most of the information is missing... The whole project is $3B. Someone else is kicking in $1.5B, $618M has already been spent, so maybe completion requires $872M and not completion takes $618M. Or maybe $618M was spent of the outside contribution, so it's $1.5B to complete and $618M to cancel?If the state doesn't have the money, cancellation sounds less expensive than completion, in the short term. Of course, the costs for not doing the coastal repairs will continue to acrue, but if there's no money, there's no money?reply"

    "summary": "Louisiana, in a blaze of glory typically reserved for less financially soluble entities like bank-rupt casinos or starry-eyed tech startups, decides $3B is too rich for their blood, cancelling a crucial coastal repair project funded by the BP oil spill settlement. Commenters, flexing their economic acumen gleaned from the back of a cereal box, argue passionately about whether it's cheaper to waste $618M now or just tuck tail and run from the entire $3B. Governor Landry, environmental strategist extraordinaire, bravely defends the \"state\u2019s way of life\" (a phrase here meaning to staunchly ignore impending ecological doom while drowning in both water and debt). It's a masterclass in fiscal prudence and forward-thinking governance\u2014cue the sarcasm. \ud83d\ude0f"
