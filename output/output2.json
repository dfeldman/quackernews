      "Thanks for working on this! Language learning really needs a breakthrough.Now, I tried the web app and chose to learn Greek as a beginner. And while I had better experience with your app than with ChatGPT or Gemini voice modes, I still got lost 5 minutes in because the AI tutor doesn't seem to have a plan for me, nor does it \"see\" my struggles. For example, after asking me about a hobby, it gives me a long sentence in Greek about how how it is nice to hike in mountains. Being absolute noob I cannot reply to it, nor even repeat it. And I don't even know what it is expected from me at the moment. A human tutor here would probably repeat a part of the sentence with a translation and ask me to repeat, or would explain something. The AI just sits there waiting for me to make a sound, and when I make it, it goes on on a tangental subject of beach vacations. :)Again, this is still relatively not bad, and I'm going to give it another try.reply",

It isn't really much different than conversing with ChatGPT in advanced voice mode - it's up to me to drive the conversation and it all feels quite arbitrary (and I find myself instinctively falling back on topics I know how to talk about, which quite defeats the purpose). I was hoping for a more structured learning plan that strategically expands my comfort zone and skills in a guided way.reply",

      "I'm an advanced learner but I stopped after a few moments because it's boring. It's asking me questions that you'd ask a beginner (although a beginner wouldn't understand the questions). It just asked what food I like to eat, where I like to travel, whether I like the weather, etc. I have a language tutor IRL and I have found that we run out of things to talk about too. So we often find ourselves just discussing the latest events from the news. I think you should feed fresh conversation topics daily from a data source like the news, localized to the user. There are global news APIs you can subscribe to.reply",
      "Do you mean that the experience is meant to have more structure if you pick the intermediate or advanced level? (fwiw I did pick intermediate for my Swedish level in the app).My thinking is - I can have unstructured conversations with Advanced Voice Mode or in real life here in Sweden. What I'd really appreciate is a guided learning experience taking me up from intermediate/slightly above intermediate to fluent in the most efficient possible way (as opposed to just having us 'ramble' about random topics of my own choosing).reply",

Polyfills are another example.If a proposal like this succeeds, it lives a time in the sun, but then spends most of its useful life being the old thing that people are trying to work around, just like the DOM API, just like ECMA versions, just like old browsers, just like every other useful bit of tech that is part of the system but can't be touched.Is it possible to think about entropy, extension and backcompat as primary use cases?reply",

And why so many designers learn with tools like photoshop.Also hard not to feel like this is reaching hard to try and recreate xslt.  :(  It is inevitable that someone will want to template something that isn't well formed, but can combine into a well formed thing.  And then you are stuck trying to find how to do it.  (Or correlated entities on a page that are linked, but not on the same tree, as it were.  Think \"label\" and \"for\" as an easy example in plain markup.)If I could wave my magic wand, what we need is fewer attempts to make templates all fit in with the rube goldberg that is the standard document layout for markup.  People will go through obscene lengths to recreate what judicious use of absolute positioning can achieve fairly well.  Sure, you might have to do math to get things to fit, but why do we feel that is something that we have to force the machine to do again and again and again on the same data?reply",

      "There are a number of these out there, and this one has a super easy setup and appears to Just Work, so nice job on that. I had it going and producing plausible results within a minute or so.One thing I'm wondering is if there's anyone doing this at scale? The issue I see is that with complex workflows which take several dozen steps and have complex control flow, the probability of reaching the end falls off pretty hard,  because if each step has a .95 chance of completing successfully, after not very many steps you have a pretty small overall probability of success. These use cases are high value because writing a traditional scraper is a huge pain, but we just don't seem to be there yet.The other side of the coin is simple workflows, but those tend to be the workflows where writing a scraper is pretty trivial. This did work, and I told it to search for a product at a local store, but the program cost $1.05 to run. So doing it at any scale quickly becomes a little bit silly.So I guess my question is: who is having luck using these tools, and what are you using them for?One route I had some success with is writing a DSL for scraping and then having the llm generate that code, then interpreting it and editing it when it gets stuck. But then there's the \"getting stuck detection\" part which is hard etc etc.reply",
      "Glad you were able to get it set up quickly!We currently are optimizing for reliability and quality, which is why we suggest Claude - but it can get expensive in some cases. Using Qwen 2.5-VL-72B will be significantly cheaper, though may not be always reliable.Most of our usage right now is for running test cases, and people seem to often prefer qwen for that use case - since typically test cases are clearer how to execute.Something that is top of mind for is is figuring out a good way to \"cache\" workflows that get taken. This way you can repeat automations either with no LLM or with a smaller/cheap LLM. This will would enable deterministic, repeatable flows, that are also very affordable and fast. So even if each step on the first run is only 95% reliable - if it gets through it, it could repeat it with 100% reliability.reply",

      "Both of them are \"visually grounded\" - meaning if you ask for the location of something in an image - they can output the exact x/y pixel coordinates! Not many models can do this, especially not many that are large enough to actually reason through sequences of actions wellreply",
      "Using this for testing instead of regular playwright must 10000x the cost and speed, doesn't it? At which points do the benefits outweigh the costs?reply",
      "I think depends a lot on how much you value your own time, since its quite time consuming to write and update playwright scripts. It's gonna save you developer hours to write automations using natural language rather than messing around with and fixing selectors. It's also able to handle tasks that playwright wouldn't be able to do at all - like extracting structured data from a messy/ambiguous DOM and adapting automatically to changing situations.You can also use cheaper models depending on your needs, for example Qwen 2.5 VL 72B is pretty affordable and works pretty well for most situations.reply",
      "But we can use an LLM to write that script though and give that agent access to a browser to find DOM selectors etc. And than we have a stable script where we, if needed, manually can fix any LLM bugs just once\u2026? I\u2019m sure there are use cases with messy selectors as you say, but for me it feels like most cases are better covered by generating scripts.reply",
      "Yeah we've though about this approach a lot - but the problem is if your final program is a brittle script, you're gonna need a way to fix it again often - and then you're still depending on recurrently using LLMs/agents. So we think its better to have the program itself be resilient to change instead of you/your LLM assistant having to constantly ensure the program is working.reply",
      "Why not just use Claude by itself? Opus and Sonnet are great at producing pixel coordinates and tool usages from screenshots of UIs. Curious as to what your framework gives me over the plain base model.reply",
      "Hey! To have a framework that can effectively control browser agents, you need systems to interact with the browser, but also pass relevant content from the page to the LLM. Our framework manages this agent loop in a way that enables flexible agentic execution that can mix with your own code - giving you control but in a convenient way.

The ROMs and system software substitutes were all written in a clean room--no disassembly of the Apple ROMs or System file.Although Executor ostensibly has a Linux port, it's probably hard to build (I haven't tried in a couple decades) in part because to squeeze the maximum performance out of a 80386 processor, the synthetic CPU relied on gcc-specific extensions.I know a fair amount about Executor, because I wrote the initial version of it, although all the super impressive parts (e.g., the synthetic 68k emulator and the color subsystem) were written by better programmers than I am.reply",

I hope that day will come, but my hope is fading.reply",
      "What would you say the delta is between Element's current video-rooms and Discord-style voice-rooms (if you go and mute video for everyone), ooi?  The only reason Element hasn't implemented precisely the same UI as Discord is because it's not (currently) trying to be a Discord competitor, but more a \"run your own encrypted Teams alternative\", given that's what Element customers are asking for right now, and we're having to follow the money to try to get sustainable.  However, what we're trying to do is to ensure that Discordish features still work, despite having to focus more on Teamsish features.In terms of permissions: I'm a bit surprised that folks feel limited by Matrix's freeform hierarchy of permissions.  Every user can have a 'power level' from 0 to 100, and you can then customise the threshold required for literally permission (e.g. you need power level 54 or higher to kick users, or whatever).  The only difference with Discord is that Discord lets you pick entirely arbitrary combinations of permissions (e.g. have one user able to kick but not ban, but another user able to ban but not kick, or whatever).  How useful really is this in real life usage though?I'm trying to work out whether the problem is if Element's UI for configuring permissions is too basic, or whether folks really do need a full RBAC permission matrix, and if so, for what use case?reply",
      "The power level model of permissions feels to me a bit overly simplified. It\u2019s so easy to imagine scenarios where you need exceptions to the rule of permissions existing on a single axis that it seems very limiting from the outset.The idea of ever increasing and overlapping scopes I don\u2019t think maps well to most people\u2019s mental model of who should be allowed to do what. People mostly want to define an arbitrary role; admin, user, team leader, whatever, and just pick what that role is allowed to do in isolation. It\u2019s marginally more work to setup initially picking all of the permissions again, but it removes all of the overhead of having to monitor what permissions are being adopted from lower scopes on the power level axis.I also think the power level system makes it much harder to \u201crefactor\u201d permissions for specific roles without affecting permissions for everyone \u201cabove and below\u201dreply",
      "the discord style permissions are simply easier to understand. it's classic role based. you define the roles, and assign the roles to users. matrix permissions forces a hierarchy that is awkward and more difficult to apply because i have to force permissions into a hierarchy. on discord i don't have to think about the hierarchy.reply",

Aerospikes can work with rdes potentially if the certain versions catch on, but at the end of the day the heat fluxes are even worse for the detonation based engines.

Probably the whole reason we got the patents, truly.SSTOs are, like everything else going to orbit, delimited by weight.If you are going to make the fuel tanks internal to the vehicle and not something that falls off and sheds their weight mid-flight, you have to get vehicle weight to the absolute minimum. Losing weight has second order effects because it means you now have to carry less fuel so you now have a smaller fuel tank which means the tank weighs less which means you get to carry less fuel\u2026 etc.The key, IMO, is material science advancements, specifically around plastics and composites. Very efficient engine design is matters too, but if you can just bring less mass up with you you can start to approach an achievable fuel weight.It\u2019s a hard job, you need plastics that can handle orbital temperature cycling (+300 to -300 F every 30 mins), atomic oxygen (nasty corrosion), UV with no atmospheric protection, FST for crew exposure\u2026Exotic metal alloys can get you around some of these problems, but they can be difficult and expensive to work with. Same issue with high-performance polymers. No free lunches here.With 3D printing of metals and high-performance composites, you can probably remove additional weight so there\u2019s some light in that tunnel.But all in all it\u2019s very hard to get out of the gravity well with your fuel in tow and survive the extremes of space. My belief is the first vehicle to pull it off will look like a Swiss cheese of voids and lattices from printing / honeycombs and be made almost entirely out of plastic and carbon fiber.reply",
      "The 1990s were a lost decade for reusable space flight because instead of chasing incremental improvements to the Space Shuttle (an orbiter with reusable tiles that could be turned around in days,  not months) or something like the Falcoln 9 or the fly-back version of Saturn V that O'Neill's students drew in 1979, it was all about SSTO.SSTO is just marginally possible,  if it is possible you need exotic materials and engines and you're never going to get a good payload fraction and adding wings, horizontal takeoff, horizontal landing and such just makes it worse.  The one good thing about it is that you get closer to \"aircraft-like operations\" because in principle you can inspect it,  refill it,  and relaunch it -- whereas something like the STS or Falcoln 9 or Starship will require stacking up multiple parts for each launch.My guess is aerospikes are making a comeback though because of interest in hypersonic weapons system.  I could also see them being useful for the second stage of something like Starship which mostly operates at high altitudes but has to land at low altitudes.  There are a lot of other technical problems,  like the thermal management system,  which really have to be solved before worrying about that optimization.reply",
      "> SSTO is just marginally possible, if it is possibleLooking at the specs it would appear the first stage of a Falcon 9 plus a nosecone could get itself to orbit with no cargo. Barely.reply",
      "Currently the Starship upper stage simply has two different sets of bell nozzles: Three engines with nozzles for atmospheric pressure, and three for vacuum. I wonder how inefficient this really is compared to having just aerospike nozzles.reply",

SSTOs are a concept, but given their complete lack of market share, I assume as a non-aerospace engineer that there are valid reasons smart people have not been able to design a competitive one yet.Similarly, I assume there are valid reasons SpaceX has chosen not to use aerospike Raptors, especially given their well-earned reputation for innovating things everyone else swore couldn't be done.

    "summary": "**The Great Aerospike Nozzle Discourse: Hot Gas and Wishful Thinking**\n\nIn a dazzling display of academic verbosity, an article on MDPI attempts to school the masses about the \"trends\" in aerospike nozzle applications. Everyone\u2019s supposed aerospace saviors, aerospike nozzles, turn out to be a lesson in overly ambitious engineering and cooling nightmares, reminding burgeoning rocket scientists why we can't have nice things. Commenters, armed with Google degrees, gloriously tussle over concepts like rotating detonation engines, shedding light on the universal truth that adding complexity often solves nothing beyond creating great fodder for comment wars. Meanwhile, mentions of Single-Stage-to-Orbit (SSTO) lead to the nostalgic yet painful recall of the VentureStar, showcasing humanity's persistent flirtation with 'innovative failure'. Amidst this tumult of technological fantasies and thermodynamics, the only consensus is that real rocket science might just be too hot to handle \u2014literally and figuratively."

      "This is a pretty big deal. Decreasing bottom-of-the food chain biomass like diatoms and dinoflagellates in the context of climate change is a pretty big problem. These guys are everywhere, in fresh- and saltwater bodies, all over the planet. Disruption of them has implications vis a vis carbon sequestration (they die, their shells sink, and get buried at the bottom), but most importantly, every other species of animal in the ocean is dependent on them. It's food chain  101 stuff. Fish like, say, sardines, that filter feed on these guys may not have their populations do so well if there are big decreases, or, as the article suggests, increases and decreases in areas where this historically doesn't happen, and thus other species that feed on them cannot adapt.Also, things won't get better unless some really big changes are made (i.e, actually combating climate change). Or, as the article so succinctly puts it:> Assuming the underlying mechanisms do not change, the next few decades could bring further decreases in diatom and dinoflagellate biomass, with a shift towards diatoms in much of the North Atlantic and a shift towards dinoflagellates in the Arctic. These changes have likely had notable consequences for carbon export and the amount of biomass transferred up the food web.reply",

Think about last time twitter or slack went down. How irritated you felt.We aim to solve this problem by providing software engineers better tooling to keep systems running smoothly. We believe there are lots to be done in this space and we need your help in building this future.If you are developer who loves talking to people, writing about what you are building and help ot",

Join the \"global\" team as they bravely count users in 30+ countries while yearning for someone who can actually explain what they do. Desperate to keep their Slack community and all 150 contributors from falling into existential despair, they seek a DevRel Engineer who loves talking, tweeting, and possibly debugging live on Zoom.

      "Several years ago (around 2015), I also developed a typing learning web application. It was inspired by another application that had originally been developed for Windows 95 - with that app, I learned how to type. So in 2015, I decided to implement a web-based version of it.http://touchtyper.net/enHowever, I just checked out keybr.com and have to say - it's a much better system for learning to type! As of today, I now realize I have a huge problem with the letter \"q\" - I had never noticed that before! ^^reply",
      "keybr's algorithm is flawed, getting 1 extra WPM on \"q\" does way less progress than getting 1 extra WPM on \"e\", it's better than most of the things but also I wouldn't have made typr if it was perfect.reply",
      "Btw, I also checked out your app, my feedback after 5 minutes: there was at least one case, where a word was splitted instead of clean word wrapping for line break, when the terminal is small.And one idea: do a audio bell on error, even for tui, this should just be the special \"bell control char\" written to stdout.reply",
      "Thanks for the idea, added to roadmap!reply",
      "One issue with tools like these is that it's pretty artificial. You rarely need to type nonsense series of lowercase only words without punctuation at a consistent character speed.I did a similar little tool at some point where I just used some books from the gutenberg project and normalised it a bit so there were no weird typographic quotes etc.It both forces me to become good at the punctuation, and it's more interesting as I will accidentally start reading that book.reply",
      "I couldn\u2019t agree more on this honestly.https://www.typequicker.com kinda focuses on this sentiment. AI generated natural text that targets user weak points.The more you type, the better the targeted exercises are.The whole app essentially focuses on natural text (except for drills)reply",
      "I like this one https://typeonline.uk/speed-test/wordreply",
      "I love this! Reminded me of TypeLit.io [1]. I would love something similar for programming: typing out snippets of code, that make sense, to improve typing speed involving special characters and symbols. Maybe selecting code snippets from popular open-source projects and presenting them to the user is a good start!1. https://www.typelit.io/reply",
      "Thank you! :)Yes!! I have this on my todo list (along with many other features I've always wanted) actually!reply",
