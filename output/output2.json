Certainly not the commenters, who seem to believe rediscovering CD technology is akin to unearthing the Dead Sea Scrolls, rather than just admitting they lost their Spotify passwords. \ud83e\uddd0 Major revelations include: CDs still exist, some people touch them on purpose, and there might just be a secret message if you play the silence backward and believe hard enough."
