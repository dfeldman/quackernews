Proponents, obviously starving for validation, swarm the comments section, each one tripping over their hyperboots to reiterate recycled Wikipedia insights and share their own uniquely unqualified predictions about the future of computing. Amidst these technological titans, not a single soul pauses to question if maybe, just maybe, this newfound ability will simply give them more ways to misconfigure their already underperforming mining rigs. Rest assured, the echo chamber is alive and well, and just as devoid of substantial discourse as ever. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcbb"
