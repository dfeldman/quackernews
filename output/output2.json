      "There's also a big lithium deposit in Nevada, and preparations for mining are underway there.[1] General Motors put in $650 million for guaranteed access to the output of this Thacker Mine.It's in a caldera in a mountain that I-80 bypassed to go through Winnemuca, Nevada. Nearest town is Mill City, NV, which is listed as a ghost town, despite being next to I-80 and a main line railroad track.\nThe mine site is about 12km from Mill City on a dirt road not tracked by Google Street View.Google Earth shows signs of development near Mill City. Looks like a trailer park and a truck stop. The road to the mine looks freshly graded. Nothing at the mine site yet.It's a good place for a mine. There are no neighbors for at least 10km, but within 15km, there's good road and rail access.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thacker_Pass_lithium_mine\n \nreply",
      "Your description of the location of this mine doesn't match your Wikipedia link.Searching in Google Maps, Thacker Mine comes up as 40.58448942010599, -117.8912129833345.  As you say, that is near I-80 and Mill City, and there is nothing there.But Wikipedia says it's at 41.70850912415866, -118.05475061324945 in the McDermitt Caldera, nowhere near Mill City or I-80.I'm thinking probably don't trust Google on this one.  :)\n \nreply",
      "Right. The Nevada Appeal, which actually has people on the ground, has far more info.[1] North of Thacker Pass is the area to look. The mine is building their own rail yard west of Winnemuca. The mine will be an open-pit mine like a coal mine. Sawtooth Mining division of North American Coal will do the mining. Dig down 350 feet, take out clay with lithium, process, put back clay without lithium. \nThe processing plant will be at Thacker Pass. Big plant, maybe 1800 people. \nLithium in clay is a new thing - the usual input is brine. Also a sulfuric acid plant, a power plant, housing, etc.  Project assumes a loan of US$2.3 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy.\"Lithium Americas will contract with a bus company to drive workers an hour to the site for 10-hour work shifts, he added. An additional two hours will be added for transportation time.\nIf you go to work on our project, you will have free room and board and free transportation to the site every day. You would get three free meals a day.\" If you're an unemployed coal miner in West Virginia, that might look good.[1] https://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/2024/oct/12/nevada-operati...\n \nreply",
      "Looks like Google got \"Thacker Pass Lithium Mine\" in the McDermitt Caldera confused with an old gold mine called \"Thacker Placer Mine\" that was southeast of Mill City: https://westernmininghistory.com/mine-detail/10042614/\n \nreply",
      "Yeah I asked Google Gemini to make a map showing the three principle lithium developments of Nevada and it pinned the historical Thacker Mine, not the new Thacker Pass Mine.Then I asked chatgpt and it refused to make a map but said that I should just look on the map for Thacker Pass, which is almost right but it also said I should look northeast of Winnemucca, which isn't correct. It's north and west.Zero for two, for robots.\n \nreply",
      "From the paper's method section, a bit more about which type of ML algo was used:An RF machine-learning model was developed to predict lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines throughout southern Arkansas. The model was developed by (i) assigning explanatory variables to brine samples collected at wells, (ii) tuning the RF model to make predictions at wells and assess model performance, (iii) mapping spatially continuous predictions of lithium concentrations across the Reynolds oolite unit of the Smackover Formation in southern Arkansas, and (iv) inspecting the model for explanatory variable importance and influence. Initial model tuning used the tidymodels framework (52) in R (53) to test XGBoost, K-nearest neighbors, and RF algorithms; RF models consistently had higher accuracy and lower bias, so they were used to train the final model and predict lithium.Explanatory variables used to tune the RF model included geologic, geochemical, and temperature information for Jurassic and Cretaceous units. The geologic framework of the model domain is expected to influence brine chemistry both spatially and with depth. Explanatory variables used to train the RF model must be mapped across the model domain to create spatially continuous predictions of lithium. Thus, spatially continuous subsurface geologic information is key, although these digital resources are often difficult to acquire.Interesting to me that RF performed better the XGBoost, would have expected at least a similar outcome if tuned correctly.\n \nreply",
      "So it turns out that there's no theoretical reason that gradient boosting will always outperform RF (which would violate the \"no free lunch\" theorem). But it does usually seem to be the case in practice, even with small and noisy data.I would hazard a guess that with better tuning, XGBoost would still have won. (The paper notes that the authors chose a suboptimal set of hyperparameters out of fear of overfitting - maybe the same logic justifies choosing a suboptimal model type...)\n \nreply",
      "That's been my experience. RF tends to do quite well out of the box, and is very fast to fit. It's less of a pain to cross-validate too, with fewer tuning parameters. XGBoost has a huge number of knobs to tune, and its performance varies from god-awful with bad hyperparameters to somewhat better than RF with good ones. Giant PITA with nested cross-validation, etc. though.I haven't read in detail what their validation strategy is but this seems like the kind of problem where it's not so easy as you'd think -- you need to be very careful about how you stratify your train, dev, and test sets. A random 80/10/10 split would be way too optimistic: your model would just learn to interpolate between geographically proximate locations. You'd probably need to cross-validate across different geographic areas.This also seems like an application that would benefit from \"active learning\". given that drilling and testing is expensive, you'd want to choose where to collect new data based on where it would best update your model's accuracty. A similar-ish ML story comes from Flint, MI [1] though the ending is not so happy[1] https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/01/how-m...\n \nreply",
      "Put another way, this is pretty similar to the interpolation approaches that would normally be used for datasets like this in the world of mineral exploration. Kriging/co-kriging (i.e. gaussian processes) is the more commonly used approach in this particular field due to both the long history and the available hyperparameters for things like spatial aniostropy.However, kriging is really quite difficult to use with non-continuous inputs. RF is a lot more forgiving there. You don't need to develop a covariance model for discrete values (or a covariance model for how the different inputs relate, either).\n \nreply",

I have found many books that are \"snippet view\" only on Google Books but freely visible on HathiTrust.If you are a student or researcher at one of the participating HathiTrust institutions, you can also get access to scans of books that are still in copyright.The one advantage Google Books still has is that its search tools are much faster and sometimes better, so it can be useful to search for phrases or topics on Google Books and then jump over to HathiTrust to read specific books surfaced by the search.[1] https://www.hathitrust.org/\n \nreply",
      "HathiTrust is a fine example of a repository which is in theory useful but in practice all but useless.Participation is limited to tertiary academic institutions, and possibly only four-year (rather than two-year) ones.  This excludes local (city/county) libraries, as well as primary/secondary (grammar / middle / high school in the US) libraries.Even public-domain records cannot be downloaded in whole, but rather can be saved one page at a time as PDFs.  I'm pretty sure that those interested in more useful archival will and/or have created automated tools to do so, but HathiTrust remains the most notable point-of-access for such works, and the additional generation of conversion and republication further degrades the quality of original-publication formats.  (It's less a problem for regenerated works from OCR'd or manually-converted documents, but those of course lose all the characteristics of original publication.)And of course, many materials still under copyright are not accessible to the general public at all, no matter how obscure.  I'd run into a case of this some months back trying to get a date attribution of an Alan Watts lecture which had been posted to HN:<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41231047> (thread).And my request still stands.

In my opinion Kahle was wrong; the existence of one orphan works clearinghouse would have encouraged Congress to grant more libraries access instead of doing nothing which is what actually happened in the 15 year since then. Instead of one company selling out-of-print but in-copyright books, or multiple organizations, no one is allowed to sell them today.Since then, of course, Brewster Kahle launched an e-library of copyrighted books without legal authorization anyway which will probably be the death of the current organization that runs the Internet Archive.

      "After years of working with web frameworks in Python and Java, and then picking up Go along the way, I've come to appreciate Go's approach much more. That is, with a rich and capable standard library, you really don't need traditional frameworks. Need an HTTP server, router, etc.? Use stdlib. Need templates? Use stdlib. Need an ORM? You don't, but you may want to consider a small 3rd party query builder library of your choice. And so on.This avoids depending on a complex framework that may or may not exist in a few years, improves security by minimizing the amount of 3rd party dependencies, keeps the learning curve low for any new developers joining the project, and is more flexible and easier to maintain. I don't have experience with Rust, and judging by the comments here, web frameworks might still be useful for it. Which is a shame, since the batteries included stdlib approach is far superior IME.Anyway, I don't want to shoot down your efforts. Congrats on the launch and good luck!\n \nreply",

It has allowed us to scale performance all while allowing us to build more products on the same set of data.Since we've been using ClickHouse long before this JSON functionality was available (or even before the earlier version of this called `Object('json')` was avaiable) we ended up setting up a job that would materialize json fields out of a json blob and into materialized columns based on query patterns against the keys in the JSON blob. Then, once those materialized columns were created we would just route the queries to those columns at runtime if they were available. This saved us a _ton_ on CPU and IO utilization.

      "Hi! I'm one of the authors of this feature. It's something quite novel, because it's not just a HNSW plug-in for MySQL (like e.g. pgvector is for Postgres). It's a fully transactional index, integrated into InnoDB.We based the implementation on two very new papers from Microsoft Research, SPANN and SPFresh. SPANN is a hybrid graph/tree algorithm that does a fantastic job of scaling larger-than-RAM indexes (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08566) and SPFresh expands upon it by defining a set of background operations that can be performed to maintain the index's performance and recall while it's continuously updated in-place (https://arxiv.org/html/2410.14452v1). The novel thing here is designing all the SPANN _and_ SPFresh operations to be transactional, and integrating them in MySQL's default storage engine.This tight integration fundamentally means that inserting, updating and deleting vector data from MySQL is always reflected immediately in the index as part of committing your transaction. But it also means that the indexes are fully covered by the MySQL binlog; they recover from hard crashes just fine. They're also managed by MySQL's buffer pool, so they scale to terabytes of data, just like any other table. And also crucially, they're fully integrated with the query planner, so they can be used in any query, including JOINs and WHERE clauses (something that many other vector indexes really struggle with).We plan to release a whitepaper on our transactionality extensions to SPFresh, which I think will be super interesting, but meanwhile please feel free to test the beta and ask me any questions (here, or by emailing PlanetScale support). Thanks!\n \nreply",
      "Will this be open sourced and be upstreamed to MySQL? Or will it always be Planetscale specific?\n \nreply",
      "very cool stuff! I just read the SPFresh paper a few days ago and was wondering if it's been implemented in industry (e.g. Turbopuffer's implementation of SPANN).I'd be curious how y'all represent the posting lists for each partition in InnoDB:- what IDs are you storing in the posting lists?- how are the posting lists represented on disk? are they using compression and/or some form of skip indexing? the paper seemed to use a pretty simple block-based representation, but I'm curious what works well in practice.- how do the posting list data structures themselves handle incremental updates and MVCC?\n \nreply",
      "These are very relevant questions! Thank you!We're storing IDs from a ghost column that is created in the table where you're inserting vector data. This works very well in practice and allows updating the value of the vectors in the table, because they're translated into a delete + insert in the vector index by updating the ghost ID.We have abstracted away the quantization system from the index; for the initial release, vector data is stored in raw blocks, like in the paper. Query performance is good, but disk usage is high. We're actively testing different quantization algorithms to see which ones we end up offering on GA. We're hoping our beta users will help us guide this choice!Incremental updates and MVCC are _extremely tricky_, for both correctness and performance. As you've surely noticed, the hard thing here is that the original paper is very focused on LSM trees, because it exploits the fact that LSM trees get compacted lazily to perform incremental updates to the posting lists ('merges'). MySQL (and Postgres, and all relational databases, really) are B-tree based, and in-place updates for B-trees are expensive! I think we came up with very interesting workarounds for the problem, but it's a quite a bit to drill down in a HN comment. Please stay tuned for our whitepaper. :)\n \nreply",
      "looking forward to it!I'd be curious if y'all end up supporting adding filter attributes to the inverted index that can then be pushed down into the posting list traversal.for example, a restaurant search app may have (1) an embedding for each restaurant but also (2) a cuisine. then, if a restaurant has `cuisine = Italian`, we'd also store its ghost ID in a `cuisine:Italian` posting list.at query time, the query planner could take a query like `SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' ORDER BY DISTANCE(..)` and emit a plan that efficiently intersects the `cuisine:Italian` posting list with the union of the partitions' posting lists.this feels to me like a potential strength of the inverted indexing approach compared to graph-based approaches, which struggle with general filtering (e.g. the Filtered-DiskANN paper).\n \nreply",

Not only do I not know enough at that point in time to even review the app, but if I was so inclined to click through at that moment it would have been to leave a review complaining about the practice rather than saying anything substantive about the app's functionality. But even when they're not that bad, they're almost always popping up when I open the app (the moment when I'm specifically intending to do something that I'm now being interrupted) or in the middle of some workflow. It's the same annoying behavior that web pop-up folks used to do too.Personally, I'd rather see you add a small UI element somewhere, or a banner that appears briefly but critically doesn't cover up any controls. If you absolutely MUST use a pop up, you know when the best time to do that is? After I've completed some in app purchase. If I'm spending money on your product, chances are I'm moderately satisfied with it and feeling pretty good about it at that moment. Or if you don't have in app purchases, unless you've made a \"content browsing only\" app, you probably have some workflows that have a definite end state. Prompt me then, at the end of me doing what I've come to your app to do. But I've never once given a review / stars to any app that has interrupted me in the middle of or at the start of doing something.\n \nreply",

      "It\u2019s only a guess, but I don\u2019t think data is on your side. I seriously doubt that appreciative users \u201cwill, of their own accord with your nagging\u201d rate apps. I\u2019d bet it\u2019s less than 2% who do\n \nreply",
      "Yeah the comment reads as originating from a person who has never tried to sell something. You need to ask to get attention",
      "Yeah I understand this and definitely do not retaliate against being asked for reviews. I find the usual modal pop-up for a review can be a bit jarring or appear at inopportune moments though, i wonder if not using modals would be better.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "A federal rule banning fake online reviews is now in effectWASHINGTON -- A federal rule banning fake online reviews is now in effect. The Federal Trade Commission issued the rule in August banning the sale or purchase of online reviews. The rule, which went into effect Monday, allows the agency to seek civil penalties against those who knowingly violate it.\u201cFake reviews not only waste people\u2019s time and money, but also pollute the marketplace and divert business away from honest competitors,\u201d FTC Chair Lina Khan said about the rule in August. She added that the rule will \u201cprotect Americans from getting cheated, put businesses that unlawfully game the system on notice, and promote markets that are fair, honest, and competitive.\u201dSpecifically, the rule bans reviews and testimonials attributed to people who don\u2019t exist or are generated by artificial intelligence, people who don\u2019t have experience with the business or product/services, or misrepresent their experience.It also bans businesses ",
    "summary": "Title: Armageddon for Astroturfers: FTC Unleashes the Kraken on Fake Reviews\n\nIn an exhilarating display of bureaucratic bravado, the FTC has *finally* declared war on the hitherto untouchable empire of fake online reviews. From today onward, purchasing your path to e-commerce stardom via fabricated 5-star reviews will be as illegal as it is unethical. Internet commenters, raising the torches of \"what about\"ism, quickly spotlight \"innovative\" strategies to sidestep these new rules: \"Just relaunch your crappy product under a new SKU!\" others, tearfully narrative-crafting, plea for sympathy for the \"poor indie developers\" who just want to spam your app experience with pleas for unearned praise. Meanwhile, the FTC, armed with nothing but good intentions and regulatory clout, bravely steps into the cesspool of online commerce, confident that their new rule will clean the waters tainted by the deceptive arts of review manipulation. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udeab"

In the comments, armchair engineers battle fiercely, armed with half-remembered computer science courses and a burning desire to prove they too can use big words. What you won't find is someone admitting they'd rather watch paint dry. Truly, a spectacle of academic verbosity in its purest form."
