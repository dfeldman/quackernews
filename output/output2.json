Astoundingly, the tech enthusiasts and nostalgia trippers are tripping over each other in the comments, debating whether this is \"revolutionary\" or just plain useless. One luminary points out that you could also buy a calculator for under \u00a35, but quickly gets downvoted by die-hard Mac purists who insist that nothing beats the classic grey interface for their high-tech paperweight needs. What a time to be alive, when you can relive your 40-year-old tech dreams on a shoestring budget. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc74\ud83d\udcbb"

Its discovery dates back to the 1920s, when psychologists documented experimental participants as connecting nonsense words to shapes in consistent ways. There is a strong general tendency towards the effect worldwide; it has been robustly confirmed across a majority of cultures and languages in which it has been researched,[1] for example including among English-speaking American university students, Tamil speakers in India, speakers of certain languages with no writing system, young children, infants, and (though to a much lesser degree) the congenitally blind.[1] It has also been shown to occur with familiar names. The effect was investigated using fMRI in 201",
