And how does this smoothness compare to the surface of the Earth?  The highest point on earth is Mount Everest, which is about 29,000 feet above sea level; and the lowest point (in the earth\u2019s crust) is Mariana\u2019s Trench, which is about 36,000 feet below sea level.  The larger number (36,000 feet) corresponds to about 1700 parts per million (0.17%) as compared to the average radius of the Earth (about 4000 miles).  The largest peak or trench for all of the balls I tested was about 3 \nmicrons (for the Elephant Practice Ball).  This corresponds to about 100 parts per million (0.01%) as compared to the radius of a pool ball (1 1/8 inch).  Therefore, it would appear that a pool ball (even the worst \none tested) is much smoother than the Earth would be if it were shrunk down to the size of a pool ball.  However, the Earth is actually much smoother than the numbers imply over most of its surface.  A 1x1 \nmillimeter area on a pool ball (the physical size of the images) corresponds to about a 140x140 mile area on the Earth.  Such a small area certainly doesn\u2019t include things like Mount Everest and Mariana\u2019s Trench in the \nsame locale.  And in many places, especially places like Louisiana, where I grew up, the Earth\u2019s surface is very flat and smooth over this area size.  Therefore, much of the Earth\u2019s surface would be much smoother than a pool ball if it were shrunk down to the same size.\n \nreply",
      "Not completely accurate, it depends on your definition of smoothness. The Earth scaled down to the size of a billiard ball would have a texture more like sandpaper, certainly not what most people would consider smooth.\n \nreply",

      "Because this book was written more than a year ago, it spends some time on Windows Slim Reader Writer Locks, SRWLocks which at that time of its writing were how Mutex and RWLock were implemented on Windows (by the author in fact IIRC).Since then, two important things happened.1. On Windows 8 and beyond Rust moved to WaitOnAddress with an API similar to the futex on several other systems.2. We found out SRWLocks have a significant (arguably fatal, but depending on your use case it may seem irrelevant) difference between how they actually work and what Microsoft's API said about them. This bug is fixed... in Microsoft's own version control, not in released Windows versions.Specifically SRWLocks may silently give you a Write Lock, even if you asked only for a Read Lock, in the case where the lock was just released at the moment you asked. If you were expecting other threads to also get a read lock, which would ordinarily be possible - too bad, you've secretly been given the exclusive write lock so read locks are unavailable until you release it.The actual reason seems to be this: SRWLocks are small (a single pointer, with some low bits stolen to hide metadata) and the authors forgot that they actually know (because it's a different function call) whether you asked for a read or a write lock. Since they didn't have anywhere to store this single bit (read or write) they just assumed they don't know in this edge case where the lock happens to be available immediately, and since they \"don't know\" they always give you a write lock anyway. Oops.\n \nreply",
      "I've looked in the Rust issue tracker for SRWLocks but could only find older posts. Can you share some links?\n \nreply",
      "> Specifically SRWLocks may silently give you a Write Lock, even if you asked only for a Read Lock, in the case where the lock was just released at the moment you asked.Oh hey, I reported that bug and behavior! One of my proudest reports. Not too often you find a legit bug, or at least documentation oversight, in such a core API.\n \nreply",
      "Even if you are not into Rust, I'd recommend this book if you want to get into low-level and/or embedded programming. It's an exceptionally well written introduction into the most important topics there and ~80% of the book are not specific to Rust (or can be transferred just as well to other languages).\n \nreply",
      "I wrote this in a review I believe, but this is one of the most comprehensive introductions to a good 80% of what could be considered a high performance computing education. It's extremely well written, in the weeds, but not lost in them. If you've done heavy atomics and or locks in C or C++ or with Fortran libraries, this will help show you how rust prevents so many footguns at compile time.\n \nreply",
      "Any thoughts on the best way to express global locks in Rust?A classic example is a set of bank accounts, atomically transacting with each other. Fine-grained per-account locking is possible, but risks deadlock due to lock ordering inversion. A simple solution is to replace per-account locks with a singleton global lock, covering all accounts. Any transaction must first acquire this lock, and now deadlock is impossible.But this is an awkward fit for Rust, whose locks want to own the data they protect. What's the best way to express a global lock, enforcing that certain data may only be accessed while the global lock is held?\n \nreply",
      "I don't think this is an awkward fit. There's no reason it should be Mutex<CustomerBankAccount> it can be Mutex<MyTransferToken> or indeed Mutex<()> if you're really sure you don't actually want to lock any data.One piece of advice I'd suggest is, write APIs which take that MyTransferToken to signify that you must take the lock before calling them, it can be a unit type (a Zero Size type, a struct with no members) at the start if you like, but I suspect you'll find that across several functions which take that MyTransferToken you realise actually the data I was going to put in a separate parameter is really always accompanying that token, and so it might as well go inside the the MyTransferToken and before you know it your unit type that was just to ensure correct locking is in fact an object with important data protected by the lock.\n \nreply",
      "Maybe define a new type in a such way that only 1 value of that type can be instantiated, and then put that unique value in a mutex. Any function that needs to hold the global lock accepts a value of the new type. Calling the function involves providing the value, which is proof that you are holding the mutex.\n \nreply",
      "If I\u2019m understanding correctly can\u2019t you lock on some other account criteria, like IDs? A Mutex does have to own the data but you can still decide what it owns.When you lock, the returned MutexGuard is owned, so you can pass it around or return it and it\u2019s only dropped when it ultimately goes out of scope.\n \nreply",
      "Use ghost_cell/qcell, and put the QCellOwner in a mutex. Acquiring the cell owner grants the ability to access the data, but doesn't tie ownership.\n \nreply"

      "I'm honestly surprised this has led to charges. I eagerly await the qualified immunity argument against this.Before we get too excited, there's lots of ways this can go wrong. People don't understand just how rigged the justice system is not to prosecute authority figures including the police. For example:1. Manu jurisdictions require felony charges to first be approved by a grand jury. This is meant to protect citizens from spurious felony charges. The grand jury proces empanels a group of people, just like a jury, but they'll only hear evidence that the prosecutor presents. There is no defense counsel. The defendant is not present. Anyone interesting in pursuing a prosecution is not present.So what can go wrong? A prosecutor can intentionally bring a weak case and then hang their hat on the grand jury denying to pursue charges. It happens all the time.Why would a prosecutor do this? Because they rely on the police for prosecutions. If a prosecutor gets a reputation for locking up the police then their police witnesses start getting sick and missing court dates. And that prosecutor's conviction rate goes down, which ultimately is the only thing they care about.2. Judges often either have a prosecution bias or they outright work for the benefit of the prosecution. There can be multiple reasons for this. Many judges are former prosecutors. Depending on your state, judges may be politicians effectively as they have to campaign for their position or their name is on the ballot to extend their term so narratives like \"tough on crime\" start appearing.There are three big recent examples of this:1. The YSL trial in Georgia. The judge had ex-parte meetings with witnesses and the prosecution with no defense cousel present during which a witness was coerced to testify for the prosecution by the judge. That judge was ultimately forced to recuse themselves because thsi was such an egregious breach of the rules;2. The Karen Reed trial in Massachussetts. This wasn't on the news much but was covered heavily on social media, particularly Tiktok. The list of sins by the prosecutors and judges are really too great to enumerate.3. Alec Baldwin's trial for the death of a crew member on the set of Rust. The prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense. They hid bullets in a file of another case so the defense would never see it. This led to the case being dismissed with prejudice, rightly so. This is what's called a Brady violation [1]. Now because that was a high-profile case that happened. But sometimes the Brady violation is ignored. In a famous Supreme Court case (Connick v. Thomson [2]), the Supreme Court ruled that if just one prosecutor in an office does a Brady violation then it's fine. It's not a systemic problem. Crazy.Now we have had high profile cases where the police have been successfuly prosecuted, most notably Derek Chauvin. But those really are the exception. We're a long way from a conviction.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_disclosure[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connick_v._Thompson\n \nreply"

Scott's brother, a biology student, hypothesizes that early humans could have run down big game without weapons by relying on their endurance rather than speed.In the 1980s, they go to Wyoming to test this theory by attempting to chase down antelope in the desert. The idea is to exhaust the antelope by making them run in the heat for a long period. Despite their efforts, the antelope consistently outmaneuver and outrun them, blending into herds and splitting into different directions, making it impossible to follow just one.Scott reflects on the challenges of the endeavor, the limitations of modern life, and the connection to a primitive way of living. Despite failing to catch an antelope, the story highlights the persistence of the human spirit and the desire to understand our ancient origins.\n \nreply",

      "> Get those linguists out of here, more data will replace whatever insights they have! It\u2019s a fun and increasingly popular stance to take. And, to a degree, I agree with it. More data will replace domain experts, the bitter lesson is as true in biology as it is in every other field.I think it\u2019s fundamentally shifting how people approach R&D in all physical fields. The power of \u201cthe ML way\u201d is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once you see ML upend the standard approach in one area, the question is not if but when it will upend your area, and the natural next step is to ask, \u201chow can I massively increase data collection rates so I can feed ML\u201d? It just completely flips all branches of science on their head, from carefully investigating and building first-principles theory, to saying \u201cscrew it, I really just wanted to map this design space so I can accurately predict outcomes, why don\u2019t I just build a machine to do that?\u201dIt then becomes a question of how easy it actually is to build an ML-feeding machine (not easy, very problem-specific), ergo the pendulum now swings to physical lab automation.\n \nreply",
      "> people unacquainted with biology have a false perception of how low-throughput biology experimentation is. In many ways, it can be. But the underlying physics of microbiology lends itself very well to experiments that could allow one to collect tens-of-thousands, if not millions, of measurements in a singular experiment. It just needs to be cleverly set up.I think this passage gets to the fundamental rift of disagreement in perspective between those focused purely on computational advances versus innovating in wet lab techniques.Why? Because years of peoples' careers have been wasted waiting on promises from molecular biologists claiming they will make these \"clever\" high-throughput experiments work. In my experience, they'll spend months to years concocting a Rube Goldberg machine of chained molecular biology steps, each of which has (at best) a 90% success rate. You don't have to chain many of these together before your \"clever\" setup has a ~0% probability of successfully gathering data.\n \nreply",

      "In biology, the most important step is finding the right thing to measure. Biological systems are highly contextual, so the second most important step is finding the second thing to measure in relationship to the first thing.In the case of AlphaFold, measuring crystal structures is the most important thing (molecular phenotype). The second most important thing is measuring many genomes. Multiple sequence alignments allows evolution (variation under selection) to tell you about the important bits of the structure. The distance from aligned DNA sequences to protein structure isn't a bridge too far.Unfortunately, biology has been mislead by the popularity of transcriptomics, which the post touches on briefly (limits of single-cell approaches). Transcriptomics generates lots of data (relatively) cheaply, but isn't really the right thing to measure most of the time because it is too far removed causally from the organismal phenotype, the thing we generally care about in biomedicine. Although gene expression has provided some insights, we've exhausted most of its value by now and I doubt ML will rescue it (speaking from personal experience).\n \nreply"

      "This seems like a tough build vs buy sell.  For a lot (most?) companies, the search/recommendation system isn't necessarily optimized for the customer's search.  Instead, it's a way to maximize revenue via preferred placement or inject ads.  This almost always leads to a gigantic if/else chain of bespoke business analyst driven decisions for the marketplace.How are you going to allow folks to influence the system?  Or do you see your system integrated behind their pseudo-recommendation engine?\n \nreply",
      "The build vs buy decision does come up, but like you mentioned, the product direction of Shaped is to be primitives for search and recommendation, allowing users that want to build use Shaped to empower them to build quicker (e.g. integrated behind their psudo-recommendation engine). In truth we have multiple abstractions to Shaped allowing more technical teams to integrate like this, or less technical ones to have more of an end-to-end integration experience.The other related market trend we think about here: recommendation is going through a similar journey to what search did 10 years ago. Search at some point was more build leaning, but over time the technology became democratized and then companies like Elastic and Algolia had offerings that pushed search to lean towards buy. We're seeing recommendations going through the same revolution now that the technologies and system design (e.g. 4 stage recommenders) are more solidified. It's the data that makes these systems unique between companies not the infrastructure or algorithms.\n \nreply",

      "How do you personalize to the specific signals of the product, do they ingest into your infrastructure? What happens if a customer discovers a bug in a feature they're ingesting, how do they have control of retrains/pinning model versions? Who handles monitoring, the customer or your service?\n \nreply",
      "Yes when integrating Shaped you connect up the data sources needed to ingest: interactions, items and users. The Shaped interface then allows you to select which exact fields should be used for creating a Shaped model. We provide a full SQL interface to do this, which gives a lot of flexibility.Our dashboard provides monitoring to help understand what data is ingested and view data quality over time. We expect customers to monitor this but also have alerts on our side and jump in to help customers if we see anything unexpected.The dashboard also shows training metrics over time (how well does the model predict the test set after each retrain?) and online attribution metrics (how well does the model optimize the chosen objective?).Customers can disable retraining if they want (which is essentially pinning the model version to current), we can do model version rollbacks on our side if we see an issue or if requested but it's not a self-serve feature yet. Because we've made it easy to create or fork a Shaped model, we've seen customers often create several models as fall-backs that rely on more static data sources or are checkpoints of a good state.\n \nreply",
      "How do you measure quality? And, can users game that quality?I think that's the hardest thing on any recommendation or search system. It's really hard to do without using money as a neutral measure of value. And, without a good measure of quality - it's unclear that the system is optimizing the right metrics (without cannibalizing others).\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for the first question!We run online A/B tests to objectively measure quality against our ranking algorithms and other baselines. As you mentioned it's crucial that the measure of quality for these tests chosen is fair and correlates with the topline business objective. E.g. if you just evaluate clicks then the system will show click-baity content and overall perform worse.To handle this, we make it really easy to define different objectives and experiment with how it changes results. So although we don't claim to solve the issue directly, we believe that if users can quickly experiment with different proxy objectives, that'll be able to find the one that correlates with their topline objective quicker.\n \nreply"

Or, more accurately: I can\u2019t think of a way to do it.[1]Oh, this is a case for WeakMaps right?    const MemoCache = new WeakMap();\n    function memoize(f, x) {\n        const cache = MemoCache.get(f) || new Map()\n        MemoCache.set(f, cache)\n        if (!cache.has(x)) {\n            cache.set(x, f(x))\n        }\n        return cache.get(x);\n    }\n\nOh wait:> 1. You could create a global memoization map keyed on the function that you\u2019re calling, but this would actually have different semantics than I\u2019m imagining. If I said `memoize(f, 1) + memoize(f, 1)` I would expect those to each invoke `f`, because instances of `memoize` shouldn\u2019t share results. Why not? Because this is a fake example, and a global memoization is a different (easier!) thing than per-call-site memoization.Like I get what you're saying but you could just cache the call site too?    const MemoCache2 = new WeakMap();\n    function memoize2(f, x) {\n        const callsite = new Error().stack\n        const macro_cache = MemoCache2.get(f) || {};\n        const micro_cache = macro_cache[callsite] || new Map();\n        macro_cache[callsite] = micro_cache;\n        MemoCache2.set(f, macro_cache)\n\n        if (!micro_cache.has(x)) {\n            micro_cache.set(x, f(x))\n        }\n        return micro_cache.get(x);\n    }\n\nI admit that this is something of a trickery though, but I mean, it's trickery specifically to work around that this person doesn't want to write `const my_f1 = memoize(f), my_f2 = memoize(f)` in some location on the screen. Precisely because people who write JavaScript are not accustomed to macros, they are not expecting `memoize(f, 1) + memoize(f, 1)` to be a proper memoization expression, they aren't expecting weird stuff with weakmaps and inspecting stack traces to identify call sites and all that.\n \nreply",
      "Wait, can't you just set the property on the function object itself to accomplish this?\n \nreply",
      "I'm intrigued on why you would want those two calls to memoize separately?  I'm sure there are reasons it could be needed, such that I'm not trying to argue against it.  Genuinely curious to see a situation it would be desired.\n \nreply",
      "You point out a good general problem that I find when blogging -- like, you don't want this, right? The whole premise is absurd; the point is not to memoize an expression, but rather to demonstrate that you can share values between compile-time and runtime. But in order to do this you need some specific example of the idea so that readers have something concrete to hold onto and generalize from. And then the difficulty is trying to present that specific example in a way that gets the general idea across, right, without the reader overfitting to the specific example you presented. It's hard! I don't think this one really succeeded.\n \nreply",
      "I call that the curse of examples.  Often conflated with \"being in the weeds.\"  Is frustrating, as people will jump on you with the X-Y problem style discussions.  Which, fair that that is sometimes apt.  Probably more often than makes sense, honestly.Still, I did the callout that I did not mean that as an argument on if they really wanted it because I think it is fair to explore the intent as stated.

      "The Supreme Court made the right decision.Unlike the hyperbolic coverage in the press - the decision did not say that judges are now responsible for making regulation, rather than experts in regulatory agencies.What they said is that now, if a statute is ambiguous, a regulatory agency makes a regulation that falls within that ambiguity, and someone files a lawsuit, the courts can play their standard, established role in resolving the ambiguity and figuring out the intent of Congress and determining whether the regulation is authorized by statute.Previously, Chevron deference required the courts to defer to the agency's interpretation of the statute, regardless of how \nunreasonable that interpretation was.This was abused by people who used it as a loophole to push through regulation which they knew would not be politically viable in Congress. Chevon deference allowed an end-run around democracy. And also led to uncertainty - because these regulations were politically controversial and not supported by law, just by executive branch fiat, they are prone to being revoked whenever the party holding the presidency changes.If a topic is important enough, Congress can always resolve any of these issues by amending the relevant statute.All of these controversies over Supreme Court decisions really come down to people who are advocating for positions and regulations which are unachievable through the normal political, legislative process in the US getting upset that the Supreme Court is not allowing them to enact these policies through backdoors and loopholes rather than the democratic process.\n \nreply",
      "The ruling itself ironically provides an example of why it is a bad ruling: Gorsuch, authoring the majority opinion, repeatedly referred to \"nitrous oxide\" rather than nitrogen oxides. If the SCOTUS justices can't get this right, in the opinion itself, how can we expect them to make informed decisions on other scientific matters that are more complex?It also seems legally dubious to me, because there will always logically be some level at which interpretive discretion is allowed in executing some statute. Laws cannot fundamentally anticipate every single scenario to which they might be applied. It's disingenuous or naive to believe that regulation is any different at some fundamental level from any other form of statute.You can also turn your own argument on its head: if someone has a problem with a regulatory interpretation, they can always appeal it. SCOTUS could have ruled something more reasonable along these lines, to clarify how to establish abuse of regulation.I tend to be deregulatory in my political sympathies in a lot of domains, but this is not how to go about the issue, in my opinion.\n \nreply",

Previously, if your company was involved in something that would fall under the governance of a governmental agency, like dumping some new chemical into a body of water, the EPA could be brought in to make a ruling on the matter.Now, that ruling might not be in the best interest of that company depending on the level of regulatory capture.In our current world, that organization will now file a lawsuit to block the ruling of the govt organization and cite the removal of Chevron deference.
