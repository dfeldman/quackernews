Users seeking facts now find themselves armed with impeccably cited satire, because who needs accuracy when you\u2019ve got comedic gold? In the comments, the digital peanut gallery toggles between existential dread and championing this as the innovation of the century, seemingly unaware that their \"informed debates\" are based on articles like \"Supreme Court Rules Supreme Court Rules.\" Surely, the rise of our robot overlords can't come soon enough."
