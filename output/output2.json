      "The new HSTX interface on the RP2350 seems to be squarely targeted at this use case (video output) and doesn't require the use of PIO or consuming a ton of CPU cycles. There's a nice write up on the capability here: https://www.cnx-software.com/2024/08/15/raspberry-pi-rp2350-...\n \nreply",
      "The main advantage of the SIO TMDS encoder, is that it allows you to output TMDS on any GPIO, instead of the eight that the HSTX is restricted to.And they allow an easy upgrade path for projects that were already bit-banging DVI on the rp2040. Other than those two advantages, I don't think there is any advantage to the SIO TMDS encoder over the HSTX TMDS encoder.I get the impression that the SIO TMDS encoder was added to the design first, and there wasn't a good reason to remove them after the introduction of HSTX.\n \nreply",
      "Isn't hstx mainly good for streaming out? My naive guess would be that it wouldn't have as much transceiver offload capabilities, like what the SIO I naively guess would be good for.The nice part about using SIO seems to be that you can do the tdms encoding there. With hstx you need the output bitstream in the right format already which seems like you might be back to needing the CPU to do the encoding.\n \nreply",
      "This is amazing, not only did they port from the 2040 to the 2350, but they also ported all the functionality they could support over to the RV32 cores as well. PicoDVI is usable no matter what cores one chooses to use on the RP2350. Well done!\n \nreply",

      "Jetbrains have a really solid testing team.Lots of places have a two tier system where the real developers write the code and those who don't make the cut test the code, with pay delta and an aspiration of being promoted out of testing.Other places have a mandatory stint in testing for new developments as a way to get some headcount on the task.Jetbrains don't do that. Or at least they didn't sometime before covid when I met a bunch of their test devs at a conference. The developers mostly doing testing were equals to those mostly doing product work. Possibly with a more extreme bias towards case analysis.I don't think it's a coincidence that jetbrains treat their test team as peers to the others and that their software seems to mostly not fall over in the field.\n \nreply",
      "I feel like developers who don't write tests while writing their production code aren't doing a real job in 2024. Sure you might have a QA team or something, but that should be a vast minority of the tests being written. Test driven development and Agile and all that had some people upset and whiny 20 years ago, but if I see code without tests, I assume it's broken. The only way anyone knows anything works both now AND when the next 10, 100, 1000 commits roll in, your manually-tested edge cases have long been forgotten and I doubt you even got it right at all. Let's keep normalizing writing tests and thinking, up front, how to ensure our code works.

      "Most tests I encounter in the real world are terrible, fundamentally broken, and a waste of build times. I have almost never had a potential bug caught by a test written by others. I have been a software developer for 25 years across multiple languages and ecosystems.Everyone jumped on the testing bandwagon but writing code that is testable is a learned skill that nobody bothers to learn. Instead we end up with overly-mocked tests that\u2014in practice\u2014test that \u201cthe code is written like it currently is\u201d rather than that it actually behaves correctly.These kinds of tests actually provide negative value. Besides taking up time during every PR and build, they fire off on any attempt to clean up or refactor. Every time you edit the code you have to edit the tests which entirely defeats the point.The solution ends up being, unsurprisingly, lessons learned from the functional world: don\u2019t access or manipulate external state, operate only on direct inputs and only manipulate your outputs. As a result code ends up being dumb, short, and obvious. But nobody learns to write code this way, so two hundred line spaghetti functions are the norm.\n \nreply",

And this is great! Further advances come from doing just this. But for pedagogical purposes, stuff sticks in the human brain so much better if we teach the journey, and not just the destination.

It gave them a story to follow, a reason to learn this stuff.Be careful.In undergrad, I worked as a math tutor at their tutoring institute. We had two calculus classes - one for engineers/science and the other for business/economics.If you're into Newtonian stuff or it's relevant to your degree, then your approach is all great. What I consistently saw is people in degrees like biology (or even industrial engineering) had a harder time learning because of those physics applications in the book. They came in with one problem: Having trouble with the calculus. And then they discovered they had two problems: To understand calculus they suddenly had to understand physics as well.You'd get students who were totally adept at differentiating and integrating, but would struggle with the problems that involved physics. Yes, it is important to be able to translate real world problems to math ones, but it's a bigger problem when you don't care about that particular field.Same problem with the business students. Since all the tutors were engineering folks, they had trouble tutoring the business students because their textbook was full of examples that required basic finance knowledge (and it really doesn't help that financial quantities are discrete and not continuous, adding to the tutors' confusion).If you can find an application the student is interested in, then by all means, use that approach.

The author talks about \u201ctime zones\u201d but the library only deals  with time zone offsets.

Why make your users navigate a nebulous conversation tree to fulfill a programmable task?Personally when I realize I can only talk to a bot, I lose interest and end the call. If I wanted to do something routine, I wouldn't have called.\n \nreply",

      "Some people (like me) are primarily verbal processors:- I am dictating this message through macOS's voice to text right now- I am a huge user of Google Assistant- I prefer to call people versus texting them- I tend to call restaurants instead of using something like Toast to order takeout (although this is partially because online services will add a surcharge onto the price sometimes, and sometimes I need to ask questions about dietary restrictions, etc.)Generally, wherever possible, I will use a voice interface versus a text based one to get my point across. It's just faster and more convenient for me.

I think I understand what my workflow inside it would be like based on your text and images.I'm most excited to see well-done concepts in this space, though, as I hope it means we're fast-forwarding past this era to one in which we use AI to do new things for people and not just do old things more cheaply.

      "This was really nice.I'll just say, it starts out deconstructing the way \"magic\" in the modern world has given way to \"engineering\" and thus mythological things like 'deals with the devil' are no longer believed.But, in my view, a significant part of the appeal of the 'deal with the devil' is that it isn't mysterious. A Faustian bargain works according to exactly the letter of the deal, and the devil always keeps his end of it. Part of what makes it interesting, enticing even, is that it looks like there might be ways to outwit the devil. The devil then is a force of nature to be engineered just like any other branch of engineering in modern times, not an arbitrary fact of life beyond our comprehension.\n \nreply",
      "Faust himself didn't get tricked. He was offered the chance to get out of it until the very last instant. There wasn't any sneaky wording. There wasn't anything to outwit.At the beginning he somehow convinced himself that his soul didn't really exist, despite the presence of a literal devil in front of him, offering the power to do genuine magic. At the end he somehow just couldn't bring himself to repent.In between he uses his power for absolutely nothing of interest. The most earth shaking thing he does is that he plays a prank on the Pope.I'll be honest that I really don't get the point of the story. It's not about the devil being a trickster. If anything it reads kinda like a self critique by Marlowe, but that reading is also kinda shaky. It's more like people just wanted to see an academic get taken down a peg.\n \nreply",
      "Even if the Devil was being honest with the terms, Faust did get tricked so long as he did not believe in souls, even if it was Faust tricking himself, and presumably the Devil was counting on that, knowing as he did that it was a bad deal.That's not unbelievable. It's human nature. I think a lot of real life businesses that work more or less the same way. It's a tragic tale about a pretty regular guy convincing himself to accept a shitty deal because the short term upside sounds pretty great, despite not even particular wanting or needing that upside.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, the point, as I have always thought, is not that playing with the devil is playing with a deceitful sharper, but playing against one's own inability to handle one's desires, one's own imperfections and basically facing the corruption of the original sin in oneself. The devil just sets things up in such a way that the human who yielded to the temptation arrives to the state of ruin faster, and initially enjoying the ride, all while  not being formally lied to at any moment.The idea is that there logically may be ways to outwit the devil, but he will never offer you a deal where you would be able to outwit him by the power of your (weak and corrupted) mind, so the faith is the only salvation, and rejecting any deals is the only non-losing strategy. Remember, Dr Faustus was not written by an atheist.\n \nreply",

      "Your assumption that operations managers will be swiftly replacing their human charges with AI agents indicates that you haven't spent enough time understanding the businesses of your customers. You really need to take a job in one of these roles for several months and spend more time talking to the people whose jobs you intend to automate away with this product, otherwise you're not going to reach people with this.Tech people seem to have this cluster of assumptions that leads them to conclude that there aren't intelligent people in non-tech roles, and that these people can't see obvious optimizations of their roles because of their lack of coding skills or something.The reality is usually that there are layers upon layers of hidden complexity in these businesses -- ones that require a mix of domain expertise and deep awareness of the business and human context to effectively manage. Often you won't even have so much as heuristics to go on.That isn't to say that automation and AI can't be leveraged to great effect, but it's simply not going to be the drop-in solution you claim it is. Claiming it is in this way -- esp with your smug lip-service to job annihilation -- is going to rub people the wrong way.Instead you should re-message this around augmentation and making jobs easier so that people can focus on other concerns, and reducing costly errors introduced by manual process.It's unclear who exactly your target is, but if you are going for e.g. parts manufacturers, local shipping & logistics companies, small CPG brands, then the examples in your videos are all wrong. Get the weird Fibonacci stuff out of the side panel, clean out any junk that says \"test\" and use polished examples related to reconciling purchase orders, forecasting demand for a new product line, managing production schedules, etc. You need to make the value this thing adds accessible to intelligent people who don't have a CS degree.\n \nreply",

      "I used to work for newspapers (as a software engineer) so I'm very familiar with this conundrum.Ultimately it's the value proposition, particularly with regional newspapers. I worked at a regional newspaper and their subscription price was more than the New York Times. Their subscriber base was basically all old, suburban white people who still got print newspapers. Print is still the cash cow of regionals to this day.They had terrible technology. Stories, of course, were always presented as... stories. They were stuck in their ways. No emphasis on, like the post mentions, creating good data products - e.g. events, restaurants, weather maps, etc.A big hurdle for newspapers is, yes, on giving away their news for free in the early days of the web - creating a certain expectation. But also their arrogance of not adapting to the times. The Charlotte Agenda was one of the only digital only profitable news publications before it got bought by Axios. They made money from a jobs board and other ideas (that I am now forgetting) that would cater to a regional audience.News people tend to think \"journalism is sacred\" to the point of myopia. Their product is outdated. I read the New York Times for national news, but regional news (which is the majority of newspapers) consistently don't appeal to me. Why would I pay to read about a carjacking in a far off neighborhood? Yes, give me important stories, but also give me visuals and data and products that would fit into the \"not video\" segment. Even feature stories just don't have much pizzaz - who really wants to read an interview - I want to watch an interview. Give me information that can't be expressed in video and that isn't 2000 words long with long, drawn out flowery language.Needless to say I don't work in news anymore.

The comment section transforms into a tragicomic arena where armchair philosophers debate the finer points of digital piracy, mistakenly comparing Dotcom to Snowden and Assange, because <em>all internet heroes wear the same-sized cape</em>, right? Meanwhile, one sage inquires if it's better to paraglide or parasail, lifting the intellectual debate to stratospheric heights. Dotcom's pending extradition has clearly left a massive void in our lives and law libraries, but fear not\u2014there's always another digital renegade ready to misappropriate the mantle of \u2018freedom fighter\u2019."

    "first_paragraph": "We\u2019re Fly.io, a new public cloud with simple, developer-friendly ergonomics. And as of today, cheaper GPUs. Try it out; you\u2019ll be deployed in just minutes.We just lowered the prices on NVIDIA L40s GPUs to $1.25 per hour. Why? Because our feet are cold and we burn processor cycles for heat. But also other reasons.Let\u2019s back up.We offer 4 different NVIDIA GPU models; in increasing order of performance, they\u2019re the A10, the L40S, the 40G PCI A100, and the 80G SXM A100.  Guess which one is most popular.We guessed wrong, and spent a lot of time working out how to maximize the amount of GPU power we could deliver to a single Fly Machine. Users surprised us. By a wide margin, the most popular GPU in our inventory is the A10.The A10 is an older generation of NVIDIA GPU with fewer, slower cores and less memory. It\u2019s the least capable GPU we offer. But that doesn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s capable enough. It\u2019s solid for random inference tasks, and handles mid-sized generative AI stuff like Mistral N",
    "summary": "Title: GPU Bargain Bin Bonanza!\n\nThe disruptive munchkins at <em>Fly.io</em> have taken a brave leap into the cutthroat world of slashing prices on obsolete tech that nobody asked for. Today, they proudly announce a fire sale on the NVIDIA L40s GPUs, now a steal at just $1.25 per hour! Spoiler alert: nobody really wanted these beastly power guzzlers until the price dropped. This fascinating pivot has left the tech world abuzz with developers - mostly those whose hobbies include complaining about AWS pricing and hoarding vintage VPS - swooping in to claim their discounted digital trophies. Meanwhile, comment sections are filled with jubilant cries of \"Take my money!\" and sarcastic quips about heating homes with excess computational heat. Just another day in paradise for tech's bargain bin shoppers. \ud83e\udd11\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udd25"
