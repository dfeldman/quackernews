    "summary": "On the pressing global agenda today, tokyoweekender.com brings us an earth-shattering scoop about Japan's Cat Island facing extinction (shocking, right?). The article juggles expertly between an ecological distraught and a feline photoshoot, managing to inform us how both cats and humans can't resist a good sea breeze. Meanwhile, the comments section transforms into a battlefield where readers meander from climate change experts to cat behavior specialists, pondering crucial issues like whether the cats prefer sushi or canned tuna. Truly, if journalism ever fails, a soap opera in making stands ready."

      "There was an article posted on here[1] a while back that I only just found again, introducing the term \"expedience.\" The idea was that we think we live in a world where people have to have \"the best\" sweater, be on \"the best\" social network, drive \"the best\" car, etc. But when you look at what really WINS, it's not the best, it's the most \"expedient\" - i.e. sufficiently good, with built-in social proof, inoculated of buyer's remorse, etc.Is Amazon \"the best\" place to go shopping? No, you might find better prices on individual items if you put a little more work into it, but it's the most expedient. Is Facebook/Instagram/Tiktok/insert here \"the best\" social network? No, but it is the most accessible, easy-to-use, useful one. Is a Tesla (perhaps outdated example since X) \"the best\" car - no, but it is the most expedient.There is a tangent here that intersects with refinement culture as well. Among the group of society that (subconsciously) care about these \"expedient\" choices, you see everyone and everything start to look the same[1]https://tinaja.computer/2017/10/13/expedience.html\n \nreply",
      "\"Expedient\" is a common (or at least not rare) English word that means something like \"practical and effective even if not directly attending to higher or deeper considerations.\"For example, if two students in a class are having frequent confrontations that bring learning in the class to a halt, and attempts by teachers and counselors to address their conflict directly haven't been effective, the expedient solution might be to place them in separate classes. The \"right thing\" would be to address the problem on the social and emotional level, but if continued efforts to do so is likely to result in continued disruption to the students' education, it might be better to separate them. \"Expedient\" acknowledges the trade-off, while emphasizing the positive outcome.Often a course of action is described as \"expedient\" when it seems to dodge an issue of morality or virtue. For example, if we solve climate change with geoengineering instead of by addressing thoughtless consumerism, corporate impunity, and lack of international accountability, many people would feel frustrated or let down by the solution because it would solve the problem without addressing the moral shortcomings that led to the problem. The word expedient stresses the positive side of this, the effectiveness and practicality of the solution, while acknowledging that it leaves other, perhaps deeper issues unaddressed.\n \nreply",

      "This is one reason I believe \"right to repair\" laws are so important. The environmental damage of producing the device is already done. Make it last as long as possible. Reduce, reuse... then recycle.Re-using devices helps us also reduce the number of new devices needed... which is what probably scares the corporate oligarchy. If we're not buying new phones every couple of years how will the stock prices keep going up?Never the less, the devices we make these days can last a long, long time. I've been repairing and maintaining iPhone 5's, 7's, and 8's that are no where near their end of life. The iPhone has a couple of small electrolytic capacitors which should have a useful life of at least 20 years. And can be replaced! The batteries and screens can replaced. These devices can last much longer than we give them credit for.But tech companies have been struggling to make it illegal or difficult to repair for a long time. I've been seeing photojournalist projects such as this since the late 90s at least (longer perhaps). In North America we had a culture that valued repairing and building things that lasted.

      "I feel like this article is really overselling this filter. A 4-point symmetric interpolation kernel can be parameterized as [k, 1-k, 1-k, k]/2, i.e. it has a single degree of freedom. k=-1/4 is bicubic, k=1/4 is this 'magic', and k=0 is bilinear. Bicubic is sharper, and 'magic' has better alias rejection. Which looks better depends on the image and the viewer's subjective preference. For insta photos, it's probably better to go for 'magic', while for text, one might prefer bicubic. Neither is \"simpler\" as this article keeps suggesting, they just have different filter coefficients, that's all. But any other value of k is an equally valid choice.\n \nreply",
      "It certainly is. Especially lacking in proper comparisons of the final filter with the competition. I myself default to RobidouxSharp for downscaling and something like https://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?t... for upscaling.\n \nreply",
      "Took the time to make such a comparison using the article's sample images (even if the filter isn't sharpened in those), same thrice doubling of the small picture: http://0x0.st/XEEZ.pngI find such a test strange and irrelevant, though.\n \nreply",
      "Ooh the animated comparison is really helpful. I couldn\u2019t see it in the article, but with your version the Magic version feels flatter, almost like it\u2019s a bokeh blur and not just a low pass. The Sigmoid seems far better than either Magic or Bicubic.\n \nreply",
      "The page mostly talks about image resampling where the goal is more or less preserving all frequencies, but it's also extremely effective at implementing Gaussian blur. Basically, you do n iterations of sampling by 1/2 using this kernel, followed by a very small FIR filter, then n iterations of upsampling 2x using the same kernel. Here, n is essentially log2 of the blur radius, and the total amount of computation is essentially invariant to that radius. All these computations are efficient on GPU - in particular, the upsampling can be done using vanilla bilinear texture sampling (which is very cheap), just being slightly clever about the fractional coordinates.It works well because, as stated, the kernel does a good job rejecting frequencies prone to aliasing. So, in particular, you don't get any real quality loss from doing 2x scale changes as opposed to bigger steps (and thus considerably larger FIR support).I have some Python notebooks with some of these results, haven't gotten around to publishing them yet.\n \nreply",

[...] This remarkable property can help prevent \u201cbeat\u201d artifacts across a resized image.So, basically the reason why this works better than other visually similar filters is that it happens to satify the Nyquist ISI criterion[1].[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_ISI_criterion\n \nreply",

This is one of the many things that seem likely to have been nerfed over time, I'd guess partly because human preference training just asks for bland responses, and partly because the injected prompts from OpenAI strongly discourage doing things related to real people, and those preferences are carried through, subtlely or not, into the augmented training data most open models tune on.\n \nreply",
