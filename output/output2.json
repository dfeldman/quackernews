      "From the paper, \"Notably, for multiplying two 4 \u00d7 4 matrices, applying the algorithm of Strassen recursively results in an algorithm with 49 multiplications, which works over any field...AlphaEvolve is the first method to find an algorithm to multiply two 4 \u00d7 4 complex-valued matrices using 48 multiplications.\"If you do naive matrix multiplication, you get a sense that you're doing similar work multiple times, but it's hard to quantify just what that duplicated work entails. Compare it to, for example, calculating the size of the union of two sets:Total size = size(A) + size(B) - size(intersection(A, B))You have to take out that extra intersection amount because you've counted it twice. What if you could avoid counting it twice in the first place? That's easy, you just iterate over each set once, keeping track of the elements you've already seen.Strassen's algorithm keeps track of calculations that are needed later on. It's all reminiscent of dynamic programming.What I find interesting is that it seems the extra savings requires complex values. There must be something going on in the complex plane that is again over-counting with the naive approach.\n \nreply",
      "By googling \"4x4 matrices multiplication 48\" I ended up on this discussion on math.stackexchange https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/578342/number-of-el... , where in 2019 someone stated \"It is possible to multiply two 4\u00d74 matrix A,B with only 48 multiplications.\", with a link to a PhD thesis. This might mean that the result was already known (I still have to check the outline of the algorithm).\n \nreply",
      "As already noted in a post by fdej further down, Waksman's algorithm from 1970, which works over the complex numbers, requires only 46 multiplications (and I guess, divisions by 2, which may or may not be relevant depending on your actual ring).\n \nreply",
      "The answer says \"For rings in which division by 2 is permitted\". Is there the same constraint for AlphaEvolve's algorithm?Edit2: Z_2 has characteristics 2.Edit: AlphaEvolve claims it works over any field with characteristic 0. It appears Waksman's could be an existing work. From the AlphaEvolve paper: \"For 56 years, designing an algorithm with fewer than 49 multiplications over any field with characteristic 0 was an open problem. AlphaEvolve is the first method to find an algorithm to multiply two 4 \u00d7 4 complex-valued matrices using 48 multiplications.\"\n \nreply",

      "Not sure if this can work. We played around with something similar too for computer use, but comparing embeddings to cache validate the starting position is super gray, no clear threshold. For example, the datetime on the bottom right changes. Or if it's an app with a database etc, it can change the embeddings arbitrarily. Also, you must do this in every step, because as you said, things might break at any point. I just don't see how you can reliably validate. If anything, if models are cheap, you could use another cheaper llm call to compare screenshots, or adjust the playwright/api script on the fly. We ended up writing up a quite different approach that worked surprisingly well.There are definitely a lot of potential solutions, I'm curious where this goes. IMO an embeddings approach won't be enough. I'm more than happy to discuss what we did internally to achieve a decent rate though, the space is super promising for sure.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks for sharing your experience! I'd love to chat about what you did to make this work, if I may use it to inform the design of this system. I'm at erik [at] pig.devTo clarify, the use of CLIP embeddings in the CUA example is an implementation decision for the CUA example, not core to the engine itself.This was very intentional in the design of Check being a pair of Capture() -> T and Compare(current: T, candidate: T) -> bool. T can be any data type that can serialize to a DB, and the comparison is user-defined to operate on that generic type T.A more complete CUA example would store features like OCR'ed text, Accessibility Tree data, etc.I'll use now to call out a few outstanding questions that I don't yet have answers for:- Parameterization. Rather than caching and reusing strict coordinates, what happens when the arguments of a tool call are derived from the top level prompt, or even more challenging, as the result of a previous tool call. In the case of computer use, perhaps a very specific element x-path is needed, but that element is not \"compile time known\", rather derived mid-trajectory.- What would it look like to stack compare filters? IE, if a user wanted to first filter by cosine distance, and then later apply more strict checks on OCR contents.- As you mentioned, how can you store some knowledge of environment features where change *is* expected. Datetime in the bottom right is the perfect example of this.\n \nreply",
      "Hey, working on a personal project. Would love to dig into how you approached this.\n \nreply",
      "The tricky question is what env state do you compare in order to decide if its a cache hit or miss? just screen status, screen status + all open apps, that + all running processes etc. you know what i mean. I think its a solvable problem and very interesting one too. One now needs to think about what would a human consider while using a muscle memory and that varies based on the action i.e. \"rm -rf .\" requires knowing what directory i am in vs \"click close + don't save\" requires knowing I don't want the recent change.\n \nreply",

      "This seems like a much more powerful version of what I wanted MCP \"prompts\" to be - and I'm curious to know if I have that right.For me, I want to reduce the friction on repeatable tasks. For example, I often need to create a new GraphQL query, which also requires updating the example query collection, creating a basic new integration test, etc. If I had a MCP-accessible prompt, I hoped the agent would realize I have a set of instructions on how to handle this request when I make it.\n \nreply",
      "In a way, a Muscle Mem trajectory is just a new \"meta tool\" that combines sequential use of other tools, with parameters that flow through it all.One form factor I toyed with was the idea of a dynamically evolving list of tool specs given to a model or presented from an MCP server, but I wasn't thrilled by:- that'd still require a model in the loop to choose the tool, albeit just once for the whole trajectory vs every step- it misses the sneaky challenge of Muscle Memory systems, which is continuous cache validation. An environment can change unexpectedly mid-trajectory and a system would need to adapt, so no matter what, it needs something that looks like Muscle Mem's Check abstraction for pre/post step cache validation\n \nreply",
      "I love the minimal approach and general-use focus.If I understand correctly, the engine caches trajectories in the simplest way possible, so if you have a cached trajectory a-b-c, and you encounter c-b-d, there's no way to get a \"partial\" cache hit, right? As I'm wrapping my head around this, I'm thinking that the engine would have to be a great deal more complicated to be able to judge when it's a safe partial hit.Basically, I'm trying to imagine how applicable this approach could be to a significantly noisier environment.\n \nreply",
      "I struggled with this one for a while in the design, and didn't want to be hasty in making any decisions that lock us into a direction.I definitely want to support sub-trajectories. In fact, I believe an absolutely killer feature for this system would be decomposing a large trajectory into smaller, more repeated sub-trajectories.Jeff from trychroma.com often talks about agent engineering as being more like industrial engineering than software eng, and I'd agree.One part of the original spec I wrote for this included a component I call the \"Compactor\", which would be a background agent process to modify and compress learned skills, is similar to Letta's sleep time agents:https://docs.letta.com/guides/agents/sleep-time-agentsMy fear with this is it goes against the `No hidden nondeterminism` design value I stated in the launch blog. There's plenty of things we can throw background agents at, from the Compactor to parameterizing trajectories, but that's risky territory from an observability and debugability stance.For simplicity, I just decided treat every trajectory as distinct, even if portions of it are redundant. If a cached trajectory fails a check halfway through, the agent proceeding from there just makes its own partial trajectory. Still unclear if we call that a trajectory for the same named task, or if we annotated it as a task recovery.We can always increase cache-hit rate over time, worst case is the agent just does redundant work which is the status quo anyway.\n \nreply",

      "> Our eyes can see both just fine.This gets to a gaming rant of mine: Our natural vision can handle these things because our eyes scan sections of the scene with constant adjustment (light-level, focus) while our brain is compositing it together into what feels like a single moment.However certain effects in games (i.e. \"HDR\" and Depth of Field) instead reduce the fidelity of the experience. These features limp along only while our gaze is aimed at the exact spot the software expects. If you glance anywhere else around the scene, you instead percieve an  unrealistically wrong coloration or blur that frustratingly persists no matter how much you squint. These problems will remain until gaze-tracking support becomes standard.So ultimately these features reduce the realism of the experience.

      "I didn't get to read it in its entirety.I personally think we can view logic(s) as tools. I think in a way Bayesian/probabilistic/fuzzy logics (and extensions) are more useful or appropriate in a greater setting than binary logic. We don't really know anything to absolute certainty in real life, as there may always be interfering things getting in the way of our conclusions and our senses -- and although that's just a theoretical impediment usually (we are quite sure of many things, like say that the set of primes is unbounded), in many real life cases it's very relevant, and we're usually making fuzzy judgements about things (like, the success of a venture, whether we will enjoy one thing or another, which path to take, etc.). But it doesn't make sense to declare binary logic obsolete. Think of it as floats and ints (integers). Although we can represent integers using floating point representation, in many cases representing things as ints is much more efficient and simpler. In the same way boolean logic, perhaps the simplest practical logic, is extremely useful in many cases.Binary logic (in terms of binary expressions and binary circuits) of course is also universal, as you can represent anything in binary -- so the choice of logic, given several universal choices, comes down to application and setting (including physical realization of the circuits/logic and its match to your application).For example, analog control circuits were (overwhelmingly up to the 80s perhaps) extremely useful in factories controlling processes, and there are relatively simple physical implementations of linear controls using electronics, and even (mechanical) mechanisms. Then we got really good at building small digital circuits and their analog implementation became mostly irrelevant (but still were an important stage for industrial development). With appropriate non-linearities large analog networks are universal as well though (hence Neural Networks, which happen to be implemented using binary circuits currently, but who knows this might change :) ).So I think it may be fair to see fuzzy logics as more general and more general in some sense, but they are equivalent in other senses to any universal logic (at least as far as taking computable approximations of continuous quantities).I read a while ago about Cyc's approach to Ontologies, which I understood to be systems used to prove desired claims. There were hierarchical ontologies, in the sense that if you failed to prove some claim in a certain system, you could resort to a slower, but more powerful system (in the sense that it could decide more claims). I guess you can interpret fuzzy logics as a higher ontology in another sense -- the sense of which our knowledge is really always uncertain and precisely evaluating this uncertainty may be necessary (versus just approximating claims as True/False) -- so probabilistic logics would be higher in both the sense of less efficient and more complete.Note also how things can change and you may want/need to extend your logic indefinitely! Consider how it may be useful to go beyond a simple uncertainty of a claim, and consider for example how reliable this uncertainty itself is: e.g. it may be useful to distinguish between something you know nothing about, which you might arguably attribute probability 50% to, and something you know for sure has a probability of 50%, like a coin flip -- which in turn seems like a more powerful system to be used when it gives better results than the ones which convey less information.The view of course that you're just building increasingly sophisticated binary systems that more effectively address your tasks persists valid (and relevant as we still use binary computers), again as the fact that other logics are valid too.\n \nreply"

But instead of moving to the cloud (and Databricks), they saved 5X costs by building their own analytics platform with Iceberg, Trino and Superset. The k8s operators are enterprise quality now. On-premises S3 is good, too. You can have great hardware (servers with 128 cpus and 1 TB) and networking.\nIt's not just Trino. StarRocks and Clickhouse have enterprise grade k8s helm charts/operators. That 60bn valuation is an albtross on Databrick's neck - their pricing will have to justify it, and their core business is commoditizing.Neon filled their product gap of not having an operational (row-oriented) DB.\n \nreply",
      "Not commoditising for enterprise. My last gig wouldn\u2019t allow open source software or any company that might not be there in a decade, or which kept data anywhere but our own tenant. We\u2019d look for the \u201ccall us\u201d pricing rather than hate it, which I normally do. We added databricks and it was considered one of my top three achievements, because they don\u2019t have to think about data platforms again, just focus on using it. It\u2019s SO expensive for an enterprise to rejig for a new platform that you can\u2019t rely on (insert open source project here).I managed to add one startup and so far it\u2019s done very well, but it was an exceptional case and the global CEO wanted the functionality. But it used MongoDB and ops team didn\u2019t have any skills, so rather than learn one tiny thing for an irrelevant data store they added cash to use Atlas with all the support and RBAC etc etc. They couldn\u2019t use the default Azure firewall because they only know one firewall, so added one of those too. Also loaded with contracts. Kept hiring load down, one number to call, job done. Startups cost is $5-10k per year. Support BS about $40k. (I forget the exact numbers but it dwarfed the startup costs.)Startups are from Venus, enterprise are from Jupiter.\n \nreply",

      "Totally agree. Happy open source StarRocks user here using the k8s operator for customer-facing analytics on terabytes of data. There's very little need for Databricks in my world.\n \nreply",
      "Looking at StarRocks site (https://www.starrocks.io/), they compare against Clickhouse, Druid and Trino. Don't even compare against Spark/Databricks! Guess Spark is just not competitive.\n \nreply",
      "It's been a commodity for decades now. Metrics like price-performance have a long history, but the SnowBricks products fail at them quite dramatically. The difference is hard-sell vs. soft or no-sell.\n \nreply",
      "Not having to buy an appliance and pay for it up front is quite a valuable option. Also the split between processing and storage allows for better archival and scaling strategies.\n \nreply",
      "Anyone looking for an open-source Cloudera alternative based on Kubernetes operators. We're building one (~5 years old now): https://stackable.tech/ & https://github.com/stackabletech/On-premise open-source S3 is a problem though. MinIO is not something we're touching and other than that it looks a bit empty with enterprise ready solutions.\n \nreply"

    "summary": "In a groundbreaking display of originality, Databricks has coyly announced its acquisition of Neon, a company that dares to reimagine PostgreSQL for the adventurous souls who like their databases both serverless and seamlessly forking. Just when you thought the database wars had cooled down, Databricks leads the charge with a purchase surely motivated more by buzzwords than user needs, ensuring developers and AI agents can now sleep peacefully knowing their database foundations are as 'open' as a 24/7 diner. Commenters, absorbing wisdom from the yearly migration of database platforms, chime in with their two cents. Some preach the gospel of on-prem cost-cutting, while others betray a deep-seated fear of open-source phantoms, possibly haunted by the ghost of a failed tech support call. \ud83d\ude44"
