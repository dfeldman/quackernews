      "I think that more than physics the bottleneck for this is political (at least in the US). All of the local large projects around me are expensive because of massive amounts of red tape (environmental studies, zoning, planning), and political patronage systems. After the kick backs, political donations, promises to only work 8 hours a day, only use union labor, hire x police officers for y hours in overtime security positions a month, use xyz contractor etc. a small cost seems to be the actual labor and materials. Hell these robots if they work will be made illlegal.reply",
      "Do you have any evidence or are you just pulling this out of thin air? All sources I can find estimate pre construction costs between 3 and 10% depending on type of infrastructure and where it is (the US according to [1] is on the lower end with 3-5%). To put this in perspective the profit margins on construction projects is 7% according to [2], which also does attribute skilled labour shortages as the main factor behind increasing construction cost.[1] https://srgexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-cost-of...\n[2] https://publications.turnerandtownsend.com/international-con...reply",
      "I work for a home builder. Our single biggest problem is finding and hiring quality contractors that have enough skilled tradesmen.There are dozens of electrical contractors in my area. But only two that perform work to our standards.There is only one HVAC company that can meet our standards. Same for all of the other skilled trades.Our framing crew is the best within a 75 mile radius. Other builders are constantly trying to poach them from us. We keep throwing money at them to prevent them from going to another builder.Non skilled labor like landscaping and pest control are a dime a dozen. I just fired our main pesticide and herbicide contractor today because they couldn\u2019t get it together.Of course I had them replaced before I fired them but I had almost 20 options to choose from.Unfortunately I can\u2019t say the same about all of the skilled contractors.reply",

      "I work in commercial real estate.There are massive amounts of monopoly/duopoly interests in construction. Want to build affordable housing? Well if you are taking public dollars, you have to work with certain vendors which are approved and meet certain qualifications. Guess what, only 2 electrical vendors are approved! And so they work together and act as a racket to hold your project hostage unless you meet them on their terms.Actually had a call today with an exec with one of the largest construction general contractors and this topic of \"we can't do XYZ project [e.g. compete in that type of project type... driving costs down through competition] because we hire ABC union labor and it would screw us and our relations with the unions we work with.\"Every developer has a war story of getting burned exactly in some way by being beholden to political or labor issues.This results in higher costs... which ultimately is one of the main issues among others.reply",
      "> we hire ABC union labor and it would screw us and our relations with the unions we work with\n\nwould maybe an industry-wide union fix that issue?reply",
      "Doubtful. People get starry eyed at the idea of unions and I get why. Employees need more protection.But power patterns are the same everywhere and rather than having corrupt corporate bullshit you get corrupt union bullshit. It just might benefit you if you work in the industry and might very much be at the cost of everyone else.Police unions are the infamous example alongside the teamsters , but almost everyone who\u2019s worked with or for one has stories.I know someone who works for one and what do you know the people at the top get preferential treatment and there\u2019s all sorts of bullshit going on. It\u2019s still almost certainly better for him but it\u2019s probably not ideal for the projects.Ignoring cost overruns and hand waving things that fall under \u201clook let\u2019s just let people be people not perfect\u201d you still get a lot of problematic behavior. For example my friend is very good at his job because he was taught by someone very good and as a result has high standards for his work.This has gotten him targeted because he sets expectations too high which sure feels like a crock of shit.And that\u2019s just the work related bullshit. There\u2019s still the classics like someone higher up the chain being friends with the right people and throwing others under the bus when they shit the bed.reply",
      "I\u2019m curious if this is an example of survivorship bias though. I don\u2019t have any data, but I can easily imagine lots of projects not getting built at all due to zoning laws or the red tape cost being too high.reply",
      "Construction costs are not the only costs relating to development and redevelopment. Financing and project risk are also quite significant. Issues that push back the start of construction vastly increase financing costs, and increase construction costs. A delay in getting a permit, or a stop work order because of an environmental lawsuit runs up the interest payments on the loan used to purchase the real estate, as well as increasing the impact of inflation, delaying the revenue, and impacting trades\u2019 schedules, all of which reduce the ROI of the project. These are just some of the issues caused by delays.reply",
      "But how often do those things actually happen, and is it a substantial enough difference to actually affect the cost of building housing at a fundamental level? Remember that houses have more than tripled in cost this century in most places. A few percent is not going to substantially affect something that has increased in price 340%.reply"

      "My cynical take is that small phones don't exist because they are not the product. Similar to vape pens the product is the addictive substance the device loads. In this case its apps and ads. A smaller screen probably negatively impacts KPIs on many levels, at Google/Apple/Meta/X and on down through the ecosystem.I understand that Apple did not make enough money to make it worth their while to continue the iphone mini line. However, it does seem like there is a profitable business for someone there given how beloved it was/is.I only traded out my iphone 12 mini just recently for an iphone 16 pro (likely the last apple product I will ever buy but thats another story) and aside from the camera it is basically the same. Just heavier, awkward to hold and slightly worse designed.No major player wants a smaller screen because it has downstream impacts on the pipeline of addictive material and ad pixels they can stuff into ocular nerves.reply",

So you had 5.7 inch screens with a bezel.They were huge but I would routinely see small women pull these things out of their hand bags and press a device that obscured almost their whole face and start chatting.Things steadily got bigger from there.

From that POV, going to a phone that is twice as big is less of a barrier, as they had to keep it in a bag/purse in the first place.The return of foldables is also pretty well received in that regard.reply",

That means you can pretty tightly pack these things together without concern that they'll interact with each other.  A light electric pulse could determine if the bit is a 1 or a zero and a strong pulse would flip the bit.I'm guessing that due to this nature, these things would actually have pretty long shelf lives and near infinite read/write cycles since you are, effectively, just flipping atoms around and not actually breaking structures or dumping in charge.These should mostly work with regular silicon manufacturing.  The tricky part will be how tightly you can pack these things together before the reading structures start interfering with each other.reply",

      "I find \"engineer to manager\" guides are fundamentally not possible to write. I've been a manager of a team 3-4 times now and each experience was entirely different from the previous.But this post makes the biggest mistake, something I have struggled with in every management role: focusing on managing down.Managing down isn't actually that hard to get the hang of if you have strong technical skills and reasonable communications skills. But managing down is very similar to being a good teaching professor: absolutely worthless and largely done at your own peril.Managing up is, in practice, 100% of a manager's job. I've been on teams where this was so easy I didn't even realize it was something I had to do. Leadership liked me, I could do whatever I wanted and they were happy. I've been at places where this was an impossible task (and I saw multiple other managers/leadership hires get let go very fast if they didn't \"fit in\", despite being hired to \"shake things up\"). I've been at places where I started on the ground floor, management loved me, loved my work, my team consistently outperformed... but never in a billion years were going to allow me \"into the fold\" so to speak.I used to admire strong technical managers that had a great vision for how to solve problems, but I also have admiration for great teaching professors. In practice the best managers care primarily about politics and growing their personal stake in the organization. I've found that the more clueless they are the better (just don't point that out).reply",

This is further distilled by the cultural practice of hiring third world residents to tag training sets and provide the \"reinforcement learning\"... people who are effectively if not actually in the thrall of their employers and can't help but reflect their own sycophancy.As someone who is therefore historically familiar with this process in a wider systemic sense I need (hope for?) something in articles like this which diagnoses / mitigates the underlying process.reply",

      "Hey! We actually did a lot of research into ELO consistency, i.e. to check whether or not the NxN pairwise matrix followed the ELO model. It was a long road that's probably grounds for an entirely separate blog post, but the TLDR is that we observe that:For each document, there is a secret hidden score \"s\" which is the \"fundamental relevance according to the LLM\". Then, when we sample (q, d1, d2) from the LLM, the LLM follows the statistical property that:- The \"fundamental hidden preference\" is `pref = s_{d1} - s_{d2}`, usually ranging between -4 and 4.- The LLM will sample a normal distribution around the `pref` with stddev ~0.2, which is some \"inner noise\" that the LLM experiences before coming to a judgement.- The preference will pass through the sigmoid to get a sampled_score \\in [0, 1].- There is an additional 2% noise. i.e., 0.98 * sampled_score + 0.02 * random.random()When we use Maximum Likelihood Estimation to find the most likely predicted \"hidden scores\" \\hat{s} associated with each document, then we go ahead and sample pairwise matrices according to `0.98 * sigmoid( \\hat{s}_1 - \\hat{s}_2 + N(0, 0.02) ) + Uniform(0.02)`, then we get a pairwise matrix with virtually identical statistical properties to the observed pairwise matrices.reply",

      "would you consider JS bindings? should be easy to vibe code given what you have. bonus points if it runs in the browser (eg export the wasm binary). thank you!reply",
      "So this is for recruitment?I like the pairwise approach but in the field I'm interested in, at the document level there can be a lot of relevance (we historically use scoring based on TF-IDF) but we tend to get a corpus of documents that then need involved human analysis to give the relevant sections. It seems that paragraph-level vectors are probably at the right conceptual level for refinement.Ultimately I guess, what is considered a document is somewhat arbitrary. But I wondered if you'd looked at - or if someone here knows about - MLs for retrieval that consider documents at a mix of conceptual levels to improve retrieval. So, pairwise paragraph-level after a broader retrieval would be a simple example.I guess for looking at CV/resumes that might relate to finding someone who was gardener at Google and then later used ML for graphic design, vs someone who did ML at Google ... which might be a similar document vector (poor example, but you get the picture).Currently I'm seeing document level references to source material, snippets based on keywords, but not paragraph level referencing as you'd have for legal decisions.reply",
      "Cool stuff! We use a similar process internally to rerank and filter our cold outbound lists. We just use an off-the-shelf model as the judge, give it a custom criteria, and let it run until some set number of iterations. It's helped narrow down wide searches to the maximally relevant set of people (few thousand medium-bad matches to few hundred good matches)It's not cheap and it's not fast, but it definitely works pretty well!reply",
      "Very interesting! What are some examples of criteria that you can evaluate pairwise, but couldn't score individually?reply",
      "It's all unstructured text (title, company, company size, experience, skills, raw text, etc.) and LLMs are pretty bad at assigning numerical scores in a vacuum. To make it work, we'd have to provide a representative set of examples, break scoring down by specific field, etc.Kind of a lot of work compared to just dumping the text of 2 profiles into a context window along with a vague description of what I want, and having the LLM make the binary judgment.reply",
      "Pairwise rank constraints involve fewer assumptions that per-item scoring about the underlying nature of the data, thus they are more robust.reply",
      "Yeah that's exactly what we observed. Our goal was to create an absolute score that's completely independent from the Corpus, which is difficult because naturally all ELO distributions are inherently tied to the corpus itself!When we were exploring the mathematical foundations, we considered ELO scoring against a \"Universal Corpus\" based on the natural entropy of human language (Obviously that's intractable, but sometimes this term cancels out like in the DPO proof).But eventually we figured out a method using cross-query comparisons to assign an \"ELO bias\" to all document ELOs within a given query's candidate list. This normalizes it correctly such that when a candidate list is all bad, the ELOs shift low. And when the candidate list is all good, the ELOs shift high. Even when the relative ELOs are all the same.reply"

Our model works by iterating a recurrent block, thereby unrolling to arbitrary depth at test-time. This stands in contrast to mainstream reasoning models that scale up compute by producing more tokens. Unlike approaches based on chain-of-thought, our approach does not require any specialized training data, can work with small context windows, and can capture types of reasoning that are not easily represented in words.

Any reasoning done in latent space is therefore human-readable as a sequence of raw tokens. I'm not sure what the token sequence would look like at this point -- I assume they're full or partial (mainly English) words, connected together by the abstract N-dimensional latent space concept of the token, not connected grammatically.Something like:> prompt: add 2 + 2> reasoning: respond computation mathematics algebra scalar integer lhs 2 rhs 2 op summation> lhs 2 rhs 2 op summation gives 4> computation ops remain none result 4> response: 4Something like that; probably even less sensical.

      "> Thus, safety measures for future AI agents will likely need to employ multiple monitoring layers that hopefully have uncorrelated failure modes [...] We encourage the research community and frontier AI developers to make best use of CoT monitorability and study how it can be preserved.I am bit confused what all the 40 authors contributed to here. The paper seems to make a suggestion - monitor the chain of thought for safety. Is that the novelty part? But then, did one person come up with the idea and all 40+ people agreed to it and there put in the authors list.reply",
      "The paper isn't proposing \"monitor chain of thought for safety\" - that's already standard practice. The core finding is that training on CoT monitors destroys them. They provide empirical evidence that doing the obvious thing - training models not to have \"bad thoughts\" - causes them to learn obfuscated reward hacking instead.The paper demonstrates that current models are already performing complex reward hacks in production environments, and that attempts to fix this via CoT training make the problem worse, not better.As for your \"40 authors\" snark - this is a position paper where researchers from competing labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, government safety institutes) are jointly committing to NOT do something that's locally tempting but globally catastrophic. Getting industry consensus on \"don't train away bad thoughts even though it would make your models look safer\" is the opposite of trivial.This reads like someone who saw a medical consensus statement saying \"this common treatment kills patients\" and responded with \"did one person discover medicine exists and everyone else just agreed?\"reply",

      "I couldn't pull the link up easily, since the search terms are pretty jammed, but HN had a link to paper a couple of months back about how someone had the LLM do some basic arithmetic and report with a chain-of-thought as to how it was doing it. They then went directly into the neural net and decoded what it was actually doing in order to do the math. The two things were not the same. The chain-of-thought gave a reasonably \"elementary school\" explanation of how to do the addition, but what the model basically did in English was just intuit the answer in much the same way that we humans do not go through a process to figure out what \"4 + 7\" is... we pretty much just have neurons that just \"know\" the answer to that. (That's not exactly what happened but it's close enough for this post.)If CoT improves performance, then CoT improves performance, however the naively obvious read of \"it improves performance because it is 'thinking' the 'thoughts' it tell us it is thinking, for the reasons it gives\" is not completely accurate. It may not be completely wrong, either, but it's definitely not completely accurate. Given that I see no reason to believe it would be hard in the slightest to train models that have even more divergence between their \"actual\" thought processes and what they claim they are.reply",

It then consumes that as part of a new prompt, and generates more text. Those \"thoughts\" are obviously going to have an effect on the generated output, simply by virtue of being present in the prompt. And the evidence shows that it can help improve the quality of output. But there's no reason to expect that the generated \"thoughts\" would correlate directly or precisely with what's going on inside the model when it's producing text.reply",

Something about discussing stuff that may or may not be dice made me primed for that perhaps?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meeple#History> Over 40 games with the word meeple in the title had been published as of 2024. Several games published by large game companies, like AEG and Asmodee, have even published games with the term in the titles, as well as adopting the token design commonly associated with the term, including such games as Mutant Meeples (2012), Terror in Meeple City (2013), the Meeple Circus series (2017-2021), and Meeples and Monsters (2022). This continued until 2019, when \"MEEPLE\" was registered as an EU trademark owned by Hans im Gl\u00fcck. The 2019 trademarking was objected to by, among others, gaming company CMON. The critics argued that the term has been used in common parlance, and the very shape of the meeple became commonplace in the industry. This resulted in the EU trademark exempting the category \"toys and games\"; however, Hans im Gl\u00fcck has since registered the term as a trademark in Germany for usage which does include toys and games, and the company also acquired the EU trademark for the shape of the \u2018original\u2019 meeple figure as used in Carcassonne. In 2024, the company Cogito Ergo Meeple received a cease and desist for unsanctioned use of the trademark, and decided to change the name of their upcoming game from Meeple Inc to Tabletop Inc, and the name of the company itself to Cotswold Games.It goes on.
