The comment sections are ablaze with aerospace \"experts\" whose closest encounter with orbital mechanics is failing to install Kerbal Space Program. Despite their limited grasp on reality, they ecstatically parrot phrases like \"historic milestone\" and \u201cspace age\u201d while managing to simultaneously solve complex engineering problems from their mom's basements.
