    "first_paragraph": "RTC products use many building blocks to deliver the full experience, and one of the critical components is audio/video codecs. These codecs help compress the captured audio/video data so it can be sent across the internet efficiently to the recipient, keeping the experience real time. For example, the size of raw audio captured for a typical call is 768 kbps (mono, sampling at 48kHz, bit depth 16), which modern codecs are able to compress down to 25-30 kbps. Often this compression comes at the cost of some quality (loss of information), but good codecs can strike a balance among the trio of quality, bitrate, and complexity by exploiting deep knowledge about the nature of the audio signal as well as by using psychoacoustics.",
    "summary": "**MLow: Meta's Attempt to Re-Reinvent the Wheel**\n\nMeta, making sure no bandwidth i<i>ever</i> goes unclogged, graciously invents yet another audio codec \u2013 \"MLow\". Designed to squeeze the life out of every decibel, this codec will transform human conversation into a mesmerizing mush of almost-words, suitable for glitchy video calls and incomprehensibly futuristic raves. Commenters, wielding their vast experience from watching *at least* three YouTube videos on audio engineering, dive into heated debates over psychoacoustics, mostly confused about whether it's a real science or a term from a Star Trek episode. Meanwhile, genuine concerns about privacy issues are elegantly avoided with tactful \"But the bitrate is lower!\" deflections, proving once again that all you need to win an argument on the internet is a catchy buzzword. \ud83c\udfa7\ud83d\udc7d"
