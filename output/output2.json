      "I thought the whole point of these camera LEDs was to have them wired to/through the power to the camera, so they are always on when the camera is getting power, no matter what.Having the LED control exposed through the firmware completely defeats this.\n \nreply",
      "They are hardwired on Macbooks. From Daring Fireball, quoting an email from an Apple engineer.> All cameras after [2008] were different: The hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I believe) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There is NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed. [\u2026]> So, no, I don\u2019t believe that malware could be installed to enable the camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a situation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a very brief period of time.https://daringfireball.net/2019/02/on_covering_webcams\n \nreply",
      ">The actual firmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part and there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being flashed.That might make it harder to develop a hack, but one would hope that if the hardware team tied the LED to a hardware signal, it would not matter if the firmware were reflashed.\n \nreply",
      "I believe that it\u2019s not literally hardwired in the sense that powering up the camera also powers up the camera LED, and instead this relies on logic in the hopefully un-flashable camera+LED firmware.  Someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong.You need some logic to enforce things like a minimum LED duration that keeps the LED on for a couple seconds even if the camera is only used to capture one brief frame.I have a script that takes periodic screenshots of my face for fun and I can confirm the LED stays on even if the camera only captures one quick frame.\n \nreply",
      "A capacitor can hold enough charge to power led for noticable amount of time even if powered for a brief moment, no logic needed\n \nreply",
      "I don't think they would waste a high value capacitor just to keep a led lit for longer, also a led directly lit by a capacitor would be noticeable by slowly dimming when the capacitor discharges. It's more likely that the signal driving the led comes out of a monostable implemented in code: pin_on() drives the led on; pin_off() waits n secs then drives the led off.\n \nreply",
      "Surely a clock available to the camera firmware would be more expensive than a capacitor?",
      "The trick is to keep using the camera until that capacitor is discharged. I'm pretty sure most cameras can run at voltages below a LED's forward voltage nowadays.\n \nreply",
      "I happen to have some first-hand knowledge around the subject! In 2014 someone did a talk[0] on disabling the camera on some older Macbooks. It was fairly trivial, basically just reflashing the firmware that controlled the LED. I worked on the security team at Apple at the time and in response to this I attempted to do the same for more modern Macbooks. I won't go into the results but the decision was made to re-architect how the LED is turned on. I was the security architect for the feature.A custom PMIC for what's known as the forehead board was designed that has a voltage source that is ALWAYS on as long as the camera sensor has power at all. It also incorporates a hard (as in, tie-cells) lower limit for PWM duty cycle for the camera LED so you can't PWM an LED down to make it hard to see. (PWM is required because LED brightness is somewhat variable between runs, so they're calibrated to always have uniform brightness.)On top of this the PMIC has a counter that enforces a minimum on-time for the LED voltage regulator. I believe it was configured to force the LED to stay on for 3 seconds.This PMIC is powered from the system rail, and no system rail means no power to the main SoC/processor so it's impossible to cut the 3 seconds short by yoinking the power to the entire forehead board.tl;dr On Macbooks made after 2014, no firmware is involved whatsoever to enforce that the LED comes on when frames could be captured, and no firmware is involved in enforcing the LED stay on for 3 seconds after a single frame is captured.0: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurit...\n \nreply",

      "When I interned at IBM and this was a big deal. IBM was really invested on being \"vertically\" integrated \"from sand to software\" as they would say. One wonders what another run at this concept would be like given advances in semiconductor manufacture.I have often wondered if a chip fab that could make 1,000 chips of a given type economically (which is to say using your custom chip in your system was less expensive than adopting an off the shelf chip) would be a thing.

      "Indeed, you develop using a fab-specific PDK. But if you share a (Tower Semi, for instance) PDK, your device can have shuttle wafers with multiple designs from different companies. This is done for old nodes and low-volume or RnD parts.\n \nreply",
      "Node size and price / sq mm? The last time I looked at what it would cost to have a partial wafer it was > $25,000 (of which slightly more than half was NRE charges) but would love to find something \"hobbyist accessible.\" !\n \nreply",
      "It's not the wafer cost. The masks (the \"negatives\" for the lithography) are the problem. A mask set (you need multiple exposures for one device) for a modern EUV node costs 20-30m$. That's the limiting factor. You can't get cheaper than that.As a sibling comment notes, multi-product wafers are a theoretical answer. However, since you have process corners (manufacturing defects aren't uniformly distributed on the wafer), it is unfeasible for anything but the cheapest parts.The real next moonshot in the foundry business would be to lower the respin costs, i.e., the amount of money it costs when your fabbed first silicon doesn't yield or validate functionally in the way you had expected/planned.If I were the US government (or any other), I'd focus on that. Subsidize the respin cost to zero in the short-term, given certain prerequisites for start-ups, and push an all-out Manhatten project RnD effort to lower the respin cost in the long run.\n \nreply",

      "The author of the article reports that it is quite mysterious how the circular cheeks and the pendulum work together to compensate for differences in air pressure.  And indeed, most clockmakers and virtually all books get it wrong.  Conventional wisdom is to have a very heavy pendulum (so small vibrations won't affect it as much) and a very small swinging arc--so that the small angle approximation (sin(t) = t) holds.Harrison threw this all out.The problem being solved is that when the air pressure is low, there is less friction resistance to the swinging pendulum--and when the air pressure is high, the denser air gives more resistance to the swinging pendulum.Therefore, in denser air, the pendulums swinging arc will be fewer degrees.  For true simple harmonic motion, changing the swing arc wouldn't change the period of the pendulum  Unfortunately, pendulums don't exactly swing as simple harmonic oscillators--and for clocks as accurate as Harrison's, this makes a difference.So Harrison paid attention to the aerodynamic properties of his pendulum.  He made it lighter than usual, so that its movement would be more sensitive to barometric pressure differences, and he gave it a very wide swinging arc, so that there was more room for the circular cheeks at the top of the pendulum to correct for the differences.  And instead of making it slice as smoothly as possible through the air, he deliberately shaped it to have more drag, so it could \"sense\" the air pressure more accurately.The length this guy went to for precision was incredible.  And the craftsmanship!  He could make clocks out of wood which can (and have) been keeping very accurate time for centuries.\n \nreply",

      "> Because Bluesky\u2019s core userbase is made up of those who are fed up with the weaponized anger of Twitter...There's no weaponized anger on Twitter. Twitter defends free speech. But you can't silence those who have views opposing your own echo chamber on X / Twitter anymore.Those who want censorship to continue leave for Bluesky.\n \nreply",
      "> Twitter defends free speech.\nDo you just take everything someone says at face value?\n \nreply",
      "Musk kicked off a bunch of Lfetist and progressive accounts when he took over. He rigged the platform to favor people with his political views. He sold check marks to put posts at the top of conversations to drown the platform in posts from his fan club. There\u2019s nothing about free speech happening on twitter.The people leaving for other platforms don\u2019t want censorship. They want to get away from a toxic environment. Claiming otherwise is either ignorant or dishonest. (I have never had an account on twitter or any similar platform; I just pay attention to what people who used to like it and now hate it say.)\n \nreply",
      "> It succeeded because it looked and felt like Twitter, from an era before Musk, and because it already had a sizable, active, and fun userbase.Bluesky is not a good place. On X you can go and post controversial thing. For example even if you believe X is full of ultra-far right nazis, you can still go there and post \"there are an infinity of genders\". You won't get censored.Try to go to Bluesky and post \"Only human born with the XY chromosomes can get pregnant\" and see what happens: as soon as your post gets noticed, you'll see that the wokes are in control and they'll censor you. Science much.There was no freedom of speech on Twitter before Musk bought it. And there's none on Bluesky.It's a leftist echo chamber and there's nothing fun in that.There's a reason people make fun of it calling it \"Bluecry\" and \"Pedosky\": if you post things like \"Trans dancing in nylon and garter belt with a little kid at the Olympics opening ceremony at a time when hundreds of millions of children were watching was beautiful\", you won't get banned.It's the place where all the full on nutsies went now that X / Twitter is not anymore in control of the wokes.And you're supposed to believe \"X evil / Bluesky all fun and nice\" because propaganda pieces with an agenda want you to believe that.These people still don't get it: it's because of them that Trump got elected.\n \nreply"

    "summary": "Welcome to the latest cringe fest on <em>bugeyedandshameless.com</em>, where self-proclaimed internet refugees champion the rise of the NormieNet \u2013 an echo chamber so echoey, even the echos have echos! Excited commentators, armed with the depth of a puddle, either lament the fall of 'Free Speech Twitter' or champion the sanitized sanctity of Bluesky, amusingly missing the irony in their acerbic binary banter. Meanwhile, seasoned keyboard warriors undermine each other with the fervor of toddlers fighting over the last chicken nugget, proving once and for all that no platform can truly contain the human urge to argue about absolutely nothing.\ud83d\udcac\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude02"
