      "I'd echo the sentiment that this is amazing, and that a TV guide would be awesome.I'd also suggest maybe adding the channel names (like the comment you posted here) to the app itself (although i think it's cool when it's unnamed and you get the old-school feeling of channels just being numbers).Also, I'd love to have permalinks for the channels. Not for the individual videos themselves, but just a link that when sharing would bring somebody else to the same channel you're watching right now.Another thing, although probably outside your control, is that I use a Firefox extension called \"SoundFixer\" that I use to force the youtube audio to mono (since a lot of channels are annoying to me using headphones, they pan the audio sources too hard left/right and it's super distracting), but it doesn't seem to work on this website, probably because of the way they're embedded. I don't know if this can be changed somehow, or have a mode to force mono audio (which would be also oldschool like old TVs with one speaker only!). It's probably too niche and hard to do though.Also I don't seem to find any volume control except mute?\n \nreply",

I sometimes also just open a web image in mpv and rotate it like that to avoid tilting my head.I also have these binds for unbalanced audio, mainly used with 5.1 audio to sound better on headphones or stereo speakers, and the \\ bind one seems to make normal stuff slightly louder also, so sometimes I hit it when I don't wanna turn up my speaker knob for one video.    \\ af         toggle lavfi=[dynaudnorm=f=100]\n\n    | af         toggle lavfi=loudnorm\n \nreply",

      "As someone with minor but noticeable hearing issues, the reason it's so jarring is because our brain's audio processing center depends on both ears for understanding human speech.If you're deaf in one ear, your ability to hear and understand speech in particular goes down a lot, even if someone is talking on your good side. Put that person in a noisy crowd and it's game over.\n \nreply",
      ">> Put that person in a noisy crowd and it's game over.That's when you discover you can lip read to a certain degree.  There is way more to it than that.  Speech is only one of the sets of cues we use when discoursing.  Hand gestures, body posture, facial expressions and more are all involved too.I'm somewhat deaf in both ears, worse in one and always have been.  I have had tinnitus since birth.  My deafness does not affect all frequencies equally.  Thankfully its mostly the high frequencies that have gone a bit dark and the tinnitus may be largely to blame.Anyway, your senses are all linked up and your brain is rather good at making connections to try and make up for deficiencies in some areas by co-opting other bits.  I have minor lip reading skills to augment my hearing.  I can't help it!  I also swivel somewhat to try and deploy my better ear as the situation allows.  One must try and maintain decorum and not look too weird 8)\"If you're deaf in one ear, your ability to hear and understand speech in particular goes down a lot, even if someone is talking on your good side.

      "In the real world you almost never hear something on one ear but not the other. Even if something is on your left, your right ear still hears it (differences in timing and volume inform your brain on the sound source location). Exception being if it's something really quiet right next to one ear, but that's relatively rare.So when things are mixed \"improperly\" (it's subjective), it's very distracting to me. I don't need to force mono everywhere, but it's very common in amateurish channels, and surprisingly also in movies and TV shows. Big productions tend to mix assuming you'll play on speakers (where it's fine to have something playing on just one channel/speaker, since both your ears will hear it), but when it mixes down to stereo and you listen on headphones, it's soooo common for them to pan something 100% to one channel when the source is supposed to be on that side. Like, somebody speaking to the left of the camera, and it comes 100% on the left channel and 0% on the right one. It's so unnatural and annoying to me.\n \nreply",

      "What a fun hack!One small note: the post seems slightly confused about the use of OpenType features, as it calls for:    font-feature-settings: \"colr\", \"calt\";\n\nbut there's no 'colr' feature tag in the font's OpenType layout tables, so that's meaningless here.I suppose this was intended to \"activate\" the color glyph table (COLR) in the font; but that isn't an OpenType layout feature that would be controlled by font-feature-settings, and doesn't need to be \"turned on\" like this.(In addition, the 'calt' feature is (according to the spec[1]) supposed to be active by default, so it shouldn't be necessary to explicitly set it either.

      "A long time ago I did something similar but rather than sorting I just kept index lists for each direction and the objects sorted themselves. Meaning like there are 4 lists `objectIndicesSortedByLeftEdge/RightEdge/TopEdge/BottomEdge`  If an object moves horizontally then it updates its own indices in the leftEdge and rightEdge arrays. This is because as it moves it likely only has to swap 1 or 2 indices at most to move itself.\n \nreply",

      "One interesting note on this approach is that the author suggests using a \"fast\" sorting algorithm like mergesort/quicksort as the sorting algorithm for best performance.  But in practice, you may get better performance from a \"worse\" sorting algorithm: insertion sort.The reason is that objects in collision detection systems tend to move relatively small steps between frames, meaning you can keep lists from the previous frame that are already mostly sorted.  For sorting these mostly sorted lists, insertion sort tends towards O(n) while Quicksort tends towards O(n^2)!\n \nreply",
      "The author covers this pretty much exactly as you describe it. From Part 2 of TFA,> Let\u2019s look at the sort step, which is the bottleneck of the algorithm according to the analysis.> You can see that most of the time, the sort does nothing at all! The list is almost always already sorted from the previous frame.> Even when it becomes unsorted, it usually just takes a couple of swaps to be sorted again.> Here\u2019s insertion sort in action:\n \nreply",
      "If you use a modern sort, it'll just go \"Oh that's sorted, we're done\". Pattern Defeating Quicksort will do that and so would Glidesort, Driftsort, IPNsort and so on. Most of these algorithms will also correctly shortcut trivial \"almost sorted\" cases like 123457689 (only longer, if you really only have nine elements you want a custom sort for that, there will be a correct algorithm and it's probably written down somewhere already)Rust's old sorts, both of them, get this right. There's a fair chance the current version of your C++ stdlib even gets this right in its unstable sort. In 1965 it's understandable that you reach for an insertion sort for this case, in 2024 it's embarrassing if your language doesn't provide a built-in sort where this just works.\n \nreply",

      "There is an alternative to sorting every step : Build your indexing structure a little looser, so that you catch the candidates collisions when object have moved less than epsilon.For example that can be done by increasing the radius of the spheres by epsilon.\nAs long as the spheres have not moved by epsilon, you don't need to recompute the index.To avoid latency peaks when you do need to recompute the index, you can start building a lagging index by sorting 10% each frame (aka amortizing the computation cost). After 10 frames you have an index that is valid as long as the position is within epsilon of the position 10 frames ago.\n \nreply",
      "I'm a big fan of spatial grid hashes to simplify situations like this. Nice to see other approaches. Iterative Insertion sorting would be easier to port to a compute shader than a spatial grid hash, so maybe this method is better if we get into the millions of objects range?\n \nreply"

      "I worked on this experiment as an undergrad ~10 years ago during my freshman year! We built a Cherenkov radiation detector, focusing magnets, and did tons of simulations.This is all from memory, but I remember the beamline setup was to get protons from the accelerator there, smash them into a target, which produced various charged particles which could be focused with the magnets, sent down a long pipe where they would decay into neutrinos et al. Then, there's a near detector and a far detector (far detector deep underground in South Dakota). The aim is to measure the neutrino flavors at both detectors to better understand the flavor oscillations (and look for asymmetries between neutrino/anti-neutrino oscillations, hopefully to help explain the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the universe).The particular bit I worked most on was studying the effects of adding an additional solid absorber at the end of the beamline, which was needed to absorb all the particles that didn't decay in the pipe. It would produce more neutrinos that were unfocused, so would affect the near-far flavor statistics (since these would be detected at the near detector but not the far since they were unfocused, ruining the statistics).

      "I was once involved in a similar (unintentional) experiment with a multi-billion dollar defence radar.  A several metres deep underground bunker, containing several 19\" racks full of electrical/electronic gear, filled to ground level with a combination of mineralised surface water and mud during a storm.What we wanted to do was cut the power, pump the water out of the bunker ASAP and immediately clean the whole lot with pure water.What the (arse-covering) site manager did was nothing, not even cut the power, until a \"risk-assessment\" had been done.  For the first few days we were able to peer into the bunker's hatch and watch der blinkenlights happily operating in the gloom underwater.  That stopped after a few days.  About a week later the risk had been assessed and a path of action determined: the power was turned off, the water was pumped out and everything was washed with pure water.  By then electrolysis had dissolved just about every conductor in the system.Electrical systems will happily cope with water in the short term, but the longer the exposure the less likely they are to survive.  Time is part of the risk.\n \nreply",

Is everybody wrong? Of course not. It is just that the statement \u201cdon\u2019t put metal in a microwave\u201d is a simplified form of the true statement which would go something like this \u201cdon\u2019t put metal in a microwave, unless you follow these safety precautions, and wear these safety gear, and your crucible is made of the appropriate materials, and your moulds are bone dry and \u2026\u201d.

I see it all the time with kids. They'll see some fundamental truth that takes a sideways perspective to see, and be told they're wrong, hacking off an interesting way of perceiving the world. It's unfortunate, but it's also something most adults are bad at, including myself.And, I very often microwave my spoons, forks, even metal bowls, without them heating up at all. But I also have a basic understanding of resonance, absorption, insulation, apertures, and the wavelengths involved. I don't do it at work, because it's not worth the effort responding to \"you're going to break the microwave\", even if you show them that the food is hot and the fork is cool.That said, I wouldn't melt metal in an expensive microwave. The metal has poor absorption relative to the magnetron antenna itself, so both will heat. I wouldn't be surprised if the antenna is also glowing a bit (at least early on)!\n \nreply",

If not, you can get an arc jumping from the metal to the wall and it can burn a hole in the wall of the oven.You should also put something (eg. a cup of water) in the oven to absorb some of the microwave energy.

      "> Ambients-like treatment of system boundariesProbably more in the thesis, but at a glance this mention isn't further defined or referenced.  The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_calculus is quite beautiful and IMHO doesn't get the attention it deserves.  Undergrad as far as I know never covers it, and most people I meet have never heard of it.  AFAIK tuplespaces also are not usually taught, and people that have heard of it tend to dismiss it as \"just some obsolete old java thing\" because the most popular implementation probably does fit in that category.  A shame since this is really cool stuff.One problem that I see with all 3 technologies (ambients, tuplespaces, and syndicate) is that they sit somewhere at the intersection of  datastructures / infrastructure / frameworks, but don't have clear and obvious deployment options.  Compare this with say, akka on kubernetes.  No matter how cool your tech is, this is an immediate non-starter for everything except academic investigation or low-level systems programming.  Synit for user-space sounds neat, but if syndicate is generally a better model than Akka and additionally productionizing the other great ideas of past concurrency research, then it would be awesome to see the gap for other use-cases addressed.\n \nreply",

I think it's simply still science fiction and the cutting edge of distributed research which isn't very popular in academia these days. Actors (1978) are just now barely becoming mainstream with the hype of Elixir and rediscovery of Erlang, even though the world still runs on multithreaded C and dead locks.The tech is cool, but no one is being paid just yet to create practical languages and environments out of this. As in many other scientific endeavours, mainstream programming paradigms tend to lag 20 or 30 years compared to the research.\n \nreply",
      "There's been an increasing interest in the Fediverse and local-first programming. Not quite mainstream, but they are well out of the academia.I have never heard of these ideas about the Syndicated Actor, but they seem like they might hold answers for issues in the Fediverse and make implementing local-first software more practical,.We have things with synchronizing state between web clients and servers and jump though all kinds of hoops with that (example, Relay), and I wonder if this would help with that. Lumen (Elixir on WASM) has stalled in development and LiveView is popular, but maybe with this, that is not what we want to do anyways.We have things like event-driven architecture, microservices, and DDD, but maybe that results from using narrowly-scoped primitives that isn't suitable for everything. But we use it for adjacent use-cases because that is all we have for commercial languages.I'd love to see how this can work out in Elixir.\n \nreply",

Monotonicity, vector clocks, multi-panos style domain partitioning, these are partial answers for making this kind of thing be a foundation you can reason about and still scale.\n \nreply",
      "I'm very interested in concurrency and new paradigms from a pragmatic perspective. Maybe it's because I'm practically minded, but I don't have the energy to parse this type of content (and that's ok, not blaming anyone).That said, I really, really appreciate when I can see a tangible piece of code that solves a real problem. In the case of concurrency, perhaps a hello world from an actor, ping pong, a chat room, cancellation, timeout or similar. Show something that's easy to do in this model, which is tedious to do in different models. (This shouldn't be hard to find, since concurrency is ridiculously easy to get wrong in most languages).If a partial goal is to engage practicians, then code samples is very effective.

      "There's a lot of existing legislation around the world about discounting as well.In many countries to be able to discount you need to have sold an item at full price for a certain amount of time, and you can't discount for more than another amount of time (i.e. to prevent perpetual discounting).In some countries you can't sell the same item at different prices for different customers. You can issue different discount codes to different customers, but those would likely need to be widely applicable so that it's not just different pricing in disguise.Having worked in an ecommerce company, I'm excited by the prospect of better automated pricing tools and tools that can do things like target sell-through by a particular date. However as a consumer and keen advocate for consumer rights, I'm concerned about a future where every last penny is eeked out of consumers by automated systems designed to identify ways they can be exploited with pricing.\n \nreply",
      "I believe the term you're looking for is consumer surplus, and the economic concept they're enabling is effectively perfect price discrimination.\n \nreply",
      "Looks very relevant. If the same service (e.g same instance of the model, or even different instances of the same model) is provided to more than one client, I'd guess a prosecutor might reach for it.Easiest but most costly way this could be avoided is by creating new models for each client using the client's own specific data and keeping the data and models fully isolated for each client.If derivative insights are gathered across all models, it'd have to be one-way informing e.g business decisions for the overall company rather than informing how the models themselves operate.---edit: \"We pivoted to a 'global model' that used data across countries to significantly reduce the amount of data required in any one country.\"This might paint a bullseye on their back, but I'm a security and risk person, not a lawyer.\n \nreply",
      "An actually cool use case of AI. Congrats on the launch.Some questions:1) I\u2019m assuming by \u201cpersonalizing discount across users\u201d, you mean personalized one-time coupon codes? I wonder if the UX of seeing one price in regular Chrome and one in incognito would be upsetting. I also don\u2019t know how price discrimination works but seems relevant?2) I\u2019d love to understand more about how for smaller retailers there\u2019ll be enough data to make meaningful discount programs for a limited set of consumers? Will data from similar/multiple retailers be bucketed?3) Any numbers/data on effectiveness so far?\n \nreply",
      "Thank you!1) Yes, personalization might have a bit of an experience tradeoff. We can try to mitigate this with messaging like \"flash discount\" or \"just for you\". But we also want to  make it optional for merchants. In my experience there's still a lot of improvements from other things too like dynamically adjusting discounts and varying the discounts across products2) One of the takeaways from my time at Uber was that certain predictors of discount efficiency held pretty constant across markets. A couple were conversion rate (if more ppl were going to convert without the discount, it's less efficient to give the discount) and profit margin. We're betting that we can train a model to generalize these trends across stores to create a bump in performance.3) We'll be kicking off our first case study with a customer in a couple weeks. At Uber, just varying the discount across merchants on Uber Eats improved the profitability of the discount by 40% (mostly because we were able to take advantage of differences in commission rates across merchants).\n \nreply",
      "Very cool. Saw you were H \u201810 - go crimson! Best of luck!\n \nreply",
      "I have a few dumb questions for people who really understand how this stuff works:- Is prediction based on historic transaction and sales data effective? I always assumed transaction and sales data in isolation didn't contain enough information to be effective predictors of buying behavior. Is that wrong?- How much more effective is it than a human intuitively setting a discount? I can see large retailers saving time on having to set discounts for a large number of products. Just wondering if small merchants would just be better off doing it themselves.\n \nreply",
      "1) What we're really doing with this first product is predicting how price impacts conversion rate. That's been a relatively simple thing to measure in my experiences. It's more difficult to do things like predict a customer's probability of buying based on their order history.2) Yes so we don't have a case study comparing us to manually setting discounts, but the task gets pretty time consuming quickly if you want to update the discount daily (or more frequently) and personalize the discount (which is one of the features we're planning on adding).\n \nreply",
      "Re: small merchants. Thats what I dont get. The companies that need this are the big ones not the small merchants with relatively few products they wish to discount. They\u2019re better off investing time and effort to making more sales not nickeling and diming with discounts\n \nreply"

      "When he wrote 'arpeggiator', I was thinking this was going to go in another direction- holding down a single key that starts at a letter and then releasing the key as it reaches the letter you want.  Because when I think an arpeggiator on a synthesizer, it's done via holding a key while notes repeat.I always was very good at texting on a number-pad phone, via repeated presses-  pressing (4) two times for a \"H\", pressing (3) two times for an \"E\", pressing (5) three times for an \"L\", etc etc. I was so used to this that I didn't even progress to using T9 texting before blackberrys and smartphones took over.So I thought... taking that idea, and doing a press-and-hold while letters scroll by, could be pretty fast.  And you could dial up the repeat rate until you started making mistakes. Map 8 keys for letters, one key for a space bar and long-press for extras, one key for backspace and long press for extras, and I think you'd be able to hit much more than 10 w.p.m. that the author winds up hitting.Only problem: this can't be instantiated as a normal USB compliant keyboard and allow you to see the letters scrolling as you hold, without a specialty keyboard app for the phone.\n \nreply",

      "This app is not exactly your idea but it is along the same lines. You \"drive\" towards the letter you want by shifting your finger.

      "This is one of the many[1] reminders that a lot of people want a smartphone with a hardware keyboard.Personally I have a small bluetooth mechanical keyboard, it saved me a couple of times when I wanted to do heavy text editing and only had a smartphone with me.I would welcome another option - small like this one - for casual texting and gaming.[1]: 900+ votes for a keyboard case here earlier: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38871987\n \nreply",
      "I think the concept of not wanting to use touch keyboards on a smartphone is wildy more popular than actually wanting a hardware keyboard on your smartphone. I.e. 900 upvotes is probably more to say people dislike where they have to settle more than many liking the idea (and practice) of actually changing their choice of compromises. It'd be so frickin' convenient but, at the same time, so is basically any other concept that would take up a ton more of your pocket/hand space.On that front I'm surprised Clicks doesn't have any options at all to have it double as an extra external battery. The size of the external battery case market is probably 50x+ the volume of the external keyboard market and that'd be a pretty unique differentiator in that segment. It's even something they responded to in their FAQ.\n \nreply"
