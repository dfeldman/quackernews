      "OpenAI is racing against two clocks: the commoditization clock (how quickly open-source alternatives catch up) and the monetization clock (their need to generate substantial revenue to justify their valuation).The ultimate success of this strategy depends on what we might call the enterprise AI adoption curve - whether large organizations will prioritize the kind of integrated, reliable, and \"safe\" AI solutions OpenAI is positioning itself to provide over cheaper but potentially less polished alternatives.This is strikingly similar to IBM's historical bet on enterprise computing - sacrificing the low-end market to focus on high-value enterprise customers who would pay premium prices for reliability and integration. The key question is whether AI will follow a similar maturation pattern or if the open-source nature of the technology will force a different evolutionary path.\n \nreply",
      "The problem is that OpenAI don't really have the enterprise market at all. Their APIs are closer in that many companies are using them to power features in other software, primarily Microsoft, but they're not the ones providing end user value to enterprises with APIs.As for ChatGPT, it's a consumer tool, not an enterprise tool. It's not really integrated into an enterprises' existing toolset, it's not integrated into their authentication, it's not integrated into their internal permissions model, the IT department can't enforce any policies on how it's used. In almost all ways it doesn't look like enterprise IT.\n \nreply",
      "This remind me why enterprise don't integrated OpenAI product into existing toolset, trust is root reason.It's hard to provide trust to OpenAI that they won't steal data of enterprise to train next model in a market where content is the most valuable element, compared office, cloud database, etc.\n \nreply",
      "> It's hard to provide trust to OpenAI that they won't steal data of enterprise to train next modelBit of a cynical take. A company like OpenAI stands to lose enormously if anyone catches them doing dodgy shit in violation of their agreements with users. And it's very hard to keep dodgy behaviour secret in any decent sized company where any embittered employee can blow the whistle. VW only just managed it with Dieselgate by keeping the circle of conspirators very small.If their terms say they won't use your data now or in the future then you can reasonably assume that's the case for your business planning purposes.\n \nreply",

      "This is what the Azure OpenAI offering is supposed to solve, right?\n \nreply",
      "This is what's so brilliant about the Microsoft \"partnership\".  OpenAI gets the Microsoft enterprise legitimacy, meanwhile Microsoft can build interfaces on top of ChatGPT that they can swap out later for whatever they want when it suits them\n \nreply",
      "Is their valuation proposition self fulfilling: the more people pipe their queries to OpenAI, the more training data they have to get better?\n \nreply",
      "I don't think user submitted question/answer is as useful for training as you (and many others) think. It's not useless, but it's certainly not some goldmine either considering how noisy it is (from the users) and how synthetic it is (the responses). Further, while I wouldn't put it past them to use user data in that way, there's certainly a PR/controversy cost to doing so, even if it's outlined in their ToS.\n \nreply",
      "In enterprise, there will be long content or document be poured into ChatGPT if there isn't policy limitation from company, which can be a meaning training data.At least, there's possibility these content can be seen by staff in OpenAI as bad case, there's still existing privacy concerns.\n \nreply"

Commenters, well-versed in their roles as cyber Cassandras, debate vigorously whether ChatGPT is the golden goose or just another overhyped, undercooked tech turkey. Trusted like a kleptomaniac at a swap meet, the verdict on enterprise adoption hangs more precariously than a Hollywood marriage."

Please output in JSON.> First, add a field called \"type\" that is one of: Wildlife, Architecture, Landscape, People or other.  Pick the one that most appropriately reflects the subject of the photo.  Use Other if you don't feel confident in your answer.> Next, if it is Wildlife, please add another field called \"animal\" that gives a general type of animal that is the focus of the photo.  Use large, common types like Elephant, Bird, Lion, Fish, Antelope, etc.  Do not add this field if your confidence is low.> If the type of animal is Bird, add a field called \"bird\" that gives the common type of bird, if you can clearly determine it.  For example: Eagle, Hummingbird, Vulture, Crow, etc.> If it is an Architecture photo, and you can determine with good confidence what specific building (or city) it is a photo of, please add a field called \"place\" with that name.

      "> the endpoints need to use large buffers to hold a copy of all the unacknowledged data, as is required by the TCP protocol.It makes me wonder if anyone has tried to break down the layers to optimize this. In the fairly common case of serving a file off of long-term storage you can jut fetch the old data if needed (likely from the page cache anyways, but still better than duplicating it) and some encryption algorithms are seekable so you can redo the encryption as well.Right now the kernel doesn't really have a choice but to buffer all unacknowledged data as the UNIX socket API has no provision for requesting old data from the writer. But a smarter API could put the application in charge of making that data available as required and avoid the need for extra copies in common cases.I know that Netflix did lots of work with the FreeBSD kernel for file to socket and eventually adding in-kernel TLS to remove user space from the equation. But I don't know if they went as far to remove the socket buffers.\n \nreply",
      "This is an \"old\" problem that has historically been addressed through things like \"Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs)\" that are defined in RFC 3135 and RFC 3449. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-enhancing_proxy)In internet-style communications, such as routing IP traffic over satellite links to low-earth-orbit or GEO, with much longer round-trip times, link latency is substantially higher than most terrestrial wired or wireless applications and acknowledgements required as part of TCP take much longer to facilitate. PEPs as an example augment the connection allowing end-user/client devices in the network with inline-PEPs to retain their normal network settings and perform the task of running or starting sessions with higher TCP-window sizes, as a method for improving overall throughput.The utility of a PEP, or PEP-acting device goes up when you imagine multiple devices, or a network of devices attached to a satellite communications terminal for WAN/backhaul connections as the link's performance can be managed at one point versus on all downstream client devices.\n \nreply",
      "There aren't necessarily extra copies even when just using TCP, thanks to sendfile(2) and similar mechanisms.Buffer size isn't that much of an issue either, given the relatively low latencies involved and that you can indicate which parts exactly are missing pretty accurately these days with selective TCP acknowledgements, so you'll need at most a few round trips to identify these to the sender and eventually receive them.Practically, you'll probably not see much loss anyway, for better or worse: TCP historically interpreted packet loss as congestion, instead of actual non-congestion-induced loss on the physical layer. This is why most lower-layer protocols with higher error rates than Ethernet usually implement some sort of lower-layer ARQ to present themselves as \"Ethernet-like\" to upper layers in terms of error/loss rate, and this in turn has made loss-tolerant TCP (such as BBR, as described in the article) less of a research priority, I believe.\n \nreply",

I used Globax back in the day to speed up one-way satellite service: https://web.archive.org/web/20040602203838/http://globax.inf...Back then traffic was around 10 cents per megabyte in my city, so satellite service was a good way to shave off these costs.\n \nreply",
      "I noticed a huge improvement just switching to stock BBR to my Starlink as well. During a particularly congested time I was bouncing between 5 to 12 Mbps via Starlink. With BBR enabled I got a steady 12. The main problem is that you need BBR on the server for this to work, as a client using Starlink I don't have any control over what all the servers I connect to are doing. (Other than my one server I was testing with).I like Huston's idea of a Starlink-tuned BBR, I wonder if it's a traffic shaping that SpaceX could apply themselves in their ground station datacenters? That'd involve messing with the TCP stream though, maybe a bad idea.The fact that Starlink has this 15 second switching built in is pretty weird, but you can definitely see it in every continuous latency measure. Even weirder it seems to be globally synchronized: all the hundreds of thousands of dishes are switching to new satellites the same millisecond, globally. Having a customized BBR aware of that 15 second cycle is an interesting idea.\n \nreply",

The Github README says:> The Acton Run Time System (RTS) offers a distributed mode of operation allowing multiple computers to participate in running one logical Acton system. Actors can migrate between compute nodes for load sharing purposes and similar. The RTS offers exactly once delivery guarantees. Through checkpointing of actor states to a distributed database, the failure of individual compute nodes can be recovered by restoring actor state. Your system can run forever!> NOTE: Acton is in an experimental phase and although much of the syntax has been worked out, there may be changes.I'd like a lot more info on how this checkpointing mechanism and discovery/communication works.\n \nreply",

      "I was confused by that too.

Acton is a statically typed language, which means the type of all values must be known when we compile the program. Unlike many traditional languges like Java or C++, where types must be explicitly stated everywhere, we can write most Acton programs without types. The Acton compiler features a powerful type inferencer which will infer the types used in the program.> Acton implements the Hindley-Milner (HM) type system, which is common in languages with static types, like Haskell and Rust. Acton extends further from HM to support additional features.The language also has inheritance (and thus presumably subtyping), protocols (interfaces, I think), and generics. Historically, those features have not played nice with HM inference, so I'm not sure what's going on there.[1]: https://acton.guide/types/intro.html\n \nreply",

I haven't looked too closely yet.Strong: Python is strongly typed with a similar syntax.Strong vs weak typing means \"how much information does the type system provide to me.\" Static vs weak typing means \"when does the type system do its work.\"I see no reason why a language with syntax like this could not be strongly typed. The static part is hard to claim until the type inference rules are explained.\n \nreply",

      "Messenger apps don't claim that this history should be global and consistent. The order in which messages were sent and received by my device is a perfectly fine (and I'd say intuitive) history. It is the order people (and their records, if they have some) would have had in mind in the old time.I take a different conclusion from the way people look at physical objects: since your device (or even my other device) is a different physical object than my device, I'd be wholly unsurprised to find a different order there.\n \nreply",
      "> Messenger apps don't claim that this history should be global and consistent.The fact that we're talking about multiple people looking at the same chat - the fact that we do conceptualise it as \"the same chat\" and \"the history\" - implies that we think of it as a single thing. And I think messenger apps generally nudge us that way - e.g. setting the name of the chat usually sets it for everyone.> It is the order people (and their records, if they have some) would have had in mind in the old time.I don't think it is. If I pull my correspondence with person X out of my drawer or file, the only dates I have to order them by are the dates written on the letters - which are the letters they and I (if I keep carbons of the ones I send) wrote them on, not the dates I received them. If they sent me a postcard while on holiday and then a letter after returning that arrived sooner, I'll read them in one order on receipt and in a different order when looking back. Likewise if I have a memo of a phone call with them, that may be from before I received a letter that is nevertheless dated earlier.\n \nreply",
      "> I think messenger apps generally nudge us that way - e.g. setting the name of the chat usually sets it for everyone.That's a good point - maybe it's actually email that warped my mind.> I'll read them in one order on receipt and in a different order when looking backAlso a good point, I was thinking more about business communication where the date the letter is received matters. Thinking back on it, I think the main difference is that the messenger apps might happily reorder message before (or while) I read them. And if only one order is to be available, the one of the most use to me for an instant messaging app is the one I received the messages in, but I get how for other use cases it would be different.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "After lots of conversations with Element colleagues about message order in\nMatrix, and lots of surprises for me, I wanted to write down what I had learned\nbefore I forgot, and also write down some principles I think we should try to\nfollow. A lot of this is just my half-formed opinions, and while I am very\ngrateful to everyone who helped educate me about all of this, it in no way\nrepresents any kind of policy or consensus from Element or Matrix or anyone else\n:-)If you're writing a Matrix client (e.g. a chat app), you need to ask the server\nfor messages that have been sent in a room. To do this, you need to download the\n\"events\", which are just messages plus other things you might need to know\nabout. Messages are one type of \"timeline\" event, meaning that they appear in\nthe main display area of a room, showing you what people said.The first and most common way to do this is to ask for the latest stuff that's\nhappened, by hitting the\n/sync API:(Note: we're not talking about\n\"state\"\neven",
    "summary": "In a world where consistent temporal ordering is too pass\u00e9 for the hip disruptors at Matrix, a brave blog emerges to unfurl the convoluted chronicles of chat chaos. The author, humble yet confused, scribbles down a manifesto of \"half-formed opinions\" on why your next message might just quantum leap ahead of your last. Commenters leap into the fray with the zest of philosophers arguing over a misdelivered postal letter, touting their bespoke solutions like they're selling snake oil at a tech conference. Witness the spectacle where techies dictate UX laws with the certainty of toddlers dictating bedtime stories, all while the chat timeline twitches like a broken metronome. \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\ud83d\ude43"
