Previously it mostly worked, but we had to do some massaging on our end (backtick removal, etc.).With that said, this will be great for GPT-4o-mini, as it often struggles/forgets to format things as we ask.Note: we haven't had the same success rate with function calling compared to pure JSON mode, as the function calling seems to add a level of indirection that can reduce the quality of the LLMs output YMMV.Anyhow, excited for this![0]https://magicloops.dev\n \nreply",

      "Good job releasing your project! It's a cool idea and surprisingly minimalist. That said, I've found a number of cryptographic flaws in the application source. This should not be used in instances where the encryption is mission-critical.1) You generate a random key [0] and then feed it into PBKDF2 [1] to generate a 32-byte AES-GCM key. If you can generate 32 random bytes instead of 10 reduced-ASCII characters and a key stretch, just do that. PBKDF2 is for turning a password into a key, and it's far from the recommended algorithm nowadays; prefer scrypt if you need to do this sort of thing.2) AES-GCM with random 12-byte nonces. Never use random IVs with GCM; this breaks the authentication [2] [3]. Given the pitfalls of AES-GCM with respect to random nonces, you might prefer switching to XSalsa20+Poly1305. The advantage of XSalsa is it has an extended nonce length, so you can use random nonces without fear.3) Random key derivation with a restricted character set can make brute force attacks easier. You should have a 256-bit random key, and if you want that key to be within a certain character set, then encode the byte output from the CSPRNG using that character set.4) 1fps achieves symmetric key distribution via a URL with a fragment identifier (\"#\") which IIRC is not sent to the server. Therefore it assumes you have a secure key distribution channel - the link contains the key, so it's important that only the intended recipient can view the part after the \"#\". If the server is truly malicious, it can deploy client-side Javascript to send the fragment to the server, allowing the server to access the key (and thus cleartext communication).[0]: https://github.com/1fpsvideo/1fps/blob/main/1fps.go#L99[1]: https://github.com/1fpsvideo/1fps/blob/main/1fps.go#L287[2]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475.pdf[3]: https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/\n \nreply",

      "There's two issues.Background: the key+IV define a keystream which is xor-ed against the message. The same key+IV generate the same keystream. Thus you can XOR two cipher texts and reveal information from the two plaintext.AES-GCM is authenticated encryption. To combat known-ciphertext-attacks, you want to have authenticated cipher texts. AES-GCM specifically is vulnerable to an attack with a reused IV to recover the authentication key. Allowing you to forge authentication tags and employ a KCA.The solution, if you're stuck with aes, is to switch to XAES-GCM or better AES-GCM-SIV. Alternatively you must use a counter or checkes system to not reuse IV. Since this is in the context of 1fps, you could use unix timestamp + random bytes to reduce the chance of collisions.\n \nreply",
      "Is the statement just that if you use a random value for a nonce rather than some guaranteed never-used-once value, it's possible to get a collision faster than the \"natural\" block collision complexity (half block size or something like that)?\n \nreply",
      "Not an expert, but this is my understanding.1. It is necessary for nonces to never be re-used for a given key lest you open yourself to a certain class of attacks that can decode all messages using that key. This is specific to AES-GCM due to how it internally reuses nonces.2. AES-GCM uses very small nonces, making the probability of randomly using the same nonce unacceptably as the number of messages encoded with a given key increases (as it would with each frame sent on 1fps).You can avoid all this by using a different primitive with a longer nonce such as XSalsa (a version of Salsa with a 192-bit nonce)\n \nreply",
      "With regard to point 4 (secure key distribution channel), as far as I can tell there is no good pki built into the browser, My point being. any pki tooling has to be shipped by the server and you have to trust the server to supply you honest tools.

      "The BM25 thing is actually a really big deal.BM25 is similar to TF/IDF. In both cases, the key idea is to consider statistics of the overall corpus as part of relevance calculations. If the user searches for \"charities in new orleans\" in a corpus where \"new orleans\" is only represented in a few documents, those should clearly rank highly. If the corpus has \"new orleans\" in almost every document then the term \"charity\" is more important.PostgreSQL FTS cannot do this, because it doesn't maintain statistics for word frequencies across the entire corpus. This severely limits what it can implement in terms of relevance scoring - each result is scored based purely on if the search terms are present or not.For comparison, SQLite FTS (which a lot of people are unaware of) actually does implement full index statistics, and SQLite FTS5 implements BM25 out of the box.\n \nreply",

Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned.Full text search is a technique that finds entries in a collection of text based on the presence of specific keywords and phrases.\nMost search engines like Elasticsearch use the BM25 algorithm to rank search results. BM25 considers how often a term appears and how unique that term is across all documents.Full text search is different from similarity search, also known as vector search, which searches for and ranks results by semantic meaning.\nMany modern applications use a combination of full text and similarity search. This practice is called hybrid search and can yield more accurate results.Po",

I think this market is tremendously huge - from hobbyists on Reels, to enterprise creating employee trainings, to SMBs needing TikTok content, to information businesses working with mostly long-form video (which is the niche we are after).But because the market is so big, you need to be clear who can make the most from your tool, so that they can find you. This will also guide your feature set and your UX (e.g. we decided to never ever have a timeline, which is the opposite of everything else that was in the market at the time).

This meant that we\ncouldn\u2019t change the string type as the goal of the Arrow2 project was to follow the complete Arrow spec. End of last\nyear we forked parts of Arrow2 in the crate polars-arrow, which is a trimmed down implementation of the Arrow spec and\nis tuned for Polars\u2019 needs.Now we have the code under our control the refactor was imminent. As luck would have it, the Arrow spec was also finally\nmaking progress with adding the long anticipated German Style string types to the specification.

Meanwhile, in the comments section, self-proclaimed tech prophets come crawling out of the woodwork, offering unsolicited advice and debating the cataclysmic implications of German Style string types. It's the gift that keeps on giving: another day, another opaque tech refactor that will change absolutely nothing about how everyone outside the comments section lives their lives. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd27"

      "A lot of these ideas if taken literally would harm the person in the center.There's a long history of clinical psychology and evidence based psychology diverging, with the clinical psychologists adopting methods that actively harm their patients. The history starts of course with Freud, but another prominent example was the theory of recovered memories in the late 1900s.In this case, the ring theory was developed out of hurt because the first author felt hurt by something a colleague said. That's not generally a good basis for a theory of how to deal with something as complicated as trauma.Even the basic idea of a \"center\" is suspect. In many cases, a traumatic event is an event that affects multiple people who must interact. The classic example of trauma is warfare. Families go through trauma. Even when there isn't a common trauma, many conversations happen between individuals who have separate but comparable traumas. You don't want to get into a frame of mind where you have to judge and compare people's trauma to determine what they can and can't say.On top of that there is a lot of research on kvetching and whether it's good for patients. In most cases I'm aware of, it's harmful to them. Most evidence-based approaches, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), advocate the opposite of what this article is advocating. CBT says that the patient does best when they talk back to their own distorted thoughts. That means not thinking of yourself as the center of some universe, and not thinking of yourself as a \"why me\" victim that is targeted by some cosmic force. This article is saying diametrically the opposite; it says you should reinforce people's distorted thoughts.Of course, you have to be kind and gentle to someone when they're having a hard time. But that kindness can take a lot of forms, and this article is advocating a very particular and almost ideological approach.\n \nreply",

      "That's a fair point, and probably argues more for being able to take time off.  It's also worth noting that for most people outside the immediate circles (and from whom inward-dumping seems most prevalent and toxic) aren't utterly enmeshed in the constant struggle.Caregiving itself is extraordinarily trying and debilitating in that context.  I'd like to see better understanding, support, and options there.  Others' suggestions and experiences very much welcomed.Mayo Clinic on caregiver burnout:<https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9225-caregive...>Another issue of chronic / long-term caregiving is that there are often frictions and conflicts which develop within families or other smaller groups, often pitting immediate caregivers (e.g., a spouse or adult children living with or near (an) elderly parent(s)), and more distant siblings or other relations.Add in issues of long-standing relationship conflicts, cognitive decline, or paranoia and misperceptions arising as co-morbidities of many many long-term conditions or just simple old age, and the mix becomes all the more problematic.  Oftentimes this is further compounded by support organisations (governmental or otherwise) which often aren't, or which assume an adversarial stance for or against specific parties, often unfounded.\n \nreply",
      "That goes to a subtle and important point - although the advice in the article appears to be excellent in practice it is unfortunate that they led with the \"This isn\u2019t just about you.\" example. It is important to recall that, in a strategic sense, a crisis is not all about the person in crisis. An individual's crisis is can easily be a communal experience. Although it isn't a good time to start arguing with someone about that.I'd go as far as saying the person suffering will probably suffer a lot less if their attitude is one of \"although this is happening to me, this isn't all about me\". Acceptance of that truth helps lead to peace.\n \nreply",
