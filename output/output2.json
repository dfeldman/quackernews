      "Thanks for taking some interest in my project. It came from being frustrated with the state of SSGs over the past 10 years. I mostly just make static websites, and I wanted something that was simple and intuitive to me, and JSX seemed like a great fit. But I got very tired of the disproportionately scaled complexity of JSX frameworks like React. Long story short, I made an SSG that just renders JSX as strings. It was natural to extend that to the browser to just render JSX as DOM elements. And in a few cases (mostly layout) it lends well to shared components. Overall I'm happy with what I came up with, although some of it is admittedly a little hacky, and IDE support isn't as good as it could be.[edit] Oh also, this solution works really well for SEO. That's another problem I didn't find solved well in other JSX frameworks.\n \nreply",

      "not the hero we deserve but the villain we need\n \nreply",
      "What I\u2019m seeing here is not new. It\u2019s this vanilla pattern but with enough back support to leave off the framing and get the syntax highlighting:Var button = html(\u2019<button>im a button</button>\u2019);The html() function is trivial, but it just doesn\u2019t feel like real programming to do this, even though there\u2019s nothing else to it in the end.\n \nreply",
      "Downvote me but tell me why. The example is using .onclick, .textContent, etc in a completely vanilla way. I'm just pointing out you can get all the way vanilla and it still works. What's the issue?\n \nreply",
      "Returning actual DOM nodes entirely blunts the big advantage of JSX (and non-JSX libraries like Lit) - which is their immediate mode style API, and UI=f(state) model.You want to return a description of the DOM, rather than the real DOM, because you want to be able to reevaluate your templates repeatedly with new state, and efficiently update the DOM where that template is rendered to.All the examples here use imperative DOM APIs to do updates, like with this:    function TodoInput(attrs: { add: (v: string) => void }) {\n      const input = <input /> as HTMLInputElement;\n      input.placeholder = 'Add todo item...';\n      input.onkeydown = (e) => {\n        if (e.key === 'Enter') {\n          attrs.add(input.value);\n          input.value = '';\n        }\n      };\n      return input;\n    }\n\n    class TodoList {\n      ul = <ul class='todolist' /> as HTMLUListElement;\n      add(v: string) {\n        const item = <li>{v}</li> as HTMLLIElement;\n        item.onclick = () => item.remove();\n        this.ul.append(item);\n      }\n    }\n\nAvoiding those `input.onkeydown = ...` and `this.ul.append(item)` cases, and instead just iterating over items in your template, is probably the main benefit of a VDOM.(The problem with VDOMs is that diffing is slow, a problem solved by using templates that separate static from dynamic parts, like Lit - a library I work on).\n \nreply",
      "I agree with the sibling comment that this really depends on the user. To take a different approach: JSX is just a different DSL to the createElement function call pattern (see Preact.h for example) and all of the benefits you\u2019re describing come from the framework and runtime.More concisely: JSX is just an alternate function call syntax with some useful applications.For example at my last company we used JSX to make test data factories that had an XML-like look but were using a builder-pattern in the element creation that was able to make contextual decisions about what was in the final data. Nothing to do with React, DOM, or inability to express the same thing declaratively without JSX.\n \nreply",
      "> You want to return a description of the DOM, rather than the real DOM, because you want to be able to reevaluate your templates repeatedly with new state, and efficiently update the DOM where that template is rendered to.Depends who \"you\" are.  I prefer to have my DOM nodes updated in place without all the reconciliation machinery. (no implication about what you want)\n \nreply",
      "If you work on a team of suitable size I would hesitate to not leverage a VDom. I trust myself to not trigger dumb reflows, but the way I see a lot of people using React this could be a perf nightmare.\n \nreply",
      "I think that hits the real problem: it\u2019s staffing and culture, not the tool. The 90th percentile site using a vDOM is also a perf nightmare, especially for anyone who doesn\u2019t have a recent Apple device on a fast network, and that often has big impacts on usability and accessibility as well (dynamic loading sucks on screen readers unless you put way more time into it that most people do).I was painfully reminded of that while visiting Europe last month on a data plan which was clearly deprioritized on partner networks - the old sites with .php in the URLs loaded in a few seconds and worked perfectly, but every time something failed to load in less than 5 minutes or partially loaded but didn\u2019t work a quick trip over to webpagetest.org showed a lot of NextJS, React, et al. scripts trickling in because clearly a form with half a dozen fields needs 25MB of JavaScript.The root cause is obvious: you get what you measure. If businesses prioritize Jira tickets closed per day, they\u2019re going to get this soup of things promising to be easy to use for high developer velocity and they\u2019re never going to get around to the optimizing it. If they\u2019re trying to be able to hire as cheaply as possible, they\u2019re going to look for the current tool boot camps are pushing and hire based on that, not looking for deeper knowledge of web standards or experience which costs more and shrink the candidate pool. If they\u2019re looking for a safe choice, Facebook\u2019s marketing means all of the big consulting companies will push React and few people will pause long enough to ask whether they\u2019re building the same kind of apps it was designed to build (long session times, tons of local state being mutated, etc.) or whether they\u2019re willing to invest the time needed to get it to perform reliably and well.\n \nreply"

I'm a member of the Tea Deliverers CTF team, and I participated in the DARPA CGC CTF back in 2016 with team b1o0p.There are a few issues that make it challenging to directly apply our AIxCC approaches to CTF challenges:1. *Format Compatibility:* This year\u2019s DEFCON CTF finals didn\u2019t follow a uniform format. The challenges were complex and involved formats like a Lua VM running on a custom Verilog simulator. Our system, however, is designed for source code repositories like Git repos.2. *Binary vs. Source Code:* CTFs are heavily binary-oriented, whereas AIxCC is focused on source code. In CTFs, reverse engineering binaries is often required, but our system isn\u2019t equipped to handle that yet. We are, however, interested in supporting binary analysis in the future!\n \nreply",
      "Everyone thinks bug bounties should be higher. How high should they be? Who should pay for them?\n \nreply",
      "It really depends on the target and the quality of the vulnerability. For example, low-quality software on GitHub might not warrant high bug bounties, and that's understandable. However, critical components like KVM, ESXi, WebKit, etc., need to be taken much more seriously.For vendor-specific software, the responsibility to pay should fall on the vendor. When it comes to open-source software, a foundation funded by the vendors who rely on it for core productivity would be ideal.For high-quality vulnerabilities, especially those that can demonstrate exploitability without any prerequisites (e.g., zero-click remote jailbreaks), the bounties should be on par with those offered at competitions like Pwn2Own. :)\n \nreply",

On the one hand, if you pay bug bounties, the bugs get fixed, and they sure seem expensive. But if you look into how much money is spent on valueless security theatre, it is a total drop in the bucket. But CrowdStrike hires security researchers!So what should the prices really be? For which vulnerabilities? The SolarWinds issue is probably worth more than $10m, if people are willing to pay 100x more to CrowdStrike for nothing.\n \nreply",

He'd then check the literature to identify them and every summer would find that he'd caught some that were unknown to science.The author's research was on parasitic wasps and he was one of the world's foremost authorities on the subject, yet his summer traps would even trap parasitic wasps that were not yet known to science.Think about that--this was not in some remote area that humans had barely reached where finding unknown plants and animals is something you'd expect.

The built-in Graph Data Science package has a lot of nice graph algos that are easy to reach for when you need things like community detection.The ability to \"land and expand\" efficiently (my term for how I think about KG's in Neo4j) is quite nice with Cypher.  Retrieval performance with \"land and expand\" is, however, highly dependent on your initial processing to build the graph and how well you've teased out the relationships in the dataset.    > I would rather stab myself with a fork than try to use Cypher to query a concept graph when better standards-based options are available.\n\nCypher is a variant of the GQL standard that was born from Cypher itself and subsequently the working group of openCypher: https://opencypher.org/More info:https://neo4j.com/blog/gql-international-standard/https://neo4j.com/blog/cypher-gql-world/\n \nreply",
      "While I'm all for standards-based options, I think the fetishization does a disservice to anyone dipping their toes into graph databases for the first time.

AuraDB provides an enterprise-level fully-managed offering which is table stakes for, say, relational databases. Obviously the author has a bias, but one of the overarching philosophical differences between Neo4J and a Triple Store solution is that the former is more flexible; that plays out in their downplaying of ontologies (which are important for keeping data manageable but are also hard to decide and iterate on).\n \nreply",

They also come with a pretty extensive set of list functions[0] and operators[1].Neo4j's UNWIND makes it relatively straightforward to manipulate the lists as well[2].I'm not super familiar with RDF triplestores, but what's nice about Neo4j is that it's easy enough to use as a generalized database so you can store your knowledge graph right alongside of your entities and use it as the primary/only database.[0] https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/list/[1] https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/operator...[2] https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/unwind/...\n \nreply",
      "It has been a while so maybe things have changed, but the main reasons I remember are 1) lists stored as a property must be a homogeneous list of simple builtin datatypes so no mixing of types, custom types, or language tagging like RDF has as first class concepts. 2) indexes on lists are much more limited ( exact match only iirc) so depending on the size of the data and the search parameters it could be a big performance issue. 3) cypher gets cumbersome if you have many multi-valued properties because every clause becomes any(elem in node.foo where <clause>). In Sparql it's just ?node schema:foo <clause>.I don't think everybody should run away from property graphs for RDF or anything, in terms of the whole package they are probably the right technical call ninety-something percent of the time.

      "I've been (semi-)intentionally unemployed for a little over a year now, and I reached a point a couple months ago where I just LOST IT at the prospect of having to continue to make decisions at every moment of every day about what to do next. I even have a daily checklist of about 15 things I need to do every day to keep making at least minimal progress toward my goals, but because none of them had assigned times, I was still having to choose every. damn. thing.So I decided the list should be done before lunch, which meant I could pick anything on the list, but it had to be something on the list. And after lunch, I have a list of three big-picture projects I can work on. I can choose any one of them, but it has to be one of them. Their next steps are reasonably well laid out, because I don't think I do generally have executive dysfunction issues, so I get to pick one of three projects and work on it until dinner.This has saved my sanity. I don't waste very much time at all now. I don't do well with strict routines, but these buckets take so much of the guess work out. In the morning, 15 options. In the afternoon, only 3. It's so much more manageable.\n \nreply",
      "This reminds me of some good practices I've learned from implementing GTD principals. Even with my massive GTD-style lists, which I love, having a small paper list for that day, even if it repeats what's on the massive digital list, is a very nice focus function.Also helpful is to have a list of no more than 3 weekly priorities. When I don't know what to focus on, I often look at those. They are most effective when I'm actually doing my weekly review. Also a practice that's so helpful and freeing.\n \nreply",

      "One reason this method seems good is that it requires you to write down a new list each day. For me at least, it's easier to write a fresh list and get started on that than to get motivated by a list I wrote before. Writing a new list makes me remember what I /want/ to get done, and why.\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019ve struggled with improving my executive functioning.I think it can be negatively affected by mental health issues and can take time to recover and get back to parity.I\u2019ve found that voice-memos are  particularly effective in assisting me. I\u2019ll talk through a problem and usually find solutions quickly, eg debugging.Am currently working on a (transcribed) voice-interface to improve in this area, right now.I might try out his formula tomorrow, possibly in voice.\n \nreply",
      "When I've been in low periods in terms of anxiety or mood, externalizing seems to be a salve. When I look back at how I've externalized in those periods, it seems excessive. It's like my executive functioning is no where in sight, and I can see that in how much I had to externalize to get a handle on things. But those periods of parity do return.It's great to hear you've found methods that work for you. Voice-memos must feel lower friction than writing things out.\n \nreply",

      "Funny, I\u2019ve been doing a TODO list almost exactly like this daily plan every business day since 2009. An important thing for me is to consider it s list of things that may eventually be accomplished so that I don\u2019t feel guilty when I don\u2019t tick all of them. One difference for me is that in calmer days and on Mondays I also check my financial status and my own personal KPIs. (Another is that I don\u2019t throw away, I generally keep them because I use notebooks.)This process works very well for me. I learned it while working as a stock broker, where every day I needed to check specific economic indicators that would be published or company disclosures, call client X, Y or Z, and in days where options, swaps or forwards would expire I needed to check a few things. So I kind of got that behaviour ingrained in me, and it has helped me immensely I think.\n \nreply",

      "The Mind Illuminated has a catchy spin on \u201cADD\u201d. The author(s) thinks the real problem is \u201cawareness deficit disorder\u201d. Attention is overused. It is after all a faculty that we feel we can control to a large degree. But our mind (or the untrained mind, meditation-wise) only has so much power/strength. If attention gets over-used then awareness will fail. Because you need a balance of attention and awareness (the ultimate balance is a state of mindfulness).You can train attention. Meditation helps. But a simpler start is to stop attending so much. Your problem might be overused attention; trying to \u201cdeal with\u201d attention head-on (which we so often do\u2014just fixate on the prima facie problem until it is solved) might just frustrate you.Many years ago I felt like I was emotionally fried. I couldn\u2019t deal with my narrating mind. I guess the real solution was to get a life. But that felt overwhelming. So I started taking walks every day. Eventually they became daily meditation walks (described in the book). Eventually I reached a point where I had so much awareness (due to not attending/fixating every waking second?) that I was more content with the world around me as it happened. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to distract myself as much. It was a start.\n \nreply",
      "> It\u2019s not just that we choose our own distractions; it\u2019s that the pleasure we get from being distracted is the pleasure of taking action and being free. There\u2019s a glee that comes from making choices, a contentment that settles after we\u2019ve asserted our autonomyAn interesting take, but I don't feel like I'm making a choice at all. In fact I'm often screaming at myself to stop scrolling and go to bed, but I don't. I never feel more powerless than when I am stuck in a distraction loop. I literally want to stop, but can't. There's no glee, no autonomy in that.\n \nreply",
      "It is typical of addictions that they are ineffective at solving the problems that make us seek them \u2014 so IMO it wouldn't be surprising if an urge for autonomy leads to scrolling which doesn't actually satisfy that urge. Note that the article a couple of paragraphs later mentions gamblers and occasional \u201cwinning\u201d that is in the long term losing.But I think a solution, or at least an experiment to test the hypothesis, is suggested by your reaction (\"When scrolling I feel powerless, no autonomy\") which is itself a desire for more autonomy: what happens if we instead cultivate the opposite value, less autonomy/freedom and more service/subordination/allegiance (to the job or sleep routine or whatever)?If the theory of the article is right, then a desire for autonomy leads to distraction which, being unsatisfying, only intensifies that desire. So cultivating the opposite (telling oneself \"What I need right now is actually not autonomy, but fidelity to higher goals\" or whatever) may curb the hunger for autonomy more effectively than our ineffective distraction does?\n \nreply",

That is enough to power a small circuit, sensor, or actuator, the researche",
    "summary": "MIT engineers, in their latest bout of making science fiction a tiresome reality, have crafted a battery so tiny, it might power your next middle-aged crisis about robot doctors swimming in your bloodstream. The revolutionary battery, skinnier than the patience of anyone reading its specs, is designed to be strong enough to fuel microbots that could roam our insides, because what we all need is microscopic robots telling us you should've skipped that extra donut, *right*? Commenters are split between praising the breathless marvels of science and spiraling into a dystopian panic about impending microbot overlords. Stay tuned for a future where your indigestion might just be a battery malfunction!"
