Featuring a screen barely visible to the human eye, this marvel of obscurity finally liberates users from the risk of actually enjoying media consumption or seeing what they type. Comment sections are ablaze with consumer futurologists, clamoring to proclaim the device as the herald of the 'minimal tech movement,' despite half of them likely squinting to grasp even the partial outline of their ASCII emojis. Free shipping on orders just a cent shy of $100 reminds everyone that good things come in micro, eye-straining packages. \ud83e\uddd0\ud83d\udd0d\ud83d\udcb8"
