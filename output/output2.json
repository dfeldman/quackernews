      "Something that would be really fun would be to run SQLite in-memory in a browser but use the same tricks as Litestream and Cloudflare Durable Objects (https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/13/zero-latency-sqlite-st...) to stream a copy of the WAL log to a server (maybe over a WebSocket, though intermittent fetch() POST would work too).Then on subsequent visits use that server-side data to rehydrate the client-side database.From https://sqlite.org/forum/info/50a4bfdb294333eec1ba4749661934... is looks like WAL mode is excluded from the default SQLite WASM build so you would have to go custom with that.\n \nreply",
      "There are many layers of that's not how it works at play here.In-memory SQLite databases don't use WAL. Wasm (and browser Wasm, in particular) doesn't support anything like the shared memory APIs SQLite wants for its WAL mode.Litestream requires a very precise WAL setup to work (which just so happens to work with the default native SQLite setup, but is hard to replicate with Wasm).Cloudflare Durable Objects may have been inspired by Litestream but works very differently (as do LiteFS, Turso, etc\u2026)The general idea of streaming changes from SQLite would work, but it's a lot of work, and the concurrency model of in-browser Wasm will make it challenging to implement.(I wrote that forum post some time ago, and have WAL working in a server side Wasm build of SQLite, but none of the options to make it work would make much sense, or be possible, in browser)\n \nreply",

      "WAL: Write ahead log, common strategy for DBs (sqlite, postgres, etc.) to improve commit performance. Instead of fsync()ing every change, you just fsync() a log file that contains all the changes and then you can fsync() the actual changes at your leisureShared memory API: If you want to share (mutable) data between multiple processes, you need some kind of procedure in place to manage that. How do you get a reference to the data to multiple processes, how do you make sure they don't trample each other's writes, etc.Concurrency model: There are many different ways you can formalize concurrent processes and the way they interact (message passing, locking, memory ordering semantics, etc.). Different platforms will expose different concurrency primitives that may not work the same way as other platforms and may require different reasoning or code structureDurable objects - I think this is some Cloudflare service where they host data that can be read or modified by your usersThis is all from memory, but IME, GPT is pretty good for asking about concepts at this level of abstraction\n \nreply",

      ">Takeaway #1: \"C and C++ are different: don\u2019t mix them, and don\u2019t mix them up\"Where \"mixing C/C++\" is helpful:- I \"mix C in with my C++\" projects because \"sqlite3.c\" and ffmpeg source code is written C.  C++ was designed to interoperate with C code.  C++ code can seamlessly add #include \"sqlite3.h\" unchanged.- For my own code, I take advantage of \"C++ being _mostly_ a superset of C\" such as using old-style C printf in C++ instead of newer C++ cout.Where the \"C is a totally different language from C++\" perspective is helpful:- knowing that compilers can compile code in \"C\" or \"C++\" mode which has ramifications for name mangling which leads to \"LINK unresolved symbol\" errors.- knowing that C99 C23 has many exceptions to \"C++ is a superset of C\" :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B...\n \nreply",
      "The entire I/O streams (where std::cout comes from) feature is garbage, if this was an independent development there is no way that WG21 would have taken it, the reason it's in C++ 98 and thus still here today is that it's Bjarne's baby. The reason not to take it is that it's contradictory to the \"Don't use operator overloading for unrelated operations\" core idea. Bjarne will insist that \"actually\" these operators somehow always meant streaming I/O but his evidence is basically the same library feature he's trying to justify. No other language does this, and it's not because they can't it's because it was a bad idea when it was created, it was still a bad idea in 1998, the only difference today is that C++ has a replacement.The modern fmt-inspired std::print and std::println etc. are much nicer, preserving all the type checking but losing terrible ideas like stored format state, and localisation by default. The biggest problem is that today C++ doesn't have a way to implement this for your own types easily, Barry illustrates a comfortable way this could work in C++ 26 via reflection which on that issue closes the gap with Rust's #[derive(Debug)].\n \nreply",
      "Remember that C++ originally didn't have variadic templates, so something like std::format would have been impossible back in the day.

It was a big improvement over printf(). Historic perspective is everything.\n \nreply",

      "Decades ago Linus Torvalds was asked in an interview if he feared Linux to be replaced by something new. His answer was that some day someone young and hungry would\ncome along, but unless they liked writing device drivers Linux would be safe.This is all paraphrased from my memory, so take it with a grain of salt. I think the gist of it is still valid: Projects like Asterinas are interesting and have a place, but they will not replace Linux as we have it today.(Asterinas, from what I understood, doesn't claim to replace Linux, but it a common expectation.)\n \nreply",
      "More recently, in a similar vein:> Torvalds seemed optimistic that \"some clueless young person will decide 'how hard can it be?'\" and start their own operating system in Rust or some other language.

Hohndel clarified that by \"clueless\", Torvalds was referring to his younger self; \"Oh, absolutely, yeah, you have to be all kinds of stupid to say 'I can do this'\", he said to more laughter. He could not have done it without the \"literally tens of thousands of other people\"; the \"only reason I ever started was that I didn't know how hard it would be, but that's what makes it fun\".https://lwn.net/Articles/990534/\n \nreply",

      "One great thing about this book is the 'stuff I didn't do' part.Layout is really hard. Just tables by themselves are hard, even without any css around them. CSS makes layout impossibly difficult. I challenge anyone to keep the whole CSS spec and its associated behaviors in their head.At this point css + html + javascript have become a dynamic PDL, and probably is one of the most complex pieces of software today.As an aside, video decoding is offloaded onto hardware, so it's not as battery intensive as it used to be.\n \nreply",
      "For the absolutely massive amount of code one needs to implement for production-grade CSS layout, the Servo source code is illustrative and IMO quite cool to see. For instance, this file just implements block and inline contexts; there's a bit of Rust boilerplate here, but the vast majority of lines are \"business logic\" around various parts of the specification. And there's a whole folder of these. https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/main/components/layout/f...But implementing a layout engine is doable. CSS is not magic; there's a spec that can be (meticulously) transformed into code. I've occasionally showed code like this to people frustrated that CSS seems arbitrary, just to show them that there is a logic to the execution environment. Granted, you're not going to regularly click into it the way you'd click into the implementation of a library, but it's no different from something like React in that regard. I think it helps!\n \nreply",
      "FWIW, Pavel, one of the authors, has devoted considerable time into what is one of the very, very few attempts at a formal specification for CSS (the static/float layout fragment cf [1]). It's a Racket program generating Z3 SMT solver code for verifying an instance layout (which also looks like Scheme) so it's not for the faint-hearted ;) but maybe just what an FP fan on HN is looking for as a challenge.[1]: https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/css-floats.html\n \nreply",

      "In that case, you've got at least one avid reader ;)\n \nreply",
      "Yes, layout is difficult, especially because (I think):1. The most \"core\" parts of layout, like CSS 2 stuff, is pretty poorly considered with a bunch of weird features that interact in strange ways. (Floats and clearance? Margin collapsing?) Some parts of this \"core\" were intended to be universal even though they're a bad fit for other layout modes. (Margin and padding, for example, don't have a clear purpose for say grid elements.)2. It's not well-modularized the way JS APIs are. A JS API can often be implemented fairly stand-alone, but each layout module interacts with every other layout module since they can be nested in various ways. I think newer specs like grid are trying to be stricter with this but there are fundamental challenges: the actual 2D screen is a shared resource that different layout modes must split up.\n \nreply",
      "Layout is so difficult that it made me quit using Common Lisp and ncurses to build my passion project and become the very thing I swore to destroy (a React developer).I can't be the only one who wants a simpler layout language than CSS that's designed with two decades of hindsight to provide the maximum simplicity-expressiveness product. Are there any serious projects to engineer something like this, or has everyone given up and either embraced CSS3 (waiting for the LLVM backend) or gone back to plain text?\n \nreply",
      "Author here, and I also teach web dev, including CSS, at the University of Utah (including this semester). Newer parts of CSS, like flex-box layout are both simple and powerful. Just use those! I think it's important to start thinking about learning all of the Web Platform like you'd think about learning all of the Windows APIs or all of the Linux system calls or all of your favorite programming language's features. People rarely do! (I have 15 years of Python experience, and I do not understand metaclasses or async.)

      "This is super cool! Recently, I've been musing about the potential ergonomics of programming directly with rich typography, and here Forscape's kind of gone and done it.The project seems to be specifically targeting working scientists, but I think there's real potential for using mathematical and math-like notation in a general programming language. The array language family does adopt a few of the affordances from math, and even that partial pick-up gives them some ergonomic features not seen elsewhere.At the moment, we're kind of stuck in the paradigm of linear input, only using very limited typography for somewhat dumb syntax highlighting. Math-like notation is really nice at conveying semantics and intent in ways that are really challenging in current languages. For example, sub- and superscripts effectively act as function parameters but give extra freedom for conveying the different meaning and use of said parameters. Things like Haskell's generic infix syntax, named parameters, optional arguments, etc. can be seen as ways of trying to work around current limitations.The biggest question for me is input, which Forscape seems to address quite nicely. We don't just want to typeset our code prettily, we want to have all the affordances of advanced typography directly available as we code.I'd love to hear user stories from Forscape: Do you like the mouse-oriented editor experience or do you prefer keyboard shortcuts? What is easiest for you to express in Forscape the language? What is most challenging? Where does the system diverge most from the natural expression? For those with a programming or CS background, how easy is it to reason about memory access and execution? Etc.Thanks for sharing!\n \nreply",

But that's changing. (Reuters: Loren Elliott)After years of setbacks, bad news and mounting obstacles, Australia's coal-fired generators must have felt they had something to celebrate.AGL, the giant energy company backed by tech billionaire and climate evangelist Mike Cannon-Brookes, revealed it had pulled off a first.At its huge Bayswater power station in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney, AGL successfully switched off an entire unit before switching it back on again just five hours later \u2013 a feat until recently considered unthinkable.In a post on social media, Bayswater general manager Len McLachlan said this process of \"two-shifting\" was a harbinger of the future.Throughout its history, coal-fired power had been considered the quintessential provider of so-call",

The internet is abuzz with technocrats and environmental gurus hailing this as an \"extraordinary experiment,\" as if flicking a light switch off and on were akin to splitting the atom. Commenters, ensconced in their armchairs, passionately debate the merits of nuclear power and coal's lifespan like they're unraveling the secrets of cold fusion, blissfully oblivious to the festering reality that we're still just setting stuff on fire to keep the lights on. Meanwhile, utilities play their age-old sleight-of-hand, greening their image while the coal quietly burns elsewhere\u2014innovation or deception? You decide. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd25"
