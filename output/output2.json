      "This is so cool! I do something similar for music - I have posters up for albums, and a small NFC tag is embedded behind the poster, so tapping my phone to the poster\u2019s corner and clicking the notification begins playing it immediately. I really want to make a collection of cassette-or-record-style plastic cards with album art and NFC tags, and hook it up to a speaker, so I can place my album on a pedestal and it starts playing immediately.\n \nreply",
      "This is great, I looked into doing something similar when my daughter was little. I didn't get very far and she learned how to use the remote control pretty quickly. I honestly think it was better for her to do it the 'old' way as she's pretty digitally savvy (for her age) than I would have expected.I remember when I was little I figured out how to use the VHS to set timers record shows etc, I think making things difficult is useful, it forces some learning to get a 'reward'.\n \nreply",
      "> I think making things difficult is useful, it forces some learning to get a 'reward'.I found the same growing up. But at the time (the 90s) there weren't hyperstimuli available in the form of smartphones, streaming services, or engagement-optimized algorithmic content feeds. The broadcast television that was available was often boring, or at least poorly matched to any given person's interests at a given time. We didn't have a game console at home either, so getting a game to work meant installing it on the family computer, and maybe troubleshooting problems myself.I don't know that I'd have learned as much as I did about computers at that age if such hyper-optimized things had been available to me as a kid. And I think their availability today proves that any notion of \"digital natives\" was a fallacy. The generation below me (Gen-Z, Zoomers?) seem to be experts at using touchscreen devices and social networks. Some of them are even flocking to text based AI games that seem intriguing. But they see computers largely as fixed appliances, and most give up pretty quickly when a computer malfunctions (whether it comes in the form of a phone, laptop, tablet, television, or something else).I now deliberately work to banish (and keep banished) as much of that algorithmically optimized hyperreality as possible out of my home and life. I feel much better without it, and always have. But I also think it's a good practice to get used to so that, if I ever have kids, it'll be the norm I pass on to their daily lives. Your first computer should require some assembly and tinkering, and digital activities which are really just skinner boxes created as lures by some or other corporation shouldn't be available to compete with more difficult, more rewarding pursuits.\n \nreply",
      "I unplugged the Alexa for about 6 months, that was a good reset, and we have a few tablets etc but no nonsense apps installed.Although time is ticking and I be we'll soon have the influence from 'peer pressure' - we're getting our daughter prepped for secondary/high school next year so she's got an old iPhone to play around with but thankfully she has zero interest in tech as a distraction. She sends a message to her friends every now and then, she watches some tutorials on Youtube for the piano, and of course some cat videos. My bigger worry is that she is going to bankrupt me from books... she's reading a new one every other week and has a real attachment to them so I can't persuade her to go to the local library...\n \nreply",
      "My cousin has had success with Apple Watches for her middle school aged kids. The Watches now function independently from phones IIRC and allow her kids to be \"reachable\" in the way that is now socially expected/enforced, but the screen is so small and the selection of \"apps\" so limited that they don't disrupt daily life with addictive software. However, you have to be in the Apple walled garden for that to work.As for books, I've fallen in love with my Kobo Clara ereader. It can run side-loaded software like Plato or KOReader, and I've loaded it with just about everything from https://standardebooks.org/. Maybe get your daughter an e-reader (Kobo or other model) for Christmas, paired with a monthly budget/stipend for books that she chooses how to spend?\n \nreply",

I knew that the hardware qualified it as a general purpose computer, and that it was locked down into being a more limited appliance. Features were added back over the years, and there's even an argument that we normalized much better security practices on both iOS and Android/AOSP because of that development cadence but, for most people whose first computer was a phone, the concept of a general purpose computer is simply missing from their awareness and \"computer\" becomes merely a word meaning black-box, magical appliance. And they don't discover what the appliance truly could be---its full potential---because it now works well enough for its specific purpose that they can leave the black box closed.It may be a historically inevitable closing of doors, in the same way that cars stopped being machines most people understood long before the advent of the microcomputer, but I feel a sense of loss for other people. My reading of human history is that when there's a rough technological parity (i.e. parity of understanding, access, and usefulness) between individuals and large institutions, you tend to see more freedom. When there isn't, you see less-to-none.\n \nreply",

      "I'm conflicted.It's absolutely stunning what smartphones can do these days and Apple makes an excellent product. It feels ungrateful and cynical to keep calling new models \"boring\".The reality though is that normie needs were accomplished several generations ago. I'll use my girlfriend as a sample of such user.She can't tell the difference between LCD and OLED nor would she notice Pro-motion.You can add a million features to the camera app but she opens it and presses the shutter. Her only awareness of features is when she accidentally enables one and doesn't know how to get back.You could set her back 8 iOS versions and she probably wouldn't notice. Because she uses none of the hundreds of features released since. Not because she dislikes them, she doesn't know they even exist.All the spectacular advances in computing power are lost on her as this makes zero difference for the Facebook cat video group and Pinterest.You might assume my girlfriend is perhaps lowly educated or just not tech savvy. Wrong, she's highly educated, even works in IT, although not in an engineering role. It's not that she's unable to understand the advances, she simply doesn't care.It's becoming ever harder to justify new models for normies. Pretty much they buy the new one when the battery of their current one runs bad, typically every 3-4 years.I think this is also why Apple put many Pro features into the regular model. Most people don't buy the pro and they're desperate for selling points in the regular model.If the iPhone would have true user-swappable batteries, their business would collapse.\n \nreply",
      "I don't know that I completely agree. To some degree, sure \u2014 most folks probably don't notice the year-to-year updates in e.g. computing power.But my 70yo mother, who is pretty far from being technologically savvy, uses continuity every day to copy one-time-use codes from her phone to her computer, even though she'd have no idea what the term \"continuity\" means in this context. She notices that it's easier to snap better pictures in more conditions than it was a few years back (and that pictures she receives are better looking on average, too). She uses 1Password with FaceID, which I set up for her, because it's so easy to just look at your phone to unlock that there's very little in the way of enabling and using that, and she doesn't need to write down passwords anymore.I think some of the magic of the Apple ecosystem is that you don't have to know about these things in order to use them. Someone shows you how to do something (Apple could certainly improve on the organic discoverability of many of these features! Some are impossible to find without looking), and then it often just works. And these things do keep getting closer to that ideal over time, with each generation. When I first started using continuity \u2014 long before my mother did \u2014 it definitely did not work all the time, and I persisted because I'm a techie early adopter. Eventually, though, it reached a state where once folks learn about it, they can just use it.I'm also not sure about the 3-4 year number, at least from personal experience, fwiw. We pass down phones in my family, and it easily takes 5-6 generations for them to reach the end of that chain and be in use for a year or two before they're switched out for the next model. Battery has never been the reason someone in that chain switched phones.\n \nreply",

      "I had no idea this was possible, but yeah, going to \u201cbattery health\u201d in my Settings shows battery health is degraded, and provides a link to schedule a replacement.\n \nreply",

Sure, there was always the SE option, but if I was buying a newer phone then it was going to be new one, damn it.What pushed the needle in the upgrade vs repair decision for me was wear concerns on the nand flash.  I've encountered plenty of stories of flash failures after the 4th, 3rd or even 2nd battery replacement. I never found a way to get a meaningful health check for iphone flash lifetime but I really didn't want to find out the hard way.That was in addition to 5G vs LTE.

      "Love this project. I just moved from Toronto, and compared to the US was frustrated by how every major industry in Canada was basically an oligopoly.In Canada if you look at telecoms, banks, insurance, grocers, airlines, etc \u2013 there are a few major competitors and that's about it. It's very difficult to start a competitor, often for regulatory reasons, and most smaller competitors end up getting bought out by the big guys.As a result, they have crazy shitty experiences. Telecoms are frustratingly expensive for cable and mobile services. Banks are dreadful and charge fees left and right, for basic things that are free in the US. Customer support with any of these companies is terrible.I'm not surprised that they are colluding on pricing. It's quite obvious in the telecom market at least.It seems tricky from the gov's perspective because this oligopoly/collusion behavior likely fuels higher GDP and more tax revenue... but ultimately more competition and consumer protection would make for a better country to live in.\n \nreply",
      "Canada is intentionally setup to produce oligopolies as a defense against large American companies:\"Canada was, in a lot of ways, built on monopolies \u2014 think about the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company or Canadian Pacific Rail. Canada has always feared that if we don\u2019t let our homegrown companies get huge, we\u2019ll get swamped by American competitors. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a tension between Canadian politicians, who often say they\u2019re pro-competition, and the law, which incentivizes consolidation.\"I think this strategy work well-enough until about 20 years ago. And by well enough I mean Canadian consumers weren't in an ideal situation, but things were good enough for most Canadians. Now the oligopolies have become basically predatory, gobbling up goverment funds and market capture wherever possible.Case in point: our Temporary Foreign Worker program (who now make up 7% of the Canadian population) have not only strained housing, healthcare, and the job market it has even been called a \"breeding ground for slavery\" by the U.N.

This includes much of the mainstream media, in addition to the overtly government-controlled services (education, health care, policing, etc.), and government itself (politicians, bureaucrats, etc.). These people have no incentive for positive change, and actually a lot of incentive for things to get much worse than they already are.I think it'll be a mix of economic and demographic factors that eventually result in change, rather than technological factors.Decades of awful immigration policies have created a society in Canada that's now extremely fractured, well beyond the traditional (and mild in comparison) English/French divide that has already caused enough problems in the past.Eventually, the already-severe economic inefficiency imposed by government will become unsustainable, and economic troubles will result in \"Balkanization\" occurring. It will be particularly bad in parts of Ontario and BC, where we already see this beginning to happen.\n \nreply"

      "In my experience, trying to switch VFX companies from CPU-based rendering to GPU-based rendering 10+ years ago, a 2-5x performance improvement wasn't enough. We even provided a compatible renderer that accepted Renderman files and generated matching images. Given the rate of improvement of standard hardware (CPUs in our case, and GPU-based inference in yours), a 2-5x improvement will only last a few years, and the effort to get there is large (even larger in your case). Plus, I doubt you'll be able to get your HW everywhere (i.e. mobile) where inference is important, which means they'll need to support their existing and your new SW stack. The other issue is entirely non-technical, and may be an even bigger blocker -- switching the infrastructure of a major LLM provider to a new upstart is just plain risky. If you do a fantastic job, though, you should get aquahired, probably with a small individual bonus, not enough to pay off your investors.\n \nreply",
      "We're targeting the edge market first, such as NVIDIA's Jetson line, because it's far less supported/focussed on. In our experience, whenever we did training runs on H100 clusters with x86, any pip package would be easily installable, and a wide array of software just worked. This is not the case in Jetson, where we constantly have to rebuild packages from source, and in general, NVIDIA will only release a better board every five years. As for the second part of your question, we agree. Much of our work has been trying to make switching to our software layer straightforward (a single line of code). The ideal endgame is that, given an ONNX file, we can parse the generated node tree and determine if our hardware supports all the nodes. Of course, this is assuming we have a large enough share of the market using our software, so we know what operations we need to support on the hardware side of things.\n \nreply",
      "I cannot see any way of building HW profitably for the Jetson market. You are really competing with Raspberry PI, not Jetson, IMO. I mean, I'm no expert, but I would suggest doing a deep dive on your business plan if you intend to target the small hardware world rather than spending any time designing HW or SW. Then reduce your estimate by at least half since doing anything in that embedded/edge world has many more technical issues.\n \nreply",
      "In general, Jetson has quite a large market. Vehicle companies use automotive-rated Jetson Orins, and defense companies also use Jetson Orins to power ML applications on the edge (Anduril). Many of the companies we currently talk to are robotics companies that are forced to use Jetsons because they are both the least of the bad options and the only edge compute provider with enough juice to run larger transformer models.\n \nreply",
      "And the auto and Defense markets are so easy to enter! /sBoth of these markets have long lead times, tight HW build times, and move incredibly slowly. They are not the kind of markets that like using stuff from new companies with no history. Again, I'm no expert, but I'd say you need to be concentrating on sales and market research now.\n \nreply",
      "With respect it doesn't sound like you know much about any of these businesses. This startup is extremely early, the road to silicon is long, and there is a lot of external change and learning by doing that will happen between here and there. This is them getting started and based on my related work experience I think it's pretty interesting.\n \nreply",
      "We are not under the illusion these markets are easy to enter. Still, we believe providing an effortless and compatible experience for edge ML computing is a strong competitive advantage. We have not met anyone who likes using Jetsons yet, unlike A100/H100s in the server market.Edit: I should note that if it weren't for Dusty and his docker image generating GitHub repo for Jetson, we would have spent weeks trying to get our kernels and optimized models shipped to customers.\n \nreply",

      "I realized after a few years of doing it that my strategy for keeping Wikis useful is to treat them as B-Trees.When the landing page gets too full/too many outgoing links, I start pushing links and paragraphs down into the child pages, to leave space for a fair share of timely links and on-boarding docs.Similar and older links get pushed down into the sibling that best represents the topic. Then if the destination page is now too big, similar and older links get pushed down to their children.  Eventually all of the outdated docs are three levels down from the landing page, where only historians and experts will see them. And sometimes as we finally decide how part of the system really should work, siblings get combined into one page, minus the speculative work that gets pushed down deeper in the tree. It works remarkably well. At the end of the day documentation is a search problem.I highly recommend it for a Friday afternoon exercise when you want to be productive but you know starting a new task is a complete waste of time.\n \nreply",

LSM trees were an orders of magnitude faster at 100K edges, so BDB had shown that B-trees are no match there.B-trees are semi-static data structures, they are hard to rebuild incrementally if data is random.

      "Reconsider your assumption. Why does ransomware work? It's because the same people who have habits and/or systems that make compromise of them possible and likely are also given full write and delete access as well as, of course, read access.What would a ransomware attack look like if the same kind of employee who downloads bootleg versions of PDF editors was only given read access to the files they need and write access to only their own files?

I know web developers get a lot of hate, and I'm not trying to perpetuate that (especially going on almost 20 years as one), but I do think the ease of getting into web development is a contributing factor to the surprise most of us have at issues like this. In general, I think most web developers don't really know what they are doing, as they try to just get up and running without even knowing to think about security. It seems like a fake it until you make it type of industry, compared to other types of development. I try to keep up in other areas of development, and understand that security isn't something to be bolted on at a later stage of development, but I also started my professional career learning network administration and security before I ever started web development. Lots of developers get their application working, are too afraid to start looking into what they could improve, and that includes looking into security.

      "They need to crack down on companies that ruin hardware (or will one day ruin hardware) when they shut off their last cloud server.There's no excuse for an appliance to brick itself or lose functionality just because of the manufacturer's remote action. When I buy a device, I don't want a perpetual, tethered relationship with the manufacturer in order to work the device. I don't want it to ask the manufacturer for permission to run every day. I don't want it to be dependent on the manufacturer to keep it alive. I don't want to create an account. I don't want to log in to the manufacturer's servers. I don't want them to know my IP address or my home address. Leave me alone, I'm just not that into you!A hardware device should work on day 10,000 just as it worked on day 1. If you as a company can't do that, you should not be able to sell the device (EDIT: OR at least you should be required to prominently mark the devices as \"dependent on the manufacturer's servers\")\n \nreply",
      "> OR at least you should be required to prominently mark the devices as \"dependent on the manufacturer's servers\"Right next to the prominent label about causing cancer in the state of California, presumably.I feel a notice wouldn't work here because the average consumer wouldn't understand the implications of depending on the manufacturer's servers or what it even means, plus every smart doorbell or whatever would just include it so it's not like it'd affect any consumer's choice\n \nreply",
      "What we really need are a variety of certifications enforced by the FTC, not blanket regulation.  Like you can put a sticker on your product, which would be illegal for non-complying products to have.  One seal could be for Open Source, another for Cloud-Free, Firmware Rollbacks, Telemetry-Free, E2EE, 10 years of replacement parts, etc.It's clear just from this thread that different people care about different things.  And I'd rather see a certification that never gets used, than a whole kind of product removed from the market because the FTC got it wrong, and now it doesn't make sense to produce it.\n \nreply",
      "Without regulation, I'd be afraid that it would simply become impossible to find a product that doesn't have customer hostile features. Companies don't need to fear lacking stickers if their competitors lack them as well (or if they don't have viable competitors).\n \nreply",
      "Why would someone not just start a competitor to take advantage of the market vacuum?  If consumers desire something, have a means to tell if they're getting it, and are willing to pay for it, the market is remarkably good at providing.\n \nreply",
      "The idea of free market being \"remarkably good at providing\" things is completely conditional on the very specific properties of that specific market. Via your logic, monopolies would never exist, nor would anti competitive business practices, and yet they do, because the first thing companies do in a free market is do their best to make it unfree where possible as it's more profitable that way.The only way to solve this problem is to regulate markets that become unfree where observed to be necessary to do so.\n \nreply",
      "Sure it is, but manufactured goods is one of those markets that has generally proven to have relatively low barriers to entry and lots of competition.  That's why first the Japanese, then Chinese, now Southeast Asians have been so successful at displacing American and British incumbents.  There's no natural monopoly there, no real consumer lock-in once people write off their bricked-by-software paperweights, and the technological expertise is spread fairly widely across a hundreds of thousands of skilled professionals.  You do have economies of scale and pretty large capital costs, but capital is not that hard to come by.You don't need regulation to fix this, you need startups to go compete with the entrenched firms that are bricking their customers' devices.\n \nreply",
      "That just throws the burden back on consumers. Many products already come festooned with stickers or logos printed on packaging, and most of them are little more than flair. I can also politicians demanding to know why taxpayers' hard-earned money is going to promote products that are 'anti-innovation' (telemetry-free) or 'support criminality' (E2EE).\n \nreply",
      "Good idea! Like a nutritional label for electronics. The FDA is very strict about nutritional labels, as they should be.\n \nreply",
      "missing the /sThose labels don't mean much because companies have really worked around and lobbied to make it all a very murky label.\"Organic\" labels, for instance, don't mean they haven't used pesticides or other harmful things \u2013 just a certain list of them.\n \nreply"

In response, the chorus of comment warriors debate with the ferocity of a Black Friday queue, oscillating between calls for anarchist sticker-based interventions and bemoaning the free market's failure to magically solve consumer woes. No consensus is reached, but all agree: if only their devices worked as well as their passion for complaining online."

      "The original suffered from an underpowered CPU and a high price, along with a fit and finish that looked great but compared favorably to 20 year old PowerBooks more than modern computers (even \"thick\" laptops today were much thinner).Seeing this one become quite a bit thinner, using an Arm CPU (RK3588) that is about as good as it gets outside Snapdragon / Apple M in terms of efficiency... I think price may be the major turn-off, as I'm assuming it still won't hit under $1k fully built.But if they could hit that number, more people would be willing to take a small hit in performance/compatibility to have a fully open design laptop.\n \nreply",

      "There were trackballs on phones at one time.. of course, the ball has to be smaller, but it's very much doable.I'd actually expect a larger trackball to be harder to do well, it has to be sunken in to allow closing the lid, and that sounds unpleasant to use.\n \nreply",
      "Game controllers have really nice joysticks. I wish one (or two) of them were available next to regular keys, maybe instead of the trackpad.Further, I'd like a split layout option for the keyboard, for the relaxed position oh the wrists, and better use of thumbs.\n \nreply",

Promising the *freedom* to swap modules like it's a Frankenstein's Play-Doh set, this device caters perfectly to the three people left on the planet who still print their own keyboard keys. Commenters compound their delusions by celebrating its slightly slimmer design, while lamenting the tragic omission of a trackball\u2014yes, a trackball in 2023. Between sobbing over the loss of yesteryear's input device and planning how to customize their laptop to also toast bread, the enthusiastic cries of \"take my money\" complete the tragicomedy of outdated desires meshing with wallet-draining reality."
