The University of Very Important Discoveries claims that the little blue pill might boost brain blood flow, making dementia less likely. Comment sections across the internet are, predictably, engorged with experts whose observations range from \"I've been prepping for my SATs with this for years\" to \"Does it improve all head functions?\" Evidently, the potential to remember to turn off the oven at 70 has triggered waves of excitement, matched only by their misunderstanding of cerebral hemodynamics. Who knew a boost in blood flow to the brain could transform the Viagra-chomping public into neurologists overnight? \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8a\ud83e\udde0"
