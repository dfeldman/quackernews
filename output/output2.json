      "This is genuinely a good waltz.Sometimes, they will discover a lost piece by some known composer, and the media will pick it up. But imo, when you have a listen, it often turns out that the piece had been lost for a reason.What makes this waltz remarkable as a new discovery, in my opinion, is that it is more or less a finished work; the composition is so distinctively a work by Chopin; and the work brings something novel to the oeuvre.\u2014\u2014As for the debut, I think someone involved could have been more thoughtful. It feels as if some people in NYC saw a chance to be the first to debut, and they ran with it. It was published in the NYTimes, with a New York-based pianist, with New York\u2019s \u201cSteinway Hall,\u201d which reads like a product placement. Chopin wrote these intimate pieces for the acoustics of small, intimate settings, and for nothing like a modern Steinway concert grand piano.Maybe they could have instead worked with some local cultural organization in Poland, which could have made the debut a significant local cultural thing? Maybe taking the chance to promote an early-career pianist from Chopin\u2019s homeland, rather than the career of a world-famous New Yorker?\n \nreply",

I assume that powering a sufficiently powerful fridge is not an option, given the origin of the theoretical limit, but I can't quite point out why it wouldn't work.Secondly it assumes that an unsuccessful attempt must flip at least some bits in an semi-permanent manner. This is obviously true of all current computers, but doesn't have to be true for all possible apparatuses. A specialized hyper-efficient password cracking system should be expected to get below this limit. Will we ever build one? Who knows.Arguably this latter 'loop-hole' is just pointing out that quantum computers or more efficient algorithms could do better, so maybe we should absorb it into the definition of 'brute-force'.\n \nreply",

But unless you think true randomness is impossible, and also that all possible sources of pseudo-random input on Earth come from terrestrial sources and not, say, incoming cosmic radiation, then knowing the size of the \"Earth\" system is no constraint at all. A heuristic for focusing your search, maybe, if you think the password is likely to be something easily memorable for a human, but that's nothing to do with the size of the system, just commonly-transmitted information there.The phrase \"stored on Earth\" is a red herring. You don't need to store all possible passwords for those passwords to be possible to generate here.

      "The review distills the book's view of the difference between pure mathematics and applied mathematics. \"applied\" split from \"pure\" to meet the technical needs of the US military during WW2.My best example of the split is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_of_second_derivatives\nWikpedia notes that \"The list of unsuccessful proposed proofs started with Euler's, published in 1740,[3] although already in 1721 Bernoulli had implicitly assumed the result with no formal justification.\" The split between pure (Euler) and applied(Bernoulli) is already there.The result is hard to prove because it isn't actually true. A simple proof will apply to a counter example, so cannot be correct. A correct proof will have to use the additional hypotheses needed to block the counter examples, so cannot be simple.Since the human life span is 70 years, I face an urgent dilemma. Do I master the technique needed to understand the proof (fun) or do I crack on and build things (satisfaction)? Pure mathematicians are planning on constructing long and intricate chains of reasoning; a small error can get amplified into a error that matters. From a contradiction one can prove anything. Applied mathematics gets applied to engineering; build a prototype and discover problems with tolerances, material impurities, and annoying edge cases in the mathematical analysis. A error will likely show up in the prototype. Pure? Applied? It is really about the ticking of the clock.\n \nreply",

And I think that points to how to resolve the dilemma you point out between pure and applied: we soon will not have to decide between pure and applied mathematics. Designing (\u2248 applied math) will be done the most efficient way by finding and using the right abstractions (\u2248 pure math).\n \nreply",

Differentiation is messy in real analysis because it's messy in numerical computing. How real analysis fixes this mess parallels how numerical computing has to fix the mess.Remember that differentiation - unlike integration - is uncomputable. Fixing this requires theories that make differentiation computable. Your options are: Distribution theory (which should be implicit in any numerical algorithm that solves linear PDEs); or complex analysis (which makes differentiation reducible to integration, where the latter is of course computable); or continuity of derivatives (because all computable functions are continuous). Note that the last of these - mere continuity, which is a necessary and practically sufficient condition for a function to be computable - is the most general. It turns out that these are precisely the conditions that make the expected identity hold.Lesson? Simply assume all your functions are continuous.\n \nreply",

      "If this seems oddly familiar, you may actually have read it before, and no plagiarism is involved. Moser wrote the beginning of this article in the middle of his classic essay, \u201dWhy Chinese is So Damn Hard\u201d https://pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html> Can you imagine a well-educated native English speaker totally forgetting how to write a word like \"knee\" or \"tin can\"? Or even a rarely-seen word like \"scabbard\" or \"ragamuffin\"? I was once at a luncheon with three Ph.D. students in the Chinese Department at Peking University, all native Chinese (one from Hong Kong). I happened to have a cold that day, and was trying to write a brief note to a friend canceling an appointment that day. I found that I couldn't remember how to write the character \u5694, as in da penti \u6253\u55b7\u5694 \"to sneeze\". I asked my three friends how to write the character, and to my surprise, all three of them simply shrugged in sheepish embarrassment. Not one of them could correctly produce the character. Now, Peking University is usually considered the \"Harvard of China\". Can you imagine three Ph.D. students in English at Harvard forgetting how to write the English word \"sneeze\"??This page is from 02004: http://web.archive.org/web/20040811151534/http://pinyin.info....  Possibly the rest of the article is not simply an excerpt from it.\n \nreply",

I sometimes get that behavior from Chinese and Japanese colleagues when I am supposed to know something but temporarily forgot it (or just cannot access it at the time).\n \nreply",

      "The fact that \u5694/sneeze is usually the go to example means it ends up becoming the exception that proves the rule. Most other characters are much more easily remembered.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, this particular character seems to cause people problems because it\u2019s not really used anywhere else.\n \nreply",
      "No, they really  just forgot the characters. I lived in Japan for the better part of a decade and it isn't at all uncommon. There were many times when I explicitly asked natives to recognize or help me with a Kanji and they struggled as well. I doubt everyone's been systematically lying when you genuinely ask for help.The reason is just digital input really. Pinyin and Romaji typing have become so common that a lot of people write  Hanzi/Kanji by hand less and less and it's so complicated of a skill there's really no other way to get it in your brain other than practice. I even notice it myself, I easily recognize 10x more characters than I can accurately write.\n \nreply",
      "That\u2019s a pretty good point\u2026 if I saw \u2018three Ph.D. students in English at Harvard\u2019 forget how to write \u2018sneeze\u2019, I would assume they were lunatics pretending, not that they genuinely forgot how to write the word.Does that imply learning the advanced literary culture, that is usually associated with prestige academia, has a vastly higher threshold in Chinese than in English?It\u2019s pretty disturbing for language itself to be a potentially retarding force on learning.\n \nreply",
      "As a relatively well-educated Japanese native speaker, I too experience this problem when writing Japanese on paper - being unable to write many kanji characters by hand. I am no exception among Japanese native speakers. While the author seems to interpret this problem as something crucial, I question whether it truly is.The orthography of Mandarin and Japanese includes an alphabet consisting of thousands of characters, the majority of which comprise dozens of strokes. Although East Asian people have higher IQ scores on average, we are not superhuman - our memory capacity is bound by human limits, and the decreased frequency of actually writing kanji on paper has naturally resulted in our forgetting how to write many of them. Is this surprising?Furthermore, orthography is not part of language in a fundamental sense - it's merely a useful tool that accompanies a language. Therefore, I do not see the writing system becoming less stable as a significant issue. Consider Korea as an example: they used to use kanji in their orthography but have almost completely eliminated it with virtually no adverse effects. While laypeople often assume orthography is an integral part of a language, this is just not the case from the linguistic perspective.\n \nreply",
      "I'm studying Japanese at the moment and what struck me is how important context is, particularly in reading. You need to know where to read 1-3 letters ahead to read a word and interpret it. That's not really a thing in English - a word is a word, and the individual letters that it's composed of are almost always pronounced the same way.I think digital is a big crutch for Japanese/Chinese because you have input methods that help you write what you want to say, so you don't actually need to remember how to write kanji as much in daily life.\n \nreply",
      "> You need to know where to read 1-3 letters ahead to read a word and interpret it. That's not really a thing in EnglishIt happens in a English too, where you see a chunk of letters and mis-predict which word they represent in a way which affects its meaning [0], and sometimes that will also affect pronunciation. [1]An example from the link:> \"The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.\"A reader linearly scanning along doesn't know whether \"complex\" is an adjective or a noun, and then whether \"houses\" is a noun or a verb. I'm pretty sure all human languages have similar problems where a certain amount of look-ahead or backtracking is necessary.For another example to highlight pronunciation changes, consider the ambiguity of:\"I saw the rhino live in the zoo.\"That could mean that the rhino was doing the verb of living, in which it rhymes with \"give\", or it could also mean that the speaker was seeing it in-person, in which case it rhymes with \"drive\".[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_(linguistics)\n \nreply"

      "I did some experiments around this idea a few years ago, partly inspired by the \"35% Faster Than The Filesystem\" article: https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.htmlHere are the notes I made at the time: https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/30/fun-binary-data-and-sq...I built https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-media as a plugin for serving static files from SQLite via Datasette and it works fine, but honestly I've not used it much since I built it.A related concept is using SQLite to serve map tiles - this plugin https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-tiles does that, using the MBTiles format which it turns out is a SQLite database full of PNGs.If you want to experiment with SQLite to serve files you may find my \"sqlite-utils insert-files\" CLI tool useful for bootstrapping the database: https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserti...\n \nreply",
      "In terms of performance, the content hash based file name approach is easier to implement with SQLite storage. The content hash has to be generated just once during file upload, not every time the web server is restarted (or using a build step which does actual file renames). It is possible to do it dynamically for file system files (see https://github.com/benbjohnson/hashfs for a embedFS implementation), but the database makes it a bit easier.\n \nreply",
      "This is pretty cool, but if you're rewriting resource names server side then you need some machinery to rewrite references to those resources. I see the example you linked shows the root HTML being generated server-side from a template so content hash names can be injected into the template. Looks reasonable. Not so great for dealing with things like `import` calls in javascript (for deferred loading of script modules), if those need to be rewritten as well.Your JS bundler (if you use one!) might be effectively rewriting imports anyway so it can be convenient to do the content-hash-named-files rewrites in the same place. But not everyone wants to use a bundler for that.\n \nreply",
      "Clace can be used to build hypermedia driven UI's, using Go templates and HTMX. https://clace.io/docs/develop/templates/#static-function gives the content hashed file name, the templates have to use that function. See https://github.com/claceio/apps/blob/f5566cea6061ec85ea59495... for an example, that game is running live at https://cowbull.co/Clace can also run containers, where the UI is served by the container. For example, Streamlit/Gradio based apps. In that case, Clace acts like an app server and reverse proxy to the container, no file name rewrites are done.Clace includes esbuild for being able to import npm packages as ES modules https://clace.io/docs/develop/javascript/. There is no support for any JS bundling.\n \nreply",
      "Using sqlite keeps a persistent open database connection, so you only have to send requests for content that sqlite has probably cached. When reading static files, you open, read, and close a file with every request, meaning more context switches, even though the filesystem layer will have cached the file content. If you want to speed this up, the appropriate solution is to add a caching front-end, not to turn everything into a database. It will be faster than using sqlite and easier to maintain and troubleshoot.\n \nreply",
      "Well you can store metadata in SQLite. You can update metadata and files in a transaction. It already has a caching layer built in (I think 8mb by default, that might need some tuning for this use case). It is thread safe (I mean it is a giant rw mutex but whatever) Does not sound that bad to just use it instead of building a caching layer that might be marginally faster than sqlite. And if you restart your caching frontend thing, it will need to rebuild the cache using tons of syscalls. SQLite cache will fill up easier as it has less context switches.One major downside I see would be backing up the database. You can do granular backups on a filesytem. Even rsync would work fine. You\u2019d need to basically snapshot the entire thing here.\n \nreply",
      "Isn't anything that avoids too many syscalls and copying between userspace and kernel 35% faster?  Including filesystems that run completely on user space (not FUSE, FUSE calls go trough kernel)\n \nreply",

      "> Transactional Updates : This is the main benefit. Updating multiple files can be done in one transaction. Isolation ensures that there are no broken webapps during the update.Your server on its own, whether it uses SQLite or the filesystem, cannot save you from having broken webapps during an update. Each page in the browser is a _tree_ of resources, which are fetched with separate HTTP requests and therefore not subject to your server-side transaction/atomic update system. You can change all resources transactionally on the server side but the browser can still observe a combination of old and new resources.The common solution here is to ensure that all sub-resources of a page (javascript bundle(s), stylesheet(s), media, etc) are named (ie, in the URL) using a content hash or version. All resources (from the root HTML document down) need to refer to the specific content-hash or versioned name, so that if the browser loads version X of the root HTML document then it will load the _corresponding version_ of all sub-resources. Not only that, but if you're updating a page from version X to version Y, all the version-X sub-resources need to remain available after you start serving page version Y, until you're confident that no browser could reasonably be still loading version X of the page, otherwise you can break page version X while someone is still loading it.This means you actually specifically don't want to put sub-resources for a page into one atomically-switched-out bundle along with the root HTML document, because if you do that you'll be removing the previous versions of sub-resources while they may still be referenced.Also of course in some cases there might be some sub-resources (e.g., perhaps some media files) that you want to be versioned \"separately\" from the HTML document that contains them, so that you can update them without busting caches for all of the page/app structural elements like your javascript blobs and stylesheets and so on, and you _might_ need to take that into account in your page build system as well.\n \nreply",

Clace provides functionality usually handled separately by a web server and an application server. When the development of Clace was started last year, one of the first decisions was how to store the application data (files) and metadata. The app metadata obviously made sense to store in a database, since apps are created dynamically. The app data (static files, app code, config files etc) is usually stored on the file system by most web servers.For Clace, the decision was made to use SQLite for app files storage instead of using the file system. The reasoning was mainly to be able to do atomic version changes. When updating an app, since there could be lots of files being updated, using a database would allow all changes to be done atomically in a transaction. This would prevent broken web pages from being served during a version change.Clace uploads all files to the SQLite database during app creation",

      "A particular problem with Wikipedia is the by definition one-sided view of charged issues. In a single language like Vietnamese, where the majority of native speakers locate in a single country with heavy censorship and brainwashed by propaganda, articles about social, political matters and people can be very one-sided and certainly can not be up to the standard of an encyclopedia. Change is extremely difficult due to  the long term moderators, who obviously have agendas.In such situations, an alternative version/server might be a solution. For example, a social.vn.wiki could specialize in alternative views on socio-political issues in Vietnamese and be moderated differently.  I can imagine new Wikipedia hubs where content changes are monitored by AI to detect manipulation attempts and obviously false content. I also can imagine a new Wikipedia, where the reader can up vote/down vote an article instead of actively change it. For heavy moderated contents, this could be a better alternative to a edit war.I'm not sure that federations can solve this problem because of their inherent dynamics.

      "> we can\u2019t read out of the corner of our eyes, no matter how hard we tryThis is not quite true. Reading via peripheral vision is a skill, but most people never have the right kind of motivation (and perhaps not the right kind of visual stimulus) to learn it. I know this because I have personally known someone who read exclusively via her peripheral vision.There's an inherited retinal disease that runs in my family. It's a form of 'cone-rod dystrophy'. Cone-rod dystrophies are diseases where the cones and the rods in the eye eventually stop responding to light. The order of the terms in the naming reflects the typical order of the dystrophy: first the cones (responsible for central vision) go, then the rods (responsible for peripheral vision) go, too. As the cones and rods go bad, this results in loss of visual acuity in central and peripheral vision respectively. (It often causes lots of other, less generic problems, too, such as: blind spots, warping/twisting distortions in the visual field, sometimes flickering artifacts, progressive colorblindness, extreme light sensitivity, and an effective reduction of contrast.)Between individual cases, there's a lot of variation in how the disease presents. There's no fixed timeline or ordering for the progression (even though the disease's genetic cause has been identified as just a single gene!).Anyhow, in my late aunt's case, her central vision was useless long before her peripheral vision could give out. So she learned, somehow, to do things like read her smartphone using only her peripheral vision.We chatted about it once or twice. Onlookers often could not comprehend that she was looking at her phone, since her eyes weren't pointed towards it. She once laughed to me about how someone had asked her 'Why are you sniffing your phone?', while she held it up to her face to read a text message.My impression is that learning to rely on your peripheral vision in this way is extremely counter-intuitive and difficult to do. (This may have something to do with the mechanisms discussed in TFA.) I wonder if it can even be done at all without first obscuring one's central vision (which I guess you could do artificially with contacts). But evidently it can be done.\n \nreply",
      "It makes me think of a common trick in stargazing that is to look at stars with peripheral vision. Fixating them will make them disappear.That's because the fovea, the \"high resolution\" part of the eye we use when focusing on some point is entirely made of cone cells, which give you color vision, but are less sensitive, as opposed to rod cells, that make up most of the peripheral vision. In other words, peripheral vision is better in low light situations.\n \nreply",

      "I guess what the article means is that it's not possible to read with peripheral vision except with very large font size and up close. Was your aunt able to read normal print besides titles? Also, I just tried out of curiosity. I must imagine only her fovea was unusable, and the area just around it (I think it's like 5\u00b0 off-axis) was still fine, because I think I have pretty good peripheral vision, and I can't make out anything if I intentionally look away from what I'm trying to read. Certainly not on a phone; I have to get it so close to my face that it goes out of focus.By the way, while it is true that cones are far more densely packed in the fovea, their function is color vision, not central vision. Rods are responsible for motion perception and vision in low-light environments.\n \nreply",
      "> except with very large font size and up closeYeah, it's hard to say what the determinative factors were because her general visual acuity was so low that she generally needed very large fonts very up close anyway. My mom and my sister and I also have this condition and rely on magnification to varying degrees (and for various reasons\u2014 sometimes it's truly about acuity but sometimes larger sizes/bolder fonts are a clumsy way to try to make up for contrast issues). But even those of us with usable central vision generally need large fonts anyway. We're also all, for reasons I think are mostly incidental, naturally myopic (although my mom is no longer nearsighted but farsighted (with low acuity\u2014 she's legally blind)).> Was your aunt able to read normal print besides titles?No. Even titles, like titles of chapters in a paperback, she could likely only read with magnification. And that's if she could get enough contrast at all. At some point, screens become much easier to read than paper, even at equal sizes.I should learn more about the precise anatomy because it's interesting, but currently I know more about the subjectivity of it than the mechanics.> By the way, while it is true that cones are far more densely packed in the fovea, their function is color vision, not central vision. Rods are responsible for motion perception and vision in low-light environments.There may be other factors in these inherited retinal dystrophies that affect the way their progressions affect field of view, idk. But what I said about which areas are first distorted for cone-rod dystrophies is true, and its reverse is true for rod-cone dystrophies (i.e., retinitis pigmentosa), where people with that condition lose their peripheral vision first and their field of view shrinks from the outside-in. My assumption so far has been that this corresponds to those density differences you mentioned.> Rods are responsible for motion perception and vision in low-light environments.I do know that much. :)One of the features of this illness that's very prevalent for me and my sister right now is extreme light sensitivity, presumably because our eyes rely increasingly on their rods even during the daytime and even in high-light environments. One related I've written about on HN before is how the need for lower total light emission pushes both of us to high-contrast dark themes with the lowest brightness possible. OLED screens are really nice when your rods are in better shape than your cones!One that I don't think I have is that my colorblindness has been getting worse over time. The last time I took a colorblindness test (administered by a medical professional, at my retinal specialist's office), I could hardly read any of the Ishihara plates at all. (When the doctor came in, he asked me if I only saw in black-and-white, which I found mildly irksome but very amusing. I laughed about it with my family afterwards. I do still see many colors! I just have trouble distinguishing a lot of them, too.) My sister, who was not colorblind at all when she was growing up, is now also colorblind, about as much as me based on her tests.\n \nreply",

      "> This isn't reproducible by removing the battery entirely, either. If you take it out, the clock loses all ability to function and just resets constantly. So having a mostly drained battery seems to be doing a little work so that it resets once but then resumes normal functioning (until the next time it tries to go off).I think what this really suggests is that the transformer and power supply are providing multiple voltages. The +9V rail is broken, but the other rail (maybe +5V) for the LED display is fine.So the alarm chip and the alarm sounder is running only from the 9V battery. If the battery is weak, then the sudden power demand from sounding the alarm is too much, the voltage dips and the chip resets.\n \nreply",

The +9V rail is broken, but the other rail (maybe +5V) for the LED display is fine.There's a reference design in the LM8560N IC PDF that suggests that the additional secondary winding is only used to drive the display, and all other electronics is powered off the main rail.The 10V cap is kaput and it can't filter the input power, 9V just acts as a filter (even a discharged one). The OP should replace the cap with a 16V one, because a 10V cap on a 9V rail just isn't right..\n \nreply",
      "Older wall clocks used synchronous motors which would literally move the second hand using the waveform from the A/C power. As loads on generators went up, the effective RPMs went down, causing downstream power to run at slightly slower than 60Hz.

      "I have used dedicated alarm clocks until the death of my parents, and then I have retired the clocks. One of them was a Sony clock/radio that might have been similar to yours, which I had given to my mother because it had very big digits, so she could see the time clearly from a long distance.Another alarm clock had been built by my father, some 50 years ago, from medium-scale integration TTL circuits, before the apparition of dedicated integrated circuits for clocks. It still worked perfectly, and because it used a thermo-compensated quartz oscillator it had a much higher accuracy than the cheap quartz clocks or watches that can be bought now.Since then, whenever I need an alarm or to know the time, I just use a smartphone or computer. I was born much earlier, so I have used dedicated alarm clocks for several decades, but I do not like to use superfluous things, so I no longer use dedicated alarm clocks (or wrist watches or TV sets etc.).That does not mean that I do not like clocks, either mechanical or electronic.

It is one (of many) \"Sony Dream Machine\" models, but most don't have this feature. The front has two big dials side by side. The left one has 24 marked positions, for each of the 24 hours in the day, color-coded for day and night. the other on the right has 12 positions for the 60 minutes in 5 minute increments.
