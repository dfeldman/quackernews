We\u2019re incredibly small in size and mental capacity.In ways the bacteria on the dust are oblivious to the scale and nature of the world around them, we seem similarly lost and hopeless in the pursuit of comprehending the universe. We just weren\u2019t built to grasp this kind of scale. We can enjoy images of the tiniest little slices of it, though. I\u2019m actually very grateful for that. I think it\u2019ll be a source of endless wonder for my entire life.",

One genius pointed out the perplexing physics of ice behaving badly at its glass transition temperature like some sort of Victorian fainting couch, while another likened the project to \"chindogu\", the art of inventing utterly useless things, thus giving us a wonderful new term to describe most internet comments. In a chilling twist of irony, the conversation then devolved into a DIY discussion on pykrete-making, because if history has taught us anything, it's that nothing brings people together like the shared dream of building an unmeltable iceberg."

      "> This was my first time soldering DFN packages and they\u2019re tiny! Because I don\u2019t have a microscope or anything to visually inspect my soldering and these components were mostly just handling power anyway I just checked for shorts between power and ground and tried to take close-ups using my phone to see if I could spot any shorts. The technique that ended up working well for me to solder on these DFN packages without a stencil is to put what can only be described as way too much solder paste on the pads and then pushing the IC in the pool of solder, when the solder melts from the heat of my hot air station the IC will float on top and then I push down on it with tweezers and all excess solder will squeeze out and bead up, hopefully landing somewhere on the solder mask, where I can pick it up later once it\u2019s solid.This is positively an insane methodology for soldering. Fun, but insane.I actually can imagine that it works, strangely enough. But I don't think you'd get much consistent reliability with this.

      "This seems like its overloading the term knowledge graph from its origins. Rather than having information and facts encoded into the graph, this appears to be a sort of similarity search over complete responses. It's blog style \"related content\" links to documents rather than encoded facts.Searching through their sources, it looks like the problem came from Neo4j's blog post misclassifying \"knowledge augmentation\" from a Microsoft research paper with \"knowledge graph\" (because of course they had to add \"graph\" to the title).This approach is fine, and probably useful but its not a knowledge graph in the sense that its structure isn't encoding anything about why or how different entities are actually related. A concrete example in a knowledge graph you might have an entity \"Joe\" and a separate entity \"Paris\". Joe is currently located in Paris so would have a typed edge between the two entities of something like \"LocatedAt\".I didn't dive into the code but what I inferred from the description and referenced literature, it is instead storing complete responses as \"entities\" and simply doing RAG style similarity searches to other nodes. It's a graph structured search index for sure but not a knowledge graph by the standard definitions.",
      "Exactly. Glad to see this. I do think knowledge graphs are important to AI assistants and agents though and someone needs to build a knowledge graph solution for that space.The idea of actual entities and relationships defined like triples with some schema and appropriately resolved and linked can be useful for querying and building up the right context. It may even be time to start bringing back some ideas from the schema.org back the day to standardize across agents/assistants what entities and actions are represented in data fed to them.",
      "Yeah precisely. Knowledge graphs are simple to think about but as soon as you look into them you realize all the complexity is in the creation of a meaningful ontology and loading data into that ontology. I actually think LLMs can be massively useful for building up the ontology but probably not in the creation of the ontology itself (far too ambiguous and large/conceptual task for them right now).",
      "How do we build ontology using LLMs? Will the building blocks be like the different parts of a brain?\nP.S I am assuming that by \"creation of ontology itself\" means creation of AGI.",
      "Ontologies are just defining what certain category, words, and entity types mean. Commonly used in NLP for data representation (\u201cfacts\u201d/triples/etc.) in knowledge graphs and other places where the definition of an ontology helps provide structure.This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with AGI or brains. They are typically created or tuned by humans and then models fit/match/resolve entities to match the ontology.",
      "Yeah, one of the specific things I'd love to do is collaboratively bulking up WikiData more. It's missing a ton of low hanging fruit that people using an ML augmented tool could really make some good progress on, similar to ML assisted OpenStreetMapping work",
      "While I'm 100% on board with RAG using associative memory, I'm not sure you need Neo4J.  Associative recall is generally going to be one level deep, and you're doing a top K cut so even if it wasn't the second order associations are probably not going to make the relevance cut.  This could be done relationally, and then if you're using pg_vector you could retrieve all your rag contents in one query.",
      "I think there's a lot of cases where you don't want to just RAG it. If you're going for tool assisted, it's pretty neat to have agent write out queries for what it needs against the knowledge graph. There was an article recently about how LLMs are bad at inferring B is A from A is B. You can also do more precise math against it, which is useful for questions even people need to reason out.I need to dig into what they're doing here more with their approach, but I think using an LLM for both producing and consuming a knowledge graph is pretty nifty, which I wrote up about a year ago here, https://friend.computer/jekyll/update/2023/04/30/wikidata-ll... .I will say figuring out how to actually add that conversation properly into a large knowledge graph is a bit tricky. ML does seem slightly better at producing an ontology than humans though (look how many times we've had to revise scientific names for creatures or book ordering)",
      "Yes, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be an actual knowledge graph which is part of the issue imho. If you look at the Microsoft knowledge graph paper linked in the repo it looks like they build out a real entity-relationship based knowledge graph rather then storing responses and surface form text directly.",
      "My initial thought was \"building the knowledge graph is what LLMs and the embedding process does implicitly\", why the need for a graphdb like Neo4j?"

Commenters, in a desperate bid to sound like they've read more than the project's README, dive into a semantic abyss about the difference between real knowledge graphs and whatever this is supposed to be, while vaguely gesturing at the relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the creation of ontologies.

Plus, all seasons are streaming on Hulu, so you don\u2019t have to worry about whether the story will be completed.https://www.hulu.com/series/the-americans-6deba130-65fb-4816...",

When I first checked it out, the basic setup seemed rather inane and I stopped watching.Then, a couple years later, I needed something to watch during long exercise sessions and I checked it out again. It was getting much more interesting by the end of the first season.And every season got better and richer. By the very end, I experienced it as actually deep, especially in the way the Keri Russell character unexpectedly evolves. It was a real pleasure and I'm very glad I had the chance to enjoy it. Recommended!",

So I missed it the first few years and then I realized after its fourth renewal - gee maybe its good - and well - I was completely wrong. She was amazing. The show was terrific. But I'm a sucker for 80s cold war dramatics.",

Very disappointed by that aspect and I hope they're done with that excess.",
      "That's a fair statement. My standard for this type of show remains BBC's Tinker Tailor Solider Spy (1979) and the follow up Smiley's People (1982).Alec Guinness owns Smiley. Just perfect. Absolutely gripping yet low budget [+] it actually demands that you use your intellect to keep up. If you haven't seen those I say whip up ye old torrent client and get some.Anyways, I did say \"too greatly\".

So the dogs work in that context - at least for me.EDIT: someone else mentioned Tinker Tailor (either the '80s BBC miniseries or the Gary Oldman movie - once again he's killing it) which is far more grounded.

Lawyers seem to be submitting LLM-generated text to courts without even editing it, which is like the Doctor handing the prescription pad to the robot.",

RAG can and does help improve performance somewhat there, but fundamentally the model is still autoregressively predicting tokens and sampling from a distribution. And thus, it's going to predict incorrectly some of the time even if its less likely to do so.I think its certainly a worthwhile engineering effort to address the myriad of issues involved, and I'd never say this is an impossible task, but currently I continue to push caution when I see the happy path socialized to the degree it is."

It also appears to misidentify (it may have been correct at the time) PyMuPDF as GPLv3 when that appears to actually be AGPLv3. My assumption is that using this would require complying with AGPLv3?There's the additional oddity that a portion of the repository (the recipes directory) is licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA, and so the repository is not fully open source. This is particularly confusing, however, as the functional content of the recipes directory appears to be mostly records of direct observations of parameter choices in external documents and tools, and so doesn't seem like it would be copyrightable at all, at least in the US.",

      "For anyone who read the README and is now thinking that agrind is \"like jq but with aggregations\" \u2014 it's much more than that, and (at least in the tasks I use it for) really more complementary to pipeline transformer tools like jq.Specifically, the \"killer app\" feature for agrind, is that it's a live reporting tool. You can just throw a CSV file through agrind to get a nice one-shot aggregation out. But if you stream a live data source into it \u2014 think something like \"your k8s ingress controller's access logs\" \u2014 then agrind will grab your TTY; draw a table to fills it; and begin live-updating that table with the report, with the rows re-ordering to stay sorted as more data is received.Want to see e.g. the top 10 highest-duration HTTP requests by path given some particular HTTP status code? You can just start streaming logs into it, and the report will gradually come into focus as it finds matching events. Hit ^C when the data has \"stabilized\" (i.e. when datapoint ranks are no longer jumping around), and you'll be left with the last-refreshed state of the table in your terminal scrollback, to use in further investigations.agrind has jq-like manipulation tools, but honestly, I mostly still use jq for that part. I have no idea how to unwrap JSON list items in agrind (or if that's even possible), but if I want to do that, I'll just:    http localhost:8001/v1/debug/inflight-requests | jq -c '.[].jsonPayload' | agrind '* | json | sum(dur) by path'\n\n---Bonus recommendation, as it's something I use together with jq and agrind: stern (https://github.com/rancher/stern) \u2014 for live tail(1)ing of the O(N) pods of a k8s Deployment, right from the cluster, without any external log multiplexer.    stern ingress-nginx-controller -i some_path_frag -o raw 2>/dev/null | agrind '* | json | where status == 403 | count by client_addr' 2>/dev/null\n\nNote the two instances of `2>/dev/null` here.The first one is to remove the \"connected to pod XYZ\" meta info from stern(1) output, that would muck up the agrind table.The second one, though, is more interesting: it's there because unlike jq, agrind doesn't die when it hits an unparseable line! Instead, it just spits a parse error and continues. So you can have agrind consume a \"dirty\" data stream \u2014 e.g. a combined \"structured JSON access log + plaintext error log\" stream \u2014 and then just discard stderr, to silence the resulting errors printed from the failed attempts at parsing the error-log lines of the stream.",

    "summary": "In a world where everyone thinks they're just a garage sale away from being a Silicon Valley disruptor, the Cheyenne Supercomputer auction has the tech equivalent of dollar store treasure hunters drooling over specs that even the Smithsonian would consider \"historically quaint.\" Imagine the sheer delight of acquiring 1500-pound tech relics that require a Ph.D. in both computer science and heavy machinery operation to even power on. But wait, there's more! Our intrepid commenters, armed with the economic acumen of a lemonade stand, envision a bustling market for these ancient computational behemoths, confidently ignoring both the logistical nightmare of moving them and the universal truth that nostalgia doesn't make your 2016-era server run any faster. If the idea of turning a supercomputer into an oversized paperweight excites you, congratulations, you\u2019ve just envisioned the epitome of tech impotence - complete with commemorative plaques."

    "summary": "In a world thirsty for yet another way to procrastinate, an internet hero emerges with a 3D ISS tracker that not only shows you a live video feed but also cloud formations with near-real-time accuracy. Because, clearly, what the modern existential crisis needs is the ability to watch clouds drift lazily from space, effectively giving you the same view as a bored ISS astronaut, but without the hassle of a decade of training or leaving your mom's basement. The comment section quickly becomes a battleground for armchair astronomers and Flat Earthers, each making compelling arguments like, \"Cool, can it track Santa too?\" and \"This is fake because the Earth is as flat as my soda.\" Embrace the marvel of modern technology that allows us to add another layer of detachment to our already screen-dominated lives."

True to form, readers influx the comments section with the self-awareness of a potato, vehemently debating whether this \"experiment\" is a tragic commentary on society or just what happens when you're late for work and can't be bothered by another street performer. Cue the smattering of armchair philosophers, who, after skimming the article through the fog of their morning coffee, suddenly find themselves experts on art, beauty, and human nature. It's a tale as old as time, or at least as old as the internet's capacity to miss the point while loudly missing it even more in the comments."

Who knew that all it took to challenge centuries of scientific consensus were a few pretty pie charts and the kind of maps usually found in a high school geography textbook? Commenters, in a dazzling display of their in-depth scientific expertise, mostly acquired from YouTube University, engage in fiery debates that prove, once and for all, that the real flat surface at risk here is the space between their ears. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udcc9"
