      "Compared to many other countries, UK has a computer science culture that's very open about how technology is used in every day lives, and it invites public participation in new tech. This shows a lot in the government as well as its services like BBC and NHS, and the academia.It's a very broad topic to cover so I'll be terse with evidence/examples only. UK government provides a lot of open data and APIs for the country [0], [1]. They are free and pretty much not throttled. They have a license [2] for a lot of this data which is formal but nearly as free as John Carmack's legendary hacker-friendly \"have fun\" license [3]. There is also a lot of historical Ordnance Survey data and historical legislation data from the National Archives. And of course, you can see the openness in how they have built gov.uk, as blog articles appear on HN about it quite often.There is also a lot of government infrastructure provided to local governments, such as gov.uk Notify [4] or a freely available NHS website CMS (which is why many NHS websites work the same). There is a guide [5] mostly intended for government services but free for others to use on building accessible, secure and quite good-looking websites.Most other governments I lived under are either technically behind UK or they have very advanced tech capabilities in certain branches of the government only (such as the armed forces) but keep it out of the public eye. Ultimately, I think it is the culture of welcoming everyone's participation in technology that makes UK gov so forthcoming and open with their tech and data. Doing this is seen as kind and civilised, which is how governments want to be seen. Of course, there are still areas of improvement in how UK gov provides data, as there always are in everything.Finally, I should mention you can find many BBC technology outreach programmes from the early days of home computing. They are all over YouTube if you search for \"BCC home computing\". There was and continues to be a lot of techno-optimism in the country.

      "A good way to conceptualize what\u2019s going on is not the idea that balls become \"spiky\" in high dimensions \u2013 like the article says, balls are always perfectly symmetrical by definition. But it\u2019s the box becoming spiky, \"caltrop-shaped\", its vertices reaching farther and farther out from the origin as the square root of dimension, while the centers of its sides remain at exactly +-1. And the 2^N surrounding balls are also getting farther from the origin, while their radius remains 1/2. Now it should be quite easy to imagine how the center ball gets more and more room until it grows out of the spiky box.\n \nreply",
      "But there is another way to think of the high-dimensional balls where \"spikey\" is the right visualisation.Consider the volume of a cap.  Take a plane that is 90% of the distance from the centre to the edge, and look at what percentage of the volume is \"outside\" that plane.  When the dimension is high, that volume is negligible.And when the dimension is really high you can get quite close to the centre, and still the volume you cut off is very small.  In our 3D world the closest thing that has this property is a spike.  You can cut off quite close to the centre, and the volume excised is small.The sense in which a high-dimensional ball is not a spikey thing is in the symmetry, and the smoothness.So when you want to develop an intuition for a high dimensional ball you need to think of it as simultaneously symmetrical, smooth, and spikey.Then think of another five impossible things, and you can have breakfast.\n \nreply",
      "I think our geometric intuition could never be good for a high dimensional object. Consider a sphere in 3D. It's represented by the points which satisfy x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1. Because there are only three coordinates, knowing the value of one of them greatly reduces the possibilities for the other two. For example, if I know z is close to 1, then my point is close to the north pole (x and y are both close to zero).However, if I have the n-sphere x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2 = 1, knowing the value of x_1 gives me very little information about all the other coordinates. And humans' interaction with the geometry is reality is somewhat limited to manipulating one coordinate at a time, i.e., our intuition is for built on things like moving our body linearly through space, not dilating the volume or surface area of our bodies.\n \nreply",
      "That's a good point. High dimensional objects can obtain very unintuitive properties, like you describe.This to me feels similar in many ways to how a corner in a high dimensional n-cube, although 90 degrees, no matter how you measure it, seems extremely spiky. As the shape does not increase in width, but the corners extend arbitrarily far away from the center. A property reserved for spiky things in 3D.\n \nreply",

The Schema module has a nice convention for expressing validators, and it's very composable and flexible: https://effect.website/docs/guides/schema/introductionThere are also really nice aspects like the interoperability between Schema and Data, allowing you to safely parse data from outside your application boundary then perform safe operations like exhaustively matching on tagged types (essentially discriminated unions): https://effect.website/docs/other/data-types/data#is-and-mat...It feels extremely productive and intuitive once you get the hang of it.

You shouldn't use them for everything. For some things, it's a bad idea not to (in my opinion).Then of course subjectivity is a factor here. Some people will never like conventions like Effect, and that's fine too. Just write what feels right.\n \nreply",
      "Effect is not only much easier to get productive on than Ramda, but it provides an entire ecosystem.Our team is full effect from two years and juniors can pick it and start working on it with ease.\n \nreply",
      "I think going all-in on Effect in its current state is not something I'd do. However there's a subset of its functionality that I'm currently replicating with a bunch of different libraries: ts-pattern, zod, some lightweight result / option wrapper like ts-belt, etc. Pretty much trying to pretend I'm writing ML / OCaml. Having those all in one package is quite convenient. Add in TypeScript's the much needed story around retry / observability / error handling\u2014I see why people lean into it.Having experience with ZIO / FP in Scala, I'm a bit biased in seeing the value of Effect systems as a whole, but taking on the burden of explaining that mental model to team members and future maintainers is a big cost for most teams.\n \nreply",

Here it says Hasabis did an undergraduate degree in a computer science program, and them spent a decade working on computer games at studios, and then somehow just rocked up to a university and asked to do a PhD in neuroscience.I feel if I tried to do that in the US- (where I got a masters degree in engineering,  spent a 15 yrs as an aerospace engineer,)- tried to go back and ask to do a PhD in, say, Physics - I'd be promptly told to go fuck myself (or, fuck myself but then enroll in a new undergrad or maaaybe graduate program only after re-taking GRE's. Straight PhD? Never heard it work like that.)\n \nreply",
      "There is a lot of variation in how PhD studies work. In some places, you are just a faceless candidate applying to a department, which discourages you from contacting the faculty before you are admitted. In other places, you must convince a professor to supervise and fund you before you are even allowed to apply. Some universities require you (or your supervisor) pay tuition fees for a number of years before you can graduate, while others don't care what you do, as long as you can produce a thesis that meets their standards.You can jump from social sciences to STEM. Your formal admission can wait for a year or two after you actually started. Or you can move to another university and get a PhD in a few months, because the administrative requirements in the original one were too unreasonable. These things happen, because universities are independent organizations that like doing things their own way.\n \nreply",

He wasn't just some random programmer.\n \nreply",
      "Why do you think that? It\u2019s not my experience. At the grad school level they\u2019ll take anyone who can do the work and is interested. Outside experience, even in unrelated fields, is often a plus. Grad students just out of undergrad have no idea how the world works.\n \nreply",
      "I made the jump from mostly-math undergrad to materials science PhD (close to chemistry/physics, if you don't know the field). I was welcomed with open arms.If you've got any math-heavy STEM graduate degree, you can likely jump into a physics PhD. You might need to take some senior-level undergraduate courses to catch up, but the transition is quite doable. At some point, your overall intelligence, enthusiasm, and work ethic matter more than your specific background.\n \nreply",

      "Loving the discourse in the comments here.  Speaking as someone who grew up alongside Google in a sense, I fall on the side of the \"break it up\" camp.  It was novel at the time to have a single company so nicely provide us with everything digitally that we could need - G Suite, YouTube, Search, Maps, Advertising, Books, Reader, etc - but in hindsight, we gave too much power to too unaccountable an entity, who in turn used it to choke off any avenues to challenge its dominance.As for the rebuttal of \"bUt ThE gDp\", there's a counter-argument to be made that the GDP would have grown just as much with a higher diversity and stringent M&A regulations by spurring on new businesses and concepts, as opposed to mainstreaming fad after fad that seemingly solely benefits the established players.  There's another argument to be made equating GDP values to desirable targets creates a Goodhart's Law problem, thereby making GDP as a measure of growth or success a bad metric; the rise of income and wealth inequality these past few decades, when there was increased focus on GDP as a target of growth or success, could be viewed as evidence supporting said argument.It's worth noting that this case against Google is likely to be the bellwether for future divestments and breakups.  Whatever comes next will be an invaluable learning experience for both sides, just like AT&T and Microsoft's own anti-trust woes were learning experiences for the current crop of companies.\n \nreply",

Nevermind that Chrome already ships with its own adblocker which blocks bad ads.The fact is that with the Spectre mitigations added to Chrome, the performance of networking with manifest v2 was bad. Having to keep sending every network request through 3 different processes just in case there is a plugin (uses by the minority of users) that wants to filter the requests before they are made.Of course, blocking resource fetches like that could have easily been detected by any server that cares about it, and the interaction with service workers was...weird.With manifest v3 you can still block ads.

Armed to the teeth with scuba gear and an unwieldy clipboard, they plunge into the \"inky, inscrutable water\" because, apparently, reading marine biology textbooks doesn't cut it anymore. Readers once again bravely battle through dense poetic descriptions to glean that someone saw a cute fish while diving.

      "As the son of two artists, both of whom never liked gold, Klimt is a strange breed: My parents have made a ton of murals, jam-packed with gold. Not because they wanted but because rich people(the type of people who want murals in their homes and can afford it) love it as an expression of their financial status. Both of them hated much of those murals and I can only name a handful of works they truly liked, at the end of the day, the customer is always right. And having seen much of their work(and taking some part on a few occasions circumstantially since I can't draw a single line to save my life), I completely agree with them. We have a word which roughly translates to mobbaroque in English. In almost all cases, this is exactly what it is.Having said that, my mom specifically has a few favorite artists, Klimt being one of them. Over the years she's been asked to make dozens of Klimt replicas(The Kiss probably accounting for 80% of them) and she's loved doing all of them. I think Klimt is the only artist to successfully incorporate gold into his paintings without making them look obnoxious or ostentatious. Not only that but made them look incredible. Admittedly I never looked all that deep as to why he was \"obsessed\" with it.\n \nreply",
      "Mobbaroque -> Mob Baroque.To me that's New York Italian, with lots of marble, gold, and extreme decor. It's a big marble tub with gold fixtures and maybe a couple of statues hanging around for good measure...in a marble/gold/mirrors bath.\n \nreply",
      "Or the bathroom at Mar-a-Lago ?\n \nreply",

      "Aside from Klimt it could be argued that Maurizio Cattelan has successfully incorporated gold into his work - although in the form of sculpture. His work \"America\", a solid gold functioning toilet,  attracted quite a few crowds (apparently over 100K people \"used\" it), one notable theft, and certainly made a statement.

      "You may appreciate the following anecdote about Picasso. He was offered a lot of money to make a sculpture entirely in hold. His response was \u2018Great! I will paint it black!\u2019.\n \nreply",
      "I use it a lot but then again I lived a rock throw away from his house for a long period of my life but since The Rolling Stones are a bit closer to my heart, I usually resort to one of their famous songs.\n \nreply",
      "Klimt does use gold very well. But I am surprised by your claim...> I think Klimt is the only artist to successfully incorporate gold into his paintings without making them look obnoxious or ostentatious.Byzantine iconography comes off as neither obnoxious nor ostentatious. The use of gold in Botticelli's works wonderfully. And so on. What exactly is an example of \"obnoxious or ostentatious\" use of gold in art? I can only think of ridiculous things like gold-plated toilets. Perhaps you were exposed to especially egregious works that are not familiar to the general public?\n \nreply",
      "I think both Byzantine iconography and Botticelli\u2019s works were invented to be ostentatious.  Gold toilets/plates/etc come off as obnoxious because the use of gold is actively detrimental rather than simply eye catching.\n \nreply",
      "It wasn't until later in the Byzantine period that gold was used excessively in art. In the early period when it was largely confined to halos, as a contrasting accent around painted halos, or to convey specific religious symbolism, it was hardly ostentatious.\n \nreply"

    "summary": "<b>Gustav Klimt's Gold Glut: Art for the Nouveau Riche</b>\n\nOnce again, <i>artnet.com</i> takes a deep, scholarly dive into the mysterious world of Gustav Klimt's obsession with gold, only to surface with the groundbreaking realization that rich people like shiny things. Luckily, a commenter, blessed with artist parents who specialize in dutifully plastering walls with bourgeois bling, enlightens us further by sharing the profound vernacular term \"<em>Mob Baroque</em>,\" evidently capturing the true essence of artistic sell-out. Amid a sea of commenters competing to demonstrate their esoteric knowledge about everything from Byzantine iconographics to black-painted gold sculptures by Picasso, we learn perhaps the only clear truth: Klimt\u2019s gold phase really was just about making those filthy-rich patrons feel as opulent as their marble-swathed, statue-littered bathrooms. Meanwhile, the Internet remains undefeated in converting a discussion about art into a virtual tour of Mar-a-Lago\u2019s plumbing. \ud83d\udebd\u2728"
