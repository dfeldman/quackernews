Chinese and Japanese borrowings could be written using the original hanzi, e.g. \"gung-ho\" would be , and \"tycoon\" as .  \n\nYou can already see that this is going to be tricky.  We've just given  two readings, for instance-- /wrk/ and /g\u00fbng/-- and  two as well-- /rulr/ and /kun/.  \n\nProper names will be a problem as well.  Again, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names already have hanzi forms-- e.g.  for the name of the bodaciously cute singer Faye Wong-- but for English names we'd have no better recourse than to spell things out using the nearest Chinese syllables.
