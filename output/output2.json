      "IMO, the most interesting thing about this line is the battery life---within an hour of MBP3 and within 2 hours of Asus's Qualcomm. Making it comparable to ARM architectures.Which is a little surprising because ARM is commonly believed to be much more power efficient than x86.[1] https://youtu.be/Z8WKR0VHfJw?si=A7zbFY2lsDa8iVQN&t=277\n \nreply",
      "ARM got a lot of hype since the release of the M1, but most users only compared it to the terrible Intel MBPs. Ryzen mobile has been consistently close to Apple silicon perf/watt for 5 years. But got little press coverage.Hype can be really decorrelated from real world performance.\n \nreply",
      "Any efficiency comparison involving Apples chips also has to factor in that Tim Cook keeps showing up at TSMCs door with a freight container full of cash to buy out exclusive access to their bleeding edge silicon processes. ARM may be a factor but don't underestimate the power of having more money than God.Case in point, Strix Point is built on TSMC 4nm while Apple is already using TSMCs second generation 3nm process.\n \nreply",
      "Process helps but have you seen benchmarks showing equivalent performance between the same process node? I think it\u2019s less that ARM is amazing than the Apple Silicon team being very good and paired with aggressive optimization throughout the stack but everything I\u2019ve seen suggests they are simply building better chips at their target levels (not server, high power, etc.).\n \nreply",
      "But how is this the case? I never saw a single article mentioning that a non-Mac laptop was better.(Random article saying M3 pro is better than a Dell laptop https://www.tomsguide.com/news/macbook-pro-m3-and-m3-max-bat... )\n \nreply",

      "Ryzen mobile is consistently close, yeah. But with the sole exception of the Steam deck, I've yet to see a Ryzen mobile-bearing laptop, Windows included, which is close to the overall performance of the Macbook.\n \nreply",
      "> But with the sole exception of the Steam deckUuh wut? The Steam Deck is like 3-generation-old hardware in mobile Ryzen terms. In a lot of ways it's similar to a pared-back 4800u with fewer (and older) cores, and a slightly bumped up GPU.To me it's kinda the opposite. Excluding the Steam Deck, I think most of AMD's Ultrabook APUs have been very close to the products Apple's made on the equivalent nodes. Even on 7nm the 4800u put up a competitive fight against M1, and the gap has gotten thinner with each passing year. According to the OpenCL benchmarks, the Radeon 680m on 6nm scores higher than the M1 on 5nm: https://browser.geekbench.com/opencl-benchmarksEven back when Ryzen Mobile only shipped with Vega, it was pretty clear that Apple and AMD were a pretty close match in onboard GPU power.\n \nreply",
      "Steam Deck might be behind in terms of hardware but in terms of software it's way beyond your typical x86 linux system power efficiency, and dare I say it's doing better than windows. All that contributes to make it punch well above it's weight.\n \nreply",
      "Battery tests are important, but so is how it fairs on battery (what is the performance drop off to maintain that), what\u2019s its performance is ant its peak and how it long before it throttles when pushed.The M series processors have succeeded in all four: battery life, performance parity between battery and plugged in, high performance and performance sustainability.So far, very few benchmarks have been comparing the latter three as part of the full package assessment.\n \nreply"

I guess they are saying that that chocolate has 9.3ug of cadmium in a 30g sample but it's impossible to say from what they wrote.The FDA states that the maximum daily consumption of cadmium should be limited to 0.21-0.36ug per kg of body mass. For an avg american male that would mean a threshold of 17.64-30.24ug/day. A typical salad containing 250g of romaine lettuce has 2-14ug of cadmium in it.

However there are just some problems (that are not the fault of OpenSnitch) that I'm not even sure that are even solvable.For example, supposed I run `curl` on the terminal, I can either always decide on a case-by-case basis to allow it thru, or I'm required to whitelist it permanently.\nOnce I've whitelisted generic tools like `curl` or `wget`, then the floodgates are really open, since any malware that have compromised my machine can just use `curl` or `wget` to get to the internet without hitting the firewall.\n \nreply",

And once the habit is built, it\u2019s pretty easy to manage.Editing to add: I also use expiring rules regularly. Maybe I trust an installer and want to let it do its thing. So I open it up with a rule for the executable expiring in the near future (options include: forever, until reboot, for the next 30s, for the next 5 mins, etc).

I don\u2019t have to update rules all that often (usually a few rules/week), and when I do, it\u2019s usually a 10-30 second detour.

      "Hey HN,For the past few months, as part of my job at Supabase, I have been working on pg_replicate. pg_replicate lets you very easily build applications which can copy data (full table copies and cdc) from Postgres to any other data system. Around six months back I was figuring out what can be built by tailing Postgres' WAL. pg_replicate grew organically out of that effort. Many similar tools, like Debezium, exist already which do a great job, but pg_replicate is much simpler and focussed only on Postgres. Rust was used in the project because I am most comfortable with it. pg_replicate abstracts over the Postgres logical replication protocol[0] and lets you work with higher level concepts. There are three main concepts to understand pg_replicate: source, sink and pipeline.1/ A source is a Postgres db from which data is to be copied.\n2/ A sink is a data system into which data will be copied.\n3/ A pipeline connects a source to a sink.Currently pg_replicate supports BigQuery, DuckDb local file and, MotherDuck as sinks. More sinks will be added in future. To support a new data system, you just need to implement the BatchSink trait (older Sink trait will be deprecated soon).pg_replicate is still under heavy development and is a little thin on documentation. Performance is another area which hasn't received much attention. We are releasing this to get feedback from the community and are still evaluating how (or if) we can integrate it with the Supabase platform. Comments and feedback are welcome.[0] Postgres logical replication protocol: [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-logical-rep...)\n \nreply",
      "I\u2019m curious in your experience how many clients can run pg_replicate at once?With MySQL I saw the interesting use-case of the black hole storage engine to scale out replication logs but ultimately the only usage I\u2019m aware of was for scaling other mysql read replicas.The idea of scaling an application by tailing logs from a database sounds very interesting to me, and I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve explored this at all.  There\u2019s of course things like Kafka (and then things like Debezium), but it\u2019s hard to beat direct!\n \nreply",
      "This is so cool! I appreciate Debezium for its wide DB support (no part of me wants to know the inner workings of MSSQL's replication protocol) but it's finnicky to run. Great to have an alternative, at least for postgres.\n \nreply",
      "I've recently been playing with the logical replication protocol, and it enables all kinds of interesting usages. one really cool thing is that you see the transactional boundaries, so not only can you write a cache, you can do so in a way thats internally consistent.its also inherently much nicer than listen/notify, since you don't have to go back and figure out what data was associated with the event\n \nreply",
      "This is super timely.Windmill (https://windmill.dev) used to only support webhooks to trigger code and flow jobs. We have just added email support building our own MX server, and wanted to add CDC change. We were gonna do it on Debezium but this will allow us to remove the need for a third-party service and just add this as a crate. Thank you supabase for open-sourcing this.\n \nreply",
      "Postgres + Rust is one of the most exciting intersections of tech I've seen in a while.There's external tooling like his project, but postgres extensions in Rust are exciting.Full extensions via pgrx have been cool to see, but plrust + pg_tle is also starting to show up.If you aren't familiar with TLE (Trusted Language Extensions), it is a postgres extension from AWS that created some privileged interfaces for procedural languages (used for user-defined functions) to do some extra stuff. Right now it's mostly auth-related hooks but my hope is that it expands in the future.Plrust is a procedural language extension for Rust, allowing user defined functions written in Rust.The combination of those two could open up a world of rich extensions usable in managed hosted environments like RDS.\n \nreply",
      "I was trying out the stdout example. Could not get it to log anything. DuckDB example worked so I went digging into the source. Apparently the stdout sink is using tracing and I did not have a `RUST_LOG` env var set.Might be a good idea to have it documented or have the default level set to info for the stdout example.Maybe this is common Rust knowledge and I just don't know what I'm doing though.\n \nreply",
      "I too consider this a footgun.Most applications will have something like   tracing_subscriber::registry()\n           .with(\n               tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::try_from_default_env()\n                   .unwrap_or_else(|_| \"my_app=info\".into()),\n           )\n           .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())\n           .init();\n\n\nin the `main.rs` which will default the tracing if RUST_LOG env var is not set.\n \nreply",
      "Nice! I'm one of the authors of pg-bifrost which is in the same space. Have you thought about / have solved sharding consumption across multiple slots / multi consumers to increase throughput? This is on my radar but not something I've investigated yet.The issue we've ran into is some team at work decides to re-write an entire table and things get backed up until they stop updating rows.\n \nreply",
      "Wow I think i build one of the first pg-rust-cdc replication module for postgresql and now it seems mainstream. It was a part of my https://github.com/posix4e/rpgffi project, which is garbage code I'm now embarrassed about. Rust programming has come a long way and we didn't have the best practices.

[1]The need to keep Epi-Pens below 77 degrees F (86F for short periods) is extremely constraining for something that you are supposed to carry with you at all times.

      "It is completely anecdotal but in my local experience I've seen the following pattern happen: rent is increased substantially, present tenants move out, no one new applies, unit becomes empty, rent is decreased until someone new finally moves in.  I'm not a landlord but I don't think there is a rational basis for kicking all of your rent paying tenants out and then having half a dozen units go empty in the hope that you can squeeze an extra 100 every month out of someone, maybe, in the future.\n \nreply",
      "This is only irrational for the landlords, not the software suggesting prices to them. If you churn 10% of your units, but prices go up by 20%, then you're making more money a rental management company.\n \nreply",

My guess is that the landlord thought the market was going to bear the price increase, and went all-in on it rather than only doing it on a portion of his tenants.\n \nreply",
      "> Which one is it? Was the increase \"substantial\" or was it only 100 bucks?A 100 increase over 800 is a 12.5% increase, which is substantial relatively speaking.  In my case they wanted 150 over 800 which is an 18.75% increase.  After I said no (as well as everyone else in the complex) they wanted 1000 which is a 20% increase.  I have to say your comment comes off as condescending to me.  For many people $100 may be the difference between being able to afford a home and being homeless.  Now everyone has left, the units are all empty, and they are asking for 800 (after asking 950, then 900, then 850).> Hindsight is 20/20. My guess is that the landlord thought the market was going to bear the price increase, and went all-in on it rather than only doing it on a portion of his tenants.That is one way to describe it.  Or, to describe what you said in other words, trying to squeeze every penny out of tenants, creating an inconvenience for five people (who would have probably rather stayed and put up with a modest 2-5% increase), then losing money after all because all of the properties are now vacant.\n \nreply",
      "> I have to say your comment comes off as condescending to me. For many people $100 may be the difference between being able to afford a home and being homeless.The implication that $100 isn't a lot of money comes from your original comment, not me. After all, the thesis in your original comment was that the landlord risked a bunch of reliable tenants for a small rent increase. It wouldn't have made sense otherwise (eg. the landlord risking the current tenants for a chance of $500 rent increase).\n \nreply",
      "Now I see the source of confusion.  I think $100 from the perspective of a tenant may be quite a lot (as mentioned a 12.5% increase).  However as you said my thesis is from a landlord's perspective $100 is insignificant with all things considered.  If even one unit were empty for two months, that would be an annual loss greater than the extra money they would make from the previous tenants.  Also in our case they already have had a unit empty for over six months now which further baffles me.  Apologies if I read into your comment too much.",
      "> Which one is it? Was the increase \"substantial\" or was it only 100 bucks?Not OP, but here is how I interpreted this.Increase rents substantially -> no one takes it -> decrease rents over time until it hits a rate the market can bare -> people move in when rents are 100 dollars above what the previous tenets were paying.\n \nreply",
      "Anecdata of 1 but. In July 2021 got place for too much $$$. In July 2022 they said the rent was going up $400 a month. I moved out. In July 2023 they were asking $100 less than I was paying in July 2021I have no idea if that was this software or market change or what. It was huge complex. 700-800 units. At the time I just guessed that they raise the rent for everyone when their lease is up because most people don't want to move and will put up with the rent increase even if they hate it.For me, the place had issues. If the rent had stayed the same I'd have put up with them just because it's easier to put off finding a new place, but $400 a month was enough for me to just move.\n \nreply",
      "Markets are rational eventually but the keyword is eventually. No timeline is provided.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, that's weirdly inefficient and annoying for everyone. What would be great would be if there was some algorithmic way to determine the market value for an apartment to minimize vacancy and be fair to both the current tenants and those that want to move in\n \nreply"
