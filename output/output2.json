      "Oh, nice. Third party implementations of Nanite playback.Nanite is a very clever representation of graphics meshes. They're directed acyclic graphs rather than trees. Repetition is a link, not a copy. It's recursive; meshes can share submeshes, which in turn can share submeshes, all the way down. It's also set up for within-mesh level of detail support, so the submeshes drop out when they're small enough. \nSo you can have repetitive content of very large size with a finite amount of data and fast rendering times. The insight is that there are only so many pixels on screen, so there's an upper bound on rendering work really needed.There's a really good SIGGRAPH video on this from someone at Epic.Current GPU designs are a mismatch for Nanite, Some new hardware operations are needed to do more of this in the GPU, where it belongs. Whether that will happen, with NVidia distracted by the AI market, is a good question.The scene needs a lot of instancing for this to pay off. Unreal Engine demos show such things as a hall of identical statues. If each statue was different, Nanite would help far less. So it works best for projects where a limited number of objects are reused to create large areas of content. That's the case for most AAA titles. Watch a video of Cyberpunk 2077, and look for railings and trash heaps. You'll see the same ones over and over in totally different contexts.Making a nanite mesh is complicated, with a lot of internal offsets for linking, and so far only Unreal Engine's editor does it. With playback now open source, someone will probably do that.Those internal offsets in the format present an attack surface which probably can be exploited with carefully crafted bad content, like hostile Microsoft Word .doc files.\n \nreply",
      "> Repetition is a link, not a copy. It's recursive; meshes can share submeshes, which in turn can share submeshes, all the way down.While it does construct a DAG to perform the graph cut, the final data set on disk is just a flat list of clusters for consideration, along with their cutoffs for inclusion/rejection. There seems to be a considerable misunderstanding of what the DAG is used for, and how it's constructed. It's constructed dynamically based on the vertex data, and doesn't have anything to do with how the artist constructed submeshes and things, nor does \"repetition become a link\".> The scene needs a lot of instancing for this to pay off. Unreal Engine demos show such things as a hall of identical statues. If each statue was different, Nanite would help far less.What makes you say this? The graph cut is different for each instance of the object, so they can't use traditional instancing, and I don't even see how it could help.\n \nreply",
      "It may not be based on what the mesh's creator considered repetition, but repetition is encoded within the mesh. Not sure if the mesh builder discovers some of the repetition itself.Look at a terrain example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKvA7NZRUcg\n \nreply",
      "I'm not seeing what you claim to be seeing in that demo video. I see a per-triangle debug view, and a per-cluster debug view. None of that is showing repetition.\n \nreply",
      "If there wasn't repetition, you'd need a really huge GPU for that scene at that level of detail.\n \nreply",
      "Not necessarily. Nanite compresses meshes (including in-memory) _very_ heavily, and _also_ streams in only the visible mesh data.In general, I wouldn't think of Nanite as \"one thing\". It's a combination of many, many different techniques that add up into some really good technology.\n \nreply",
      "I don't want to estimate storage space right now, but meshes can be stored very efficiently. For example, I think UE uses an optimization where vertex positions are heavily quantized to just a few bits within the meshlet's bounding box. Index buffers can be constructed to share the same vertices across LOD levels. Shading normals can be quantized quite a bit before shading artifacts become noticeable - if you even need them anymore at that triangle density.If your triangles are at or below the size of a texel, texture values could even be looked up offline and stored in the vertex attributes directly rather than keeping the UV coordinates around, but that may not be a win.\n \nreply",
      "In a past life (2000's) I was doing some dev stuff on Ps3, trying to figure out so decent uses for Cell's mass of compute and working around RSX's limited memory bandwidth while having the luxury of Blu-ray storage to burn through.One such thing I did get a fair way into was something like Nanite - I called it compressive meshing. It is the typical case of misguided engineering hubris at work.The initial work looked promising but the further into the problem I get the more complicated the entire thing become. Having to construct the entire asset generation pipeline was just way beyond what I could manage in the time frame that would look anything decent and not blow out the memory required.I did manage to get something that vague resembled large scale meshes being rendered in a staggered level of detail but it ran SLOW and looked like rubbish unless you hammered the GPU to get sub-pixel accuracy. It was a fun experiment but it was far too much for the hardware and too big of a task to take on as a single programmer.When Epic showed off Nantine... wow they did what I never could in a fashion way beyond even my best vision! It is one of those technologies that when it came along really was a true solution rather than just hype. Yes there are limits as with anything on that scale but it is one of the technical jewels of the modern graphics world. I have said that if Epic was public traded company I would considered putting in a sizable amount of money just based on Nanite tech alone.\n \nreply",

      "This is fantastic. I've implemented OAuth2 4-5 times over the past few years. It seams overly complicated at first, but over time I've come to understand more of the vulnerabilities each piece of complexity exists to mitigate. Every time I've thought I could do it simpler, I eventually discovered a vulnerability in my approach. You get basically all that knowledge here in a concise blog post. This is going to be the first thing I link anyone to if they're interested in learning OAuth.One gripe from Attack #3[0]:> The solution is to require Pied Piper to register all possible redirect URIs first. Then, Hooli should refuse to redirect to any other domain.There's actually a another (better IMO) solution to this problem, though to date it's rarely used. Instead of requiring client registration, you can simply let clients provide their own client_id, with the caveat that it has to be a URI, and a strict prefix of the redirect_uri. Then you can show it to the user so they know exactly where the token is being sent, but you also cut out a huge chunk of complexity from your system. I learned about it here[1].[0]: https://stack-auth.com/blog/oauth-from-first-principles#atta...[1]: https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web\n \nreply",
      "> Then you can show it to the user so they know exactly where the token is being sentUnfortunately, most major websites end up hosting an endpoint that will redirect users to a separate URL provided as a query parameter. This means that users may easily be misled about where the token is, in fact, being sent.[0] - https://sec.okta.com/articles/2021/02/stealing-oauth-tokens-...\n[1] - https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819#section-4.2.4\n \nreply",
      "> most major websitesIs this true? Do you know of any major ones offhand? That would be surprising to me.Thanks for sharing [0]. I found its discussion of shared subdomain cookies useful. However, I believe all the vulnerabilities in the OAuth section would be mitigated by using PKCE and not using the implicit flow, even if you leave the open redirect. Am I missing anything there?As for open redirects in general, it is an important problem. As an authorization server, if you want to protect against clients that might have an open redirect (and as you indicate eventually one will), while still using the simple scheme I mentioned above, I can think of a few options:1. Require the client_id to exactly match the redirect_uri instead of just a prefix. This is probably the most secure, but can result in ugly client IDs shown to the user, like \"example.com/oauth2/callback\". Of course clients can control that and make it something prettier if they want.2. Strip any query params from the redirect_uri, and document this behavior. That should handle most cases, but it's always possible clients implement an open redirect in the path itself somehow. You could also check for strings like \"http\", but at some point there's only so much you can do.3. Require clients to implement client metadata[1], so you can get back to exact string matches. This is a very new standard, and also doesn't work for localhost clients.[0]: https://sec.okta.com/articles/2021/02/stealing-oauth-tokens-...[1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-parecki-oauth-cl...\n \nreply",

      "Early on in my career (I was a late bloomer and already in early 30's) as a developer, I got burnt out pretty bad twice. After the second time and teetering on a third, I knew I had to do something to change what I was doing and how I managed my work load.I just focused on getting MY stuff done and that was it. I stopped taking on other's people work. I stopped taking on more work once I got my stuff done. I would do exactly what a Sprint called for. Nothing more, nothing less. If I finished early with my tasks, I would stretch out the time and just tell the scrum master I was close, but not done yet, but always finished on time. I basically just did what was required of me. I wasn't out to impress anybody, I just became \"Mr. Dependable\" on any of the teams I worked on.This was the approach that changed everything.Now, some ten years later? I'm never too high or too low. I still do the same thing, I still just do what is asked of me and that's it. 5pm every night? Laptop gets turned off. Friday at 6pm? Laptop is off for the entire weekend. I turn it back on right before my meetings on Monday. Separating my personal life from my work life with a hard delimiter was paramount.I found out that if you don't protect your sanity and your own well being, people will take advantage of you and your time and it will never end. Once you break the cycle and get that time back for yourself? You'll make sure you never willingly give it to someone else ever again.Protect yourself. Protect your sanity.

My burn out coincided with my IBD episode) could be an early symptom to back off the throttle a bit.Subjective: I've learnt to remember that look on someone face who's heading down burn out wall.In long distance cycling, in order to not 'bonk', you must fuel and hydrate sufficiently and consistently over time. With burn out, I feel the same dynamics apply, but with different 'fuel' and 'hydration'. And every person is so different that the rate of replenishment needed should and have a wide variance.What really helped me get out was, ironically COVID, when I couldn't do anything about my startup and I had to stop it and rest. The bleeding with my IBD just went away during the peak of lockdowns. Started to build and buy stuff, for leisure, that I enjoyed and had postponed away in my hustling years.On hope: The human body and brain has a remarkable capability to recover and heal itself.

      "Nice thing about git feature flags: the state of your system is all in one place. It changes only when you do a code release, which includes feature flag values, or an infrastructure release. You can easily see, just off git history, when the state of the system changed (and what changed), which makes incident debugging much easier.With DB feature flags, there's one more source of truth for changes to production infra.(downside, of course, is that changing feature flag values is much slower using git vs DB)\n \nreply",
      "This! 100% All the same benefits of config as code, infra as code. And with feature flags if something goes wrong its a simple `git revert` to get back into the previous state.Another benefit is you can easily replicate the current (or previous) state of production/staging/etc flags locally just by doing a `git clone` and then run our self-hosted version locally. Its a single binary, can be installed with curl or homebrew and can read the flag state from your local filesytem.This allows you to test your code locally or in CI with the same state in production\n \nreply",

      "Thank you so much! Great question. Kalmia actually borrows elements from all three, but in different ways:* On the GUI side, it leans heavily towards TinaCMS. We even considered using TinaCMS directly (Tinasaurus (https://github.com/tinacms/tinasaurus)) but ultimately built our own for better integration with our backend.* For the backend (MDX -> HTML) generation, it's very similar to Docusaurus. We use a tool called RsPress, which is part of the RsBuild/RsPack tool suite. It's relatively new, but because it's written in Rust, it's much faster than Docusaurus. (Fun fact, if you look at the commit history you will see that we initially used Docusaurus but then migrated away from it!)* Wiki.js is extremely extensive, but it\u2019s dropping support for SQLite, which was a big factor for us. Also, its frontend for documentation doesn\u2019t feel as fast as RsPress (you can try ours out on kalmia.difuse.io it's hosted on single core azure server). The biggest reason we didn\u2019t go with Wiki.js was the versioning system\u2014it felt clunky (or non existent for entire docs?). In Kalmia, versioning the entire documentation is just a one-click process.So, in short, Kalmia combines a TinaCMS-like editing experience with Docusaurus-like static site generation, but with speed advantages from the latest Rust based tooling for SSG.\n \nreply",

People pull Clojure examples out of books that are 12 or more years old and they still run.I think there's some very exciting things in the Clojure space, such as Clerk (https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk) for live notebooks, and Babashka (https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) for amazing (and amazingly fast) scripting.\n \nreply",

I have a small bottle of DMSO at home, wonder if should buy some Doritos on the way home :)\n \nreply"

      "I've had a handful of lemons thrown at me during my life. One of the most impactful ones as far as I can tell is that through a weird chain of coincidences I ended up first in line to purchase a foreclosed home. From what I understood, the couple was going through a nasty divorce and couldn't agree on who would get the house and ultimately didn't pay anything for a while, so I picked it up for 80k, which back then was probably 50% of what the market value was. This was hige for kme because as a kid my family was actually evicted from the house we were renting (not for financial-related reasons) but it was sudden so home security has always been important to me.Having been able to pay off my house has had the most tremendous postive impact on my mental health I think. Sure, it's a small house, and it's old, and the kitchen is small, and so on... but man, I'm so glad I never have to worry about making a house payment.\n \nreply",

      ">> Having been able to pay off my house has had the most tremendous postive impact on my mental health I thinkAgree on that. I own my house with no mortgage since before the pandemic and it doesn't make much financial sense to pass up a 3% mortgage but it makes mental health sense.Yes, I owe property taxes. Yes, the city could raise them. If I completely stopped paying them today, it would take them a decade to kick me out. It's nice from a mental health perspective to have a 10 year runway to plan your next move.\n \nreply",
      "When my ex-wife and I were first house shopping in Chicago, we looked at a handful of short sales\u00b9 and I am still haunted by the site of one defeated homeowner sitting on the sofa of his home as we looked around his home deciding if we wanted to buy it.\u00b2\u2e3b1. For those who don\u2019t know, a short sale is one step up from foreclosure: The homeowner and lender agree to a sale for less than the outstanding balance on the mortgage. The buyer must not be related to the seller and the seller does receive a few thousand dollars of the sale proceeds. On the flipside, the amount of the mortgage that is not paid off is considered income and the seller must pay taxes on that.2. We ended up not buying any of the short sale homes in the community where we were looking, but instead purchased a home that was a traditional sale.\n \nreply",
      "During this same time period I had a project at a part-time gig which involved updating document templates and adding a few fields here and there for a legal application. The application was used by a law firm which specialized in mortgages. So I saw the details of various documents one is served in these situations: notice of default, acceleration notices, notice to vacate, and ultimately evictions and foreclosure auctions. And of course you could see thousands of these documents being generated and mailed out. For a guy like the one in the post to show up, you probably would have had to completely ignore probably a dozen of these documents for at least 6 months, not paying your mortgage all along.Sometimes I feel like this experience, especially the idea that the entire principal balance can be accelerated if you don't make your payments regardless of the value of the house, left a bit of a scar on me that caused me to miss out on the ZIRP real estate boom II. But I am still happy with the way things are turning out overall.\n \nreply",
      "There was a Planet Money story about Zombie Mortgages. Home owners thought a second mortgage had been annulled, sometimes even being explicitly told that. Years of no statements being sent and suddenly collections was asking for money on what the home owner thought was a done deal. Even the bank was claiming it was some weird fraud attempt.

      "Indeed.  When I lived in an apparent, got a very angry knock at the door.  Before I even got up, manager already was unlocking the door without asking, with a formal eviction notice in hand.Every month I faithfully put my rent check in an envelope, deposited the slot at the office.That month they accidentally threw away the check after opening the envelope.They really didn\u2019t believe I had paid, despite being a good tenant for years, always on time.
