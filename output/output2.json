      "IMO other than the Microsoft IP issue, I think the biggest thing that has shifted since this acquisition was first in the works is Claude Code has absolutely exploded. Forking an IDE and all the expense that comes with that feels like a waste of effort, considering the number of free/open source CLI agentic tools that are out there.Let's review the current state of things:- Terminal CLI agents are several orders of magnitude less $$$ to develop than forking an entire IDE.- CC is dead simple to onboard (use whatever IDE you're using now, with a simple extension for some UX improvements).- Anthropic is free to aggressively undercut their own API margins (and middlemen like Cursor) in exchange for more predictable subscription revenue + training data access.What does Cursor/Windsurf offer over VS Code + CC?- Tab completion model (Cursor's remaining moat)- Some UI niceties like \"add selection to chat\", and etc.Personally I think this is a harbinger of where things are going. Cursor was fastest to $900M ARR and IMO will be fastest back down again.reply",
      "Agreed on everything. Just to add, not only anthropic is offering CC at like a 500% loss, they restricted sonnet/opus 4 access to windsurf, and jacked up their enterprise deal to Cursor. The increase in price was so big that it forced cursor to make that disastrous downgrade to their plans.I think only way Cursor and other UX wrappers still win is if on device models or at least open source models catch up in the next 2 years. Then i can see a big push for UX if models are truly a commodity. But as long as claude is much better then yes they hold all the cards. (And don't have a bigger company to have a civil war with like openai)reply",
      "Seems like the survival strategy for cursor would be to develop their own frontier coding model. Maybe they can leverage the data from their still somewhat significant lead in the space to make a solid effort.reply",
      "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a viable strategy. It is very very hard and not many people can do it. Just look at how much Meta is paying to poach the few people in the world capable of training a next gen frontier model.reply",
      "Why are there actually only a few people in the world able to do this?The basic concept is out there.Lots of smart people studying hard to catch up to also be poached. No shortage of those I assume.Good trainingsdata still seems the most important to me.(and lots of hardware)Or does the specific training still involves lots of smart decisions all the time?And those small or big decisions make all the difference?reply",
      "The basic concept plus a lot of money spent on compute and training data gets you pretraining. After that to get a really good model there\u2019s a lot more fine-tuning / RL steps that companies are pretty secretive about. That is where the \u201csmart decisions\u201d and knowledge gained by training previous generations of sota models comes in.We\u2019d probably see more companies training their own models if it was cheaper, for sure. Maybe some of them would do very well. But even having a lot of money to throw at this doesn\u2019t guarantee success, e.g. Meta\u2019s Llama 4 was a big disappointment.That said, it\u2019s not impossible to catch up to close to state-of-the-art, as Deepseek showed.reply",
      "I'd recommend reading some of the papers on what it takes to actually train a proper foundation model, such as the Llama 3 Herd of Models paper. It is a deeply sophisticated process.Coding startups also try to fine-tune OSS models to their own ends. But this is also very difficult, and usually just done as a cost optimization, not as a way to get better functionality.reply",
      "1. Cost to hire is now prohibitive. You're competing against companies like Meta paying tens of millions for top talent.2. Cost to train is also prohibitive. Grok data centre has 200,000 H100 Graphics cards. Impossible for a startup to compete with this.reply",

The fuel control switches (or engine start switches) are installed on the control stand in the flight deck and used by the pilot to supply or cutoff fuel to the engines. The fuel control switch has a locking feature to prevent inadvertent operation that could result in unintended switch movement between the fuel supply and fuel cutoff positions. In order to move the switch from one position to the other under the condition where the locking feature is engaged, it is necessary for the pilot to lift the switch up while transitioning the switch position. If the locking feature is disengaged, the switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting the switch during transition, and the switch would be exposed to the potential of inadvertent operation. Inadvertent operation of the switch could result in an unintended consequence, such as an in-flight engine shutdown. Boeing informed the FAA that the fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models. The table below identifies the affected airplane models and related part numbers (P/Ns) of the fuel control switch, which is manufactured by Honeywell.> If the locking feature is disengaged, the switch can be moved between the two positions without lifting the switch during transition, and the switch would be exposed to the potential of inadvertent operation.

I really wish there was a better way to do this.There are a lot of things I don't like about C++, and close to the top of the list is the lack of standardization for name-mangling, or even a way mangle or de-mangle names at compile-time. Sepples is a royal pain in the ass to target for a dynamic FFI because of that. It would be really nice to have some way to get symbol names and calling semantics as constexpr const char* and not have to deal with generating (or writing) a ton of boilerplate and extern \"C\" blocks.It's absolutely possible, but it's not low-hanging fruit so the standards committee will never put it in. Just like they'll never add a standardized equivalent for alloca/VLAs. We're not allowed to have basic, useful things. Only more ways to abuse type deduction. Will C++26 finally give us constexpr dynamic allocations? Will compilers ever actually implement one of the three (3) compile-time reflection standards? Stay tuned to find out!reply",

      "SSD speeds are nothing short of miraculous in my mind. I come from the old days of striping 16 HDDs together (at a minimum number) to get 1GB/s throughput. Depending on the chassis, that was 2 8-drive enclosures in the \"desktop\" version or the large 4RU enclosures with redundant PSUs and fans loud enough to overpower arena rock concerts. Now, we can get 5+GB/s throughput from a tiny stick that can be used externally via a single cable for data&power that is absolutely silent. I edit 4K+ video as well, and now can edit directly from the same device the camera recorded to during production. I'm skipping over the parts of still making backups, but there's no more multi-hour copy from source media to edit media during a DIT step. I've spent many a shoot as a DIT wishing the 1s&0s would travel across devices much faster while everyone else on the production has already left, so this is much appreciated by me. Oh, and those 16 device units only came close to 4TB around the time of me finally dropping spinning rust.The first enclosure I ever dealt with was a 7-bay RAID-0 that could just barely handle AVR75 encoding from Avid. Just barely to the point that only video was saved to the array. The audio throughput would put it over the top, so audio was saved to a separate external drive.Using SSD feels like a well deserved power up from those days.reply",

NVMe is about an order of magnitude quicker than SAS and SATA.This is why I always recommend developers try using SQLite on top of NVMe storage. The performance is incredible.

      "I'm one of those astronomers! I'm working on my PhD in orbital dynamics.A lot of people are requesting discretionary time on telescopes trying to get observations in. The orbit will put us on the other side of the sun when 3I is nearest the sun in october, we can see it now and after it comes back out from behind the sun.Unfortunately, right now the it is in a very crowded star field (IE, its close to the galactic plane, lots of stars in the background).If you are interested in orbital dynamics, I have an open source rust/python package for accurate orbital calculations of asteroids/comets:https://github.com/dahlend/ketereply",
      "Cool to see! I spent a few years working on asteroid orbital dynamics too. What integrator are you using? Do you cover the weird stuff like Yarkovsky effects? That gets important for NEO impact risk, which is what I worked on.Matt Holman's ASSIST (https://github.com/matthewholman/assist) struck me as a breath of fresh air, coming from openorb and its kin.reply",
      "I wrote a custom implementation of the Radau integrator, its been heavily modified. I have a lot of additional physics, it supports the non-gravitational models that JPL Horizons defaults to, so diurnal yarkovsky at least. I've been using it to study dust and small object dynamics, as they get pushed around by the sun a lot.It does an OK job for impactors, but the integrator is tuned heavily for performance, and the tolerance defaults are not great for impactors.I match jpl horizons for apophis to a few km, they have a lot more intense earth gravitational model then I care to implement, and by default I only include the 5 heaviest main belt asteroids, they have many more. That was the sweet spot for accuracy vs speed for me, overall accuracy goal is less than a few km over a decade.The goal is to be able to handle the huge influx of new asteroids that the catalog will have due to LSST and eventually NEO Surveyor (which I worked on for 3 years). Most systems I know have been throwing hardware at the problem, I tried to make fast and efficient enough software that we can use it on a laptop for 5-10 million asteroids.reply",
      "You might want to try OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. As of last summer, we have really fancy radau methods that are arbitrary order, arbitrary tolerance (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14362 for the paper)reply",
      "That is very impressive - getting the nongravs is a lot of work.Anything published on your integrator and its modifications?One nice feature of ASSIST (from what I remember, its been a while) was that I could add in more perturbers and crank up the gravitational harmonics if I wanted to. It sounds like you support that too at least for perturbers?reply",
      "Final edits of a paper at the moment, aim to submit next week.\nPerturbers are easy to add, though a little poorly documented at the moment. Additional physics right now are J2 of jupiter/sun/earth, and GR corrections for the sun and jupiter.Biggest speed gain is that I have a custom SPICE reader that is multi-core friendly (I re-implemented a lot of the SPICE standard in rust), and it is used as the source for planet positions. Being able to skip planet integration leads to massive speedups.reply",
      "How does Kete differ from REBOUND?  (https://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)reply",
      "Different goals, kete is meant to be aimed more toward observers and telescope data processing, all asteroids and comets at once on a laptop. Short term analysis (<100 years) and speed are the priority.reply",
      "Is there a rule of thumb speed where an object is considered not from this solar system?reply",
      "Eccentricity!You can approximate the orbits of basically everything in the solar system using 2-body mechanics (IE, ignore the planets). If you do this you get orbits which are elliptical (eccentricity <1), parabolic (eccentricity = 1), or hyperbolic (eccentricity>1).If the object has an eccentricity above 1, its not bound to the solar system.Many long period comets have eccentricity hovering near 1, often these long period comets will be on their first pass (sometimes only pass) through the solar system. These comets though usually dont get much above eccentricity of 1. The 3 interstellars we have spotted have had like 1.2 or bigger. This one is above eccentricity 6! Its moving fast.Edit: I have heard that when the first interstellar was found it actually broke a lot of peoples code, as it was common to hard code limits to allowed eccentricities (or simply not support ecc>1 at all).reply"

      "Kind of a thing that isn't uniquely difficult if you've ever worked in a laptop before, hard if you've never done it.-----The ZIF connectors for those fans aren't different or much more fragile than the ones in most other laptops.The adhesives on certain cables tend to trip people up a bit with causing them to pull more than they should and damage things.Gently working under and releasing the adhesives on those fan cables with the spudger (or a fingernail) before you even start trying to move/unplug them will work a lot better for not tearing things than grabbing them with tweezers will.The TouchID cable is fragile. Still shouldn't be any serious risk of breaking if you know to treat it with caution, but that would always be the one to take the most care with and watch the most closely while you're working around it.-----The secondary challenge is pretty much just making sure you have all the cables out of the way when you're putting the board back in, because you've got a dozen or more that you need to watch the positioning of and/or tape out of the way.reply",

      "Honestly I think this is overstating things, most connectors on most laptops and phones are surprisingly robust. I've opened god knows how many laptops and phones, including some iPhones, and really those tiny ribbon cables have surprised me. Funny enough the one time I did break a ribbon cable it was actually the right joycon rail on a Nintendo Switch and it was quite an unreasonable amount of force I applied (by accident, of course...) I always smile a little seeing people on YouTube with super fine pliars carefully and tenderly taking off connectors, I usually use a butter knife or something like that to get them off and then replace them just using my finger. I actually worry more about carelessly creasing them too much rather than ripping them. Some of those things feel like they would require quite a lot of force to actually outright rip.The actual issue I have with phones isn't that the connectors/cables break apart if you look at them funny, it's actually the god damn screens are insane to deal with and replace, with all of that adhesive crap.This all to say, I think Apple is doing poorly here, their ribbon cables should probably be more robust on these often quite expensive devices.

It's a serious tradeoff to ditch the nice properties of numerical IDs and the legibility they provide in order to cargo-cult a \"we must reveal nothing\" approach, as you would here via UUID. It also misses the point of the actual security lesson: no matter the identifier, you need to be applying access controls to your data.

Least of all the American taxpayer, regardless of whether or not dismantling USAID is a good idea.If the rest of the world is so helpless that all hope depends on Americans to solve even problems such as this and it\u2019s our fault for not doing so, then I don\u2019t want to hear a peep about us taking any other actions in the world that we deem just. You can\u2019t have it both ways.reply",
      "The article makes clear that the initiative, though announced by USAID with other partners, was funded primarily by philanthropy.> The money \u2013 most of it from Open Philanthropy \u2013 will go to more than a dozen countries from Indonesia and Uganda to Ghana and Peru.From other sources, I think the US _financial_ commitment was actually pretty minimal ($4M). But if USAID had been providing important governance, administration or coordination, withdrawing its involvement could still destabilize an effort that otherwise could have been impactful.https://healthpolicy-watch.news/us-government-commits-4-mill...\"Blame\" is a loaded word. But is it really so strange to you to think that the richest and most powerful country might have some role to play in international problems that arise from comparative poverty? And that the country with the largest military in the world also should be held to a high standard in how it uses that tremendous force?If we were just some average-sized middle-income country, then no one would expect that we should play a disproportionate role in helping things at an international level, or that the use of our military is more criticized than any other. But we're big and rich and powerful and we've had some military presence in other continents pretty much continuously since WWII, and we shouldn't expect to be able to act with impunity.reply",
      "> But is it really so strange to you to think that the richest and most powerful country might have some role to play in international problems that arise from comparative poverty?I think this is a mischaracterization of parent's point. He didn't say it was strange , and he didn't say we had no role to play.> that the use of our military is more criticized than any other. But we're big and rich and powerful and we've had some military presence in other continents pretty much continuously since WWII, and we shouldn't expect to be able to act with impunityThis seems largely orthogonal to parent's point, which I would rephrase as \"We can't be police and not police at the same time. If your expectations require us to be both, they're bad expectations.\"reply",
      "Ok, so ericmay was not entirely explicit and perhaps we read his point differently.>  then I don\u2019t want to hear a peep about us taking any other actions in the world that we deem justI think the noteworthy peeps are not about the mere fact that we involve ourselves in the world outside our borders but that we often do it pretty badly. We attack Iraq with \"shock and awe\" over WMDs that do not exist, and create the Abu Ghraib prison. We drone strike weddings. We set up puppet governments ... for a while. We sign up for climate accords and then back out (multiple times).I read his point as, \"if we have an obligation to fix other people's problems, we shouldn't be subject to complaints when our foreign adventures go wrong\".And I think that's crap; we have both an obligation to try to fix the important problems that wealth or force can fix, and we have an obligation to use both carefully and ethically.> which I would rephrase as \"We can't be police and not police at the same time.To be clear, in this turmeric story, they did an ad/leaflet campaign about the issue, and then Bangladesh's own Food Safety Authority cracked down. This wasn't about the US enforcing its laws or standards anywhere else. Getting involved and helping to solve a problem doesn't need to mean being the police. And I'm not an expert, but I think almost none of the stuff that flowed through USAID was about being \"police\".reply",
      "The problem is present in America, per the article.\u2018In the early 2000s, New York City's health department noticed a perplexing blip: A surprisingly large number of Bangladeshi children in New York City were showing up in their lead database.\u2019For the cost of the research mentioned in the article, that seems a small sum to pay relative to the result achieved.\u2018Soft power\u2019 is not valued by many anymore, but cut it all and it\u2019ll be interesting to look back in a generation or two and see the result.reply",
      "Personally I do value soft power, I specifically take issue with taking away agency from other people and throwing it at the feet of the United States and saying \u201cthis is your fault and your problem to fix\u201d. It\u2019s counter productive and that\u2019s why we got rid of USAID. Enough Americans were annoyed about about these exact things. I disagree but sympathize.I\u2019m not actually sure that the juice is worth the squeeze though with respect to your first paragraph and I think you are stretching. The better argument instead is just the appeal to soft power or Conservative \u201cwe need to save the world\u201d sensibilities aka Bush Jr. and AIDS for example.reply",
      "Right, I'm 100% against the dismantling of our foreign aid programs, USAID included..However, the world playing both sides of the coin on \"US World Police\" being bad when it does stuff but also bad when it doesn't do stuff is part of how we end up where we are.It's a minuscule part of our budget, but an easy sell for right wingers to say \"well the world isn't grateful for it and its all a bunch of waste so we are killing it\" then get if not majority support, less than 50% disapproval.reply",
      "The rest of the world may think it's bad when the CIA does things, and bad when USAID doesn't do things.The nature of the thing which is being done is relevant.reply"

    "summary": "**Title: The Curious Case of the Lethal Curry Spice**\n\nIn a plot twist worthy of a subpar detective novel, NPR enlightens us on how Bangladeshi turmeric became the \"lead\" character in a global poisoning scandal due to some overly aesthetic farmers and their love for dyes. Cue the hero entrance of two American women with an X-ray gun, because apparently, the rest of the globe's 7.8 billion minds couldn't handle such \"complex\" science. Readers quickly dive into the comments to raise, lower, disregard, and then rediscover their expectations of American intervention, all the while earnestly ignoring the local efforts detailed in the article.
