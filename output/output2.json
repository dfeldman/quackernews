      "I relate heavily to the author's dilemma. My projects span from math, to programming, to pinball repair, to amateur radio, to gardening, to mycology, to who knows what else. I personally enjoy the process of bike-shedding and endlessly exploring the solution space for a problem. That said, there is a point where you need to make hard decisions and button up projects.As long as I don't care what project gets completed at what time, I've found a little trick to broadly move the needle. I jokingly call it \"Sol's fast five\" but the name is actually pretty on point.I take a step back, look around me, and pick out the first five things I can reasonably achieve in less then a day prioritizing things where I have all the tools and materials at hand. These 5 things are never entire projects, the goal is to maximally decompose the projects until each action is as close to trivial as possible.Once I have my list of 5 things I stop thinking about anything else and strictly work towards those 5 goals. There is a sense of relief in having reduced the scope and the tasks tend to be finished very quickly. Checking them off the list always feels good.Once I have completed my 5 items I start a new list and pick out the next five items. This can feel like a huge reward.I've used this system to great effect in the past few years.\n \nreply",
      "Your interests sound similar to mine. My email is in my profile if you ever care to compare notes.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks!\n \nreply",
      "would the five tasks be a single project or across multiple?\n \nreply",
      "It depends on the circumstances and how you want to prioritize things. Generally I'll take on the 5 easiest tasks across all my 'active' projects.\n \nreply",
      "I think it's worth differentiating between personal projects done to learn or just for interest, and those that are trying to accomplish something. If I do a project for myself to try things out and learn something I don't feel any pressure to finish the project. Once I've learned something or had some fun, who cares if it's \"finished\" or if anyone else will use it. On the other hand, sometimes I'll pick up something interesting that helps a friend or family member, or just that I need for myself, and there I'm pretty careful about scope. If I can't finish it in a couple weekends I'll look for the closest commercial solution unless it's a major once-in-a-decade passion project.\n \nreply",
      "I used to find myself under the effects of this curse as well, so I would recommend the author look into why he embarks on such a thicket of unfinished side projects. In my own case, it boiled down to a mix of several imperfectly aligned factors:1. Genuine intellectual interest2. A desire to improve particular skills3. A vague sense, acquired by osmosis, that industriously working on side projects during one's free time is what a Real Engineer doesDisentangling these motives and identifying a clear primary drive behind each project clears up the \"hydra\" feeling wonderfully, as most of the heads simply disappear once you realize that you never had a strong reason to pursue them in the first place. (3) in particular is often merely the self-castigating whisper of the internalized \"should\" rather than a valid reason to embark on a long and open-ended project.\n \nreply",

The mind gets into a single track and wants to continue.Fun but also exhausting.So I stopped all that.

      "I've visited all the links and honestly still don't have the slightest idea what this input method does, or exactly what problem it's trying to solve, or why it's a good solution to the problem. I found the video [1] but it has no audio or explanations at all.I also don't understand why you'd want phonetic input methods, rather than wanting to input your desired character directly. For languages like Chinese I understand because there are thousands of characters, but aren't most or all African writing systems based on small alphabets? I shudder to think of having to learn to input English phonetically.So if you're looking for opinions, my first one is that your pages need to do a better job at explaining what current problems are (with multiple clear examples for each), where current solutions fail (with clear examples of how), and how your solution is different and better (again, with clear examples).Good luck![1] https://github.com/pythonbrad/afrim-keyboard/?tab=readme-ov-...\n \nreply",
      "> I also don't understand why you'd want phonetic input methodsI'm from Morocco, and most people here (myself included) are accustomed to typing on an AZERTY (or QWERTY) keyboard. Typing in Arabic using a standard keyboard layout can be quite cumbersome and slow for us (Most people never took the time to learn it), using latin alphabet for us is just more practical, and doesn't require you to learn a new way to type.In our daily communication, when we text, whether with friends or family, we often switch between English, French, or Moroccan dialects. When writing in Moroccan dialect, we frequently use a phonetic system (read in french way) that combines the Latin alphabet with numbers to represent specific sounds or letters that don\u2019t have a direct equivalent in the Latin script.For example:    \u0642 is replaced by \"q\"\n    \u0639 is replaced by \"3\"\n    \u062e is replaced by \"5\" (though \"kh\" is more common)\n    \u063a is replaced by \"4\" (or \"gh\")\n    The rest is just a 1 to 1 conversion to how the letter sounds in french\n    \nExample phrase :Bro, I woke up and had a sick breakfast.Sat, 3ad fe9t o drabt wa7d ftor khatir.\n \nreply",

In the morning I'd try the problems again first thing after coffee, and frequently found that I could do a significant portion of the problems, or at least make headway.

Meanwhile they can play on a sandbox environment.It's also doable in fully automated fashion, but you will have to have strong identity and payment verifications, to avoid DoS, and in those cases usually contracts fly around.That's for the b2b side.For b2c, usually you rely on a single db and filter by column ID or similar, which can easily be abstracted away.\n \nreply",

I can't believe they are thefts out there paying other thefts for theft-services...Unrelated, but at the start of the year, a lot of Payoneer customers from Argentina lost their savings in the platform* due to someone having access to the OTP codes. Payoneer said it wasn't on their side the error, and evidence suggested that it was an error in Movistar, because all the victims were customers of that particular telco. As far as I know, Payoneer didn't return the money and Movistar was never charged or anything (rumours say it was a Movistar employee who sold SMS with the OTP).And if you ask why a lot of Argentina people use Payoneer and keep their savings there, it's a bit long to explain but basically is their way to get paid in USD outside the country without paying taxes (fair and unfair ones) and without getting their payments converted automatically to ARS pesos using a bad rate.\n \nreply",

Even the open source tooling is far more sophisticated that most people reading this realize, and that constitutes the baseline, not the top end.

      "> generally the RSS and ATOM feeds for any blog, are limited in two ways;> 1. [limited history of posts]> 2. [partial content]To fix the limitation N\u00b01 on some cases, maybe the author can rely on sitemaps [1], is a feature present in many sites (as RSS feeds) and it shows all the pages published.[1] https://www.sitemaps.org/\n \nreply",
      "Similar goal, different approach. I wrote RSS reader, that captures link meta from various RSS sources. The meta data are exported every day. I have different repositories for bookmarks, different for daily links, different for 'known domains'.Written in Django.I can always go back, parse saved data. If web page is not available, I fall back to Internet Archive.- https://github.com/rumca-js/Django-link-archive - RSS reader / web scraper- https://github.com/rumca-js/RSS-Link-Database - bookmarks I found interesting- https://github.com/rumca-js/RSS-Link-Database-2024 - every day storage- https://github.com/rumca-js/Internet-Places-Database - internet domains found on the internetAfter creating python package for web communication, that replaces requests for me, which uses sometimes selenium I wrote also CLI interface to read RSS sources from commandline: https://github.com/rumca-js/yafr\n \nreply",
      "Looks like a nice tool for extending existing RSS sources. As for the sites that don't have RSS support in the first place, there is also RSSHub [1]. Sadly, you can't use both for the same source: history4feed's trick with the Wayback Machine wouldn't work with the RSSHub feed.[1] https://rsshub.app/\n \nreply",
      "It's so clever to just pull from Wayback Machine rather than scrape the site itself. Never even thought of that\n \nreply",
      "Before building an app that depends on the Wayback Machine (or other Archive infrastructure) it's good to keep in mind this post from their blog: <https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/29/let-us-serve-you-but-don...>One of my favorite tricks when coming across a blog with a longtail of past posts is to verify that it's hosted on WordPress and then to ingest the archives into my feedreader.Once you have the WordPress feed URL, you can slurp it all in by appending `?paged=n` (or `&paged=n`) for the nth page of the feed. (This is a little tedious in Thunderbird; up till now I've generated a list of URLs and dragged and dropped each one into the subscribe-to-feed dialog. The whole process is amenable to scripting by bookmarklet, though\u2014gesture at a blog with the appropriate metadata, and then get a file that's one big RSS/Atom container with every blog post.)\n \nreply",
      "I used it to recover some lost content from my blog a few years ago, it was fantastic: https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/8/missing-content/\n \nreply",
      "This reminds me of something I wrote in early 2000. At that time RSS was less than a year old and if I'm honest I wasn't aware of it at all. I wrote a short PHP script to get the HTML of each site in a list, do a diff against the most recent snapshot, and generate a web page with a table containing all the changes. I could set per site thresholds for change value to cope with small dynamic content like dates and exclude certain latger sections of content via regexp. I probably still have the code in my backups from the dot com boom job I had at the time.\n \nreply",
      "I wrote a similar tool [1], although it's designed to let you gradually catch up on a backlog rather than write a full feed all at once. Right now it only works on Blogger and WordPress blogs, so I'll need to learn from their trick of pulling from Internet Archive.[1] https://github.com/steadmon/blog-replay\n \nreply",
      "I had a similar idea to replay blogs. It'll pull from WordPress or Internet Archive and give you a replay link to add to your feed reader.https://refeed.to\n \nreply",
      "The mystical creature - the URL - is a link to a resource that doesn't have to be static, it's only the URL that is static. eg. the content might change. So you might want to have the program revisit the resource once in a while to see if there are updates.\n \nreply"

    "summary": "**Hacker News Reboots the RSS Wheel**\n\nToday on Hacker News, an intrepid user pitches the revolutionary concept of ***\"Full Text, Full Archive RSS Feeds\"*** that miraculously solve problems no one realized still existed. In comments, a parade of hobbyist archivists, proudly bearing their GitHub repos like Olympic medals, outbid each other with tales of scraping, archiving, and generally rescuing the world's knowledge from imminent digital decay. Meanwhile, strategic commenters provide throwback to early 2000 DIY scripts, reminiscing the golden age of PHP like it\u2019s vintage wine. Surely, civilization teeters on the fragile axis of blog post retrieval \u2013 brace yourselves, history is being rewritten one feed at a time. \ud83d\udcdc\ud83d\udd27\ud83d\ude02"
