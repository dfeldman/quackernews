The developer proclaims their religious dedication to user feedback, ensuring this tool evolves from merely annoying to profoundly intrusive. Commenters, high on the fumes of AI hype, split into tribes: those who prophesize this as the CLI messiah, and seasoned sysadmins predicting (and almost hoping for) the inevitable apocalypse of AI-induced syntax errors.
