      "> Wick started his talk by saying that it looks like everything is great with the Flatpak project, but if one looks deeper, \"\"you will notice that it's not being actively developed anymore\"\". There are people who maintain the code base and fix security issues, for example, but \"\"bigger changes are not really happening anymore\"\". He said that there are a bunch of merge requests for new features, but no one feels responsible for reviewing them, and that is kind of problematic.I think Red Hat should really be stepping up more here, especially since with RHEL 10 they stopped maintaining a ton of desktop packages with the advice for users of those packages being \"get the package on Flathub instead of from us\" (see https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_... , search for Flathub). If that's Red Hat's attitude towards desktop software, they should be providing the resources to make Flatpak a viable alternative.> A user's Linux distribution may still be providing an older version of Flatpak that does not have support for --device=input, or whatever new feature that a Flatpak developer may wish to use. Wick said there needs to be a way for applications to use the new permissions by default, but fall back to the older permission models if used on a system with an older version of Flatpak.I'm glad he brought that up as a problem. I maintain a game on Flathub that has audio and controller support. Because of the limited permissions granularity, that means that the game is displayed as requiring arbitrary device access (--device=input is too new, so the Flathub maintainers don't allow it in packages yet) and being able to listen to your device's microphone (the audio permission doesn't allow only accessing speakers but not microphones). I hope that Flatpak adds backwards compatibility for permissions so newer Flatpak versions can start having more granular permissions.\n \nreply",
      "Red Hat has since walked some of this back. Firefox and Thunderbird were supposed to go Flatpak only for RHEL 10, but they eventually shipped rpms for GA.Seems there were a myriad of causes for this including lack of Native Messaging, no ability to deploy policies centrally, and broken integrations with various other parts of the desktop ecosystem.\n \nreply",
      "The permissions issues are real.It still isn't possible to package Tailscale or anything that creates a virtual interface as a Flatpak because there is no permission for that. macOS has an API to ask for permissions to add an interface/change routes.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks to said API, Tailscale on MacOS is even distributed as a sandboxed app through the Mac App Store [1]. Flatpak's restrictions make certain classes of software difficult to use on \"atomic\" Linux distros like Silverblue or Bluefin that provide a read-only base system and expect users to get their software through Flatpak.[1] https://tailscale.com/kb/1016/install-mac\n \nreply",
      "Nice breakdown. I'm new to Linux and didn't know about this:> Flatpak still uses PulseAudio even if a host system uses PipeWire. The problem with that is that PulseAudio bundles together access to speakers and microphones\u2014you can have access to both, or neither, but not just one. So if an application has access to play sound, it also has access to capture audioThat's a pretty decent sized hole.\n \nreply",
      "It's too complex. An application format shouldn't need to rely on 5 different APIs to be secure. And the apps aren't portable. I think something like WebAssembly is going to be the way forward.\n \nreply",
      "Drat. Does this mean Fedora is hosed? I don't really follow metastories on Linux...\n \nreply",
      "it was really for cross-distro GUI desktop applications. I saw it's used in embedded linux projects that has no GUI, for its portability at a heavy price(flatpak is quite fat, it needs to install a full sandbox)\n \nreply",
      "I chose flatpak some time ago over snaps for gui apps and I don't remember why. I think there are benefits to packaging software this way (especially for immutable OS images) but at the same time there are so many negatives too. I hope they make it more of a priority. Or something better comes out on top.\n \nreply",
      "Hopefully the money from selling apps can fund development like other app stores work.\n \nreply"

A LLM is smart enough to understand this from the words and the relationship between them. But then comes the \"generative\" part. It will recall from its dataset situations with the same elements.So: an AI threatened of being turned off, a blackmail opportunity... Doesn't it remind you of hundreds of sci-fi story, essays about the risks of AI, etc...

A product that's designed to strip ads from content for readability doesn't align with their new direction.I'd probably be applauding the decision to shut this down if I thought they were doing it to free up resources to increase their focus on the browser, but Mozilla seems to be institutionally committed to chasing its own demise, so I'm sure they will instead focus on AI integration and other stuff that nobody asked for.Meanwhile, Firefox is still missing proper support for a bunch of modern web features like view transitions and CSS anchor points that are available in every other browser.\n \nreply",

The style the author presents is vivid, uses powerful imagery and metaphor and finally, at times, is genuinely funny.

      "Maybe he meant it was long. Some people seem to think that long walls of text is how you spot AI slop.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, and the article talks about those ways in which AI is useful. Overall, the author doesn\u2019t have a problem with experts using AI to help them. The main argument is that we\u2019re calling AI a copilot, and many newbies may be trusting it or leaning on it too much, when in reality, it\u2019s still a shitty coworker half the time. Real copilots are actually your peers and experts at what they do.> Now? We\u2019re building a world where that curiosity gets lobotomized at the door. Some poor bastard\u2014born to be great\u2014is going to get told to \"review this AI-generated patchset\" for eight hours a day, until all that wonder calcifies into apathy. The terminal will become a spreadsheet. The debugger a coffin.On the other hand, one could argue that AI is just another abstraction. After all, some folks may complain that over-reliance on garbage collectors means that newbies never learn how to properly manage memory. While memory management is useful knowledge for most programmers, it rarely practically comes up for many modern professional tasks. That said, at least knowing about it means you have a deeper level of understanding and mastery of programming. Over time, all those small, rare details add up, and you may become an expert.I think AI is in a different class because it\u2019s an extremely leaky abstraction.We use many abstractions every day. A web developer really doesn\u2019t need to know how deeper levels of the stack work \u2014 the abstractions are very strong. Sure, you\u2019ll want to know about networking and how browsers work to operate at a very high level, but you can absolutely write very nice, scalable websites and products with more limited knowledge. The key thing is that you know what you\u2019re building on, and you know where to go learn about things if you need to. (Kind of like how a web developer should know the fundamental basics of HTML/CSS/JS before really using a web framework. And that doesn\u2019t take much effort.)AI is different \u2014 you can potentially get away with not knowing the fundamental basics of programming\u2026 to a point. You can get away with not knowing where to look for answers and how to learn. After all, AIs would be fucking great at completing basic programming assignments at the college level.But at some point, the abstraction gets very leaky. Your code will break in unexpected ways. And the core worry for many is that fewer and fewer new developers will be learning the debugging, thinking, and self-learning skills which are honestly CRITICAL to becoming an expert in this field.You get skills like that by doing things yourself and banging your head against the wall and trying again until it works, and by being exposed to a wide variety of projects and challenges. Honestly, that\u2019s just how learning works \u2014 repetition and practice!But if we\u2019re abstracting away the very act of learning, it is fair to wonder how much that will hurt the long-term skills of many developers.Of course, I\u2019m not saying AI causes everyone to become clueless. There are still smart, driven people who will pick up core skills along the way. But it seems pretty plausible that the % of people who do that will decrease. You don\u2019t get those skills unless you\u2019re challenged, and with AI, those beginner level \u201clearn how to program\u201d challenges become trivial. Which means people will have to challenge themselves.And ultimately, the abstraction is just leaky. AI might look like it solves your problems for you to a novice, but once you see through the mirage, you realize that you cannot abstract away your core programming & debugging skills. You actually have to rely on those skills to fix the issues AI creates for you \u2014 so you better be learning them along the way!!Btw, I say this as someone who does use AI coding assistants.

      "Is soaking the dice even necessary?A na\u00efvely constructed die - i.e. a perfect cube, but with pips dug out for each face - will already bias in favor of 6 rolls and away from 1 rolls simply because six pips require removing more material (and therefore mass) than one pip.  Likewise with 5/2 and 4/3.  The \"precision\" dice used in e.g. casinos address this by filling in the pips with material exactly as dense as the die's base material; the injection-molded dice in most board games (let alone wooden dice) obviously ain't constructed with that level of care.This is also part of the reason why some dice games - particularly those typically played with cheap dice - deem 1 to be more valuable than 6 (example: Farkle) or require at least one 1 roll to win (example: 1-4-24).

To load these dice, I placed them in a small plate of water overnight, leaving the 6 side exposed.The submerged area absorbed water, becoming heavier.

Meanwhile, the commentariat, armed with the distant wisdom of 20th-century computing heroes and their dusty Fortran manuals, lament over modern coders' inability to keep up with the rigid dance of set.seed(). If you thought <i>numerical stability</i> was about balancing your checkbook, you're in for a world of disappointment and complex conjugates. Keep your NaNs to yourself, folks\u2014apparently, we've been doing it wrong this whole time. \ud83c\udfb2\ud83d\udc94"

      "I come from the times where winamp was the go-to music player. \nToday, even in the age of streaming services I still keep a local music library organized in folders. So, just as others here in the comments I built myself an old-school music player as a hobby project to listen to my music offline. It's a 1 page html/js app, has full keyboard controls and also features a simple queue mechanism functionality\nCheck it out: https://nobsutils.com/mp\n \nreply",
      "To me the go-to music player has always been foobar2000. (Replaced today by Cog app)\n \nreply",
      "2025 and im still rockin foobar2000 with 2000 plugins. wish a native linux binary was out though through wine is okay, just lacks native dark mode\n \nreply",
      "I built my own web app to listen to full albums while allowing me to take breaks and switch devices. I really like to listen to albums from front to back but I found that at least YouTube Music doesn't remember playback position and you can't just switch devices without pulling up the album again on the other device and finding the position where you left off. My web app lets me paste a URL that is then downloaded to the server using yt-dlp and can be streamed from there. It always remembers playback position so I can listen from the phone in my car and then continue on the laptop at work from where I left off. It also works great for adding mixes from other sources such as NTS Radio - one of my favorites.\n \nreply",
      "You've just described one of my biggest frustrations with YouTube Music, wishing I could save queues and switch devices more seamlessly.Would love to take a look at your web app if it's available\n \nreply",
      "I still use the Apple Music app with my own local files.I turned off Apple Music (the steaming service), loaded everything into Apple Music (the app on macOS). I then plugged my phone into my laptop like it was 2007 and synced it over like an iPod. Everything works as expected. My music doesn\u2019t change so much, so syncing hasn\u2019t been an issue. I get a certain hit of nostalgia when syncing over the wire as well.\n \nreply",
      "People will literally build their own music apps instead of switching to Android. Is it just for the blue bubbles, or because of how everything \"just works\" (unless you want to play offline music)?\n \nreply",
      "I made a prototype of a music player for iOS, since the VLC app cannot reliably parse metadata of FLACs stored on my file server. I cannot store my whole music collection on my device, due to storage limitations.My app is a prototype in the sense that I want more features, but the app has just enough functionality that I lack motivation to implement more features. Currently has audio playback, remote file access, and FLAC metadata parsing. Similar to the author, I originally wanted to use React Native because I have experience with it and already maintain a few React Native applications. However, I am not interested in targetting (or debugging) other platforms. So I decided to try using SwiftUI and used a special tool[1] to get something resembling hot reloading. (It's kind of a gross hack that requires supplying custom linker flags in Xcode, but it works just enough for me to not miss the DX of TypeScript and React Native).[1] https://github.com/johnno1962/InjectionIII\n \nreply",
      "You really would move to a different country just because they have better bread?What's the problem with baking your own?\n \nreply",
      "It's more akin to moving to a different country because this one mandates which bread you will eat and how you will eat it. A mighty fine reason to emigrate.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "In 2025, playing your own music on an iPhone is surprisingly hard, unless you pay Apple or navigate a maze of limitations. So I built my own player from scratch, with full text search, iCloud support, and a local-first experience. GitHub linkLike many people, I\u2019ve picked up too many subscriptions, some through Apple (iCloud, Apple Music), others got lost in random platforms (like Netflix, which I forgot I was still paying for). I actually used Apple Music regularly (and previously Spotify), but the streaming turned out to be more convenience than necessity. With a curated local library, I didn\u2019t lose much, just the lock-in.Initially I thought, I\u2019d just keep using iCloud Music Library for cross-device music synchronization, but once I cancelled the Apple Music subscription, the sync stopped working. Turns out this feature is behind a paywall. You can technically get it back via iTunes Match ($24.99/year). Match just stores 256-kbps AAC copies online; your original files stay put unless ",
    "summary": "**Hacker News Resurrects Winamp: The Musical Necromancy Edition**\n\nIn an unsurprising turn of events, a lone hero defies the draconian ecosystem of Apple by re-inventing the wheel, or in this case, a music player. Because in 2025, why accept the streamlined luxury of streaming services when you can flex your software muscles to create what essentially amounts to a Winamp skin with cloud storage? Hobbyists chime in with tales of their own Frankenstein players, stitched together from the spare parts of obsolete tech and nostalgia. Threads devolve into tech-luddites mourning the good old days, comparing GitHub stars, and subtly flexing their refusal to switch to Android because they might lose precious iMessage blue bubbles and have to interact with \"green text\" peasants. \ud83d\udc74\ud83c\udfb5\ud83d\udcbe"
