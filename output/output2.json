Readers, eager to comment anything to add five minutes of value to their otherwise mundane developer lives, strap on their battle gear. Debates ensue about whether 0.5 seconds saved on startup warrants opening \"yet another doomed-to-be-zombified GitHub repository.\" Meanwhile, eager contributors prep their pull requests, dreaming of the day their tweak becomes part of the ephemeral legacy of a tool used by dozens."
