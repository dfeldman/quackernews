      "After following the literature down several different rabbit holes, I found this argument in some of the supplementary figures on that tree that seems to address your question:> \"Supplementary Note 1 | Advantages of PEC hydrocarbon synthesis.\"In general, PEC systems have the potential to combine the performance of wired PV-electrolysis (PV-E) systems with the simplicity of photocatalytic (PC) systems. PV-E is an established technology, which can take advantage of commercial solar cell modules with light harvesting efficiencies above 20% 24 and state-of-the-art gas diffusion electrolysers operating at high current densities above 1 A cm-2.25 However, PV-E assemblies require additional components including reactors, membranes, pumps, corrosive electrolytes, external cables and control electronics, increasing the overall system complexity and associated cost.26,27\"\"On the other hand, PC powders provide an inexpensive alternative to PV-E, since light absorber particles and any necessary catalysts are dispersed in solution, which greatly minimises the overall system complexity. However, wide band gaps and charge recombination often limits solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies to below 1%.28 While a homogeneous dispersion of the light absorber and catalyst can increase reactivity, this also poses challenges for the subsequent separation of all components and products from the reaction mixture.\"\"Accordingly, PEC artificial leaves provide a balance between PV-E and PC approaches in terms of complexity, cost and performance, by integrating state-of-the-art semiconductors and catalysts into a single compact panel. These PEC devices can perform reactions beyond water splitting (e.g., CO2 reduction to C1 products, or the light-driven C2 hydrocarbon and organic synthesis introduced here), while allowing product separation between the anodic and cathodic sides. This intrinsic design advantage is demonstrated by lightweight PEC systems using 15-fold less material than conventional solar panels, which combine the high performance of wired systems with the high activity per gram of photocatalyst nanoparticles.29 This applicability and potential of PEC-based fuel production also translates to hydrocarbon synthesis. In addition, direct light-driven hydrocarbon synthesis is carbon neutral, avoiding the energy-intensive Fischer-Tropsch process for indirect hydrocarbon synthesis from syngas (H2 + CO).\"Practically speaking the catalysts in these processes have relatively short lifetimes, so you'd want to incorporate an efficient catalyst regeneration process into the production pipeline, i.e. you might only get 16-128 hours of efficient production before catalyst regeneration is required so that needs to be built into any commercial process.  So if you can design a catalyst that's easy to regenerate, that's very important.Source material with nice pictures of the copper nanoflowers:https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs419...\n \nreply",
      "Efficiency is likely much lower than solar panels, however, solar panels are expensive and complicated (chemically) to manufacture. Teaching plans to make stuff for us is a better long term solution as we can just grow the plants.\n \nreply"

      "Google does have a nearly impossible task making Maps work around the world, and I think it does an admirable job. One just has to have a bit of local knowledge to work around the quirks. For example, the walking directions Maps gives for Singapore are almost always ridiculous. They're almost always twice the distance they need to be, since it's very common to cut through the open lower floor (void deck) of apartment buildings (HDB blocks) to get anywhere on foot here. I typically use the walking directions to get a bearing, point the compass pointer toward the destination, and start walking. The same thing goes for directions on the expressways here. If I wait for Maps to tell me to exit, I'm already at or past the exit. I basically have to already kind of know where I'm going to make use of driving directions. Never mind that there are actual bugs in the directions (at one spot, if I need to exit onto the MCE from the AYE, it tells me to exit onto the AYE, which is incorrect).

      "I noticed this the other day when I installed VSCodium on my new Windows box. I had a functional setup for one day, then the next day I couldn't install a language extension I direly needed.It's left a very sour taste in my mouth. I've used Emacs for ages and despite being a much more niche editor, it's never been so hard-dependent on centralized repositories, and the centralized repositories it does have (ELPA/MELPA) are apparently a lot more reliable than OpenVSX. Installing Emacs packages manually from source is a breeze, doing so with VSC is masochistic.VSC is not really \"open source\" in any meaningful sense. It is just plainly unusable if you don't do things the way Microsoft wants you to. I do respect the VSCodium devs for trying to make VSC more properly open, but it does feel like a futile effort.\n \nreply",
      "I feel that you're conflating few concepts, hackability, \"open source\", single point of failure architectures.Yes, VSC is less hackable than emacs, but I don't think it's necessarily the same thing. VSC (and others like it) are going for a more streamlined \"App Store\" experience, while emacs is going for a more DIY/hackable style editor.\nYou can always fetching the VSIX file and sideload it is if the \"store\" is down though.Yes, VSC is less \"open source\" than emacs. if \"open sourceness\" is a score out of 10 or something. Pretty sure RMS would argue linux is less \"open source\" than emacs too.Not sure why this is futile for the VSCodium devs. They are taking a dependency on a service for installing extensions. The solutions is more readonly mirrors for the official OpenVSX endpoint.If your main archlinux mirror is down, you don't cry about the centralized state of our life. You use a different mirror. You throw in 5 or 10 in case one or two are down. I understand why a company like Microsoft might want a more centralized service to distribute the extensions. But for an open source clone? is Microsoft also expected to create the mirror clone?\n \nreply",
      "My point about VSC is that brands itself as \"open source\" when Microsoft clearly intends for it to have a proprietary, tightly controlled ecosystem. It's not just RMS-unapproved, it's practically a lie. You can use it as a FOSS editor, but only if you are willing to accept a vastly subpar experience. Oh, and they've started cracking down on people using their proprietary VSC plugins in derived editors, too.I expected it to be a little less convenient to leave Microsoft's beaten path. I did not expect it to be a massive waste of time. This is what I meant by futile. Not only is it apparently very brittle, it's missing large swaths of VSC's ecosystem. Hell, I don't even know if the extension I wanted is available on OpenVSX because it's still down!If Microsoft hadn't openwashed their product, I wouldn't care nearly as much.Besides, Emacs still provides a streamlined system for managing packages on top of being hackable. It even makes installing and upgrading packages straight from a Git repo easy. Sometimes you can have your cake and eat it too.\n \nreply",
      "Exactly this.For me, the C/C++ language pack stopped working overnight with Cursor. This was clearly because of commercial concerns about derivative IDEs fairly and squarely gaining traction over the original product. But it broke my workflow a couple hours before a meeting.I use neovim with LSPs and this is unimaginable in my world. I have started using IDEs only because the productivity gains from better LLM integration are undeniable. Sure I moved to clangd in Cursor and it was all fine, but the IDE actively pushes you to install Microsoft extensions, that can be yanked off whenever some Msft PM decides \"oh we didn't actually want our competitors to be making money\".LLVM/GCC/Neovim/Apache projects are open-source. Anything that is \"open-source until it is not\" is not open source, and this perfectly describes VSCode today.\n \nreply",
      "> is Microsoft also expected to create the mirror clone?Allowing open source VS Code (ie. VS Code you compiled from Microsoft\u2019s repo) to access extensions would be enough. Nobody is asking Microsoft for more than basic access. It\u2019s does not even require a code changes, just a policy change.Even Google allows Chrome forks to access the Chrome Store.\n \nreply",
      "For context, Open VSX is run by the Eclipse foundation, which also develops the Eclipse Theia editor, which is basically a clone of VS Code (not a fork, like VS Codium).The Open VSX registry is open source (https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx) and self-hostable, although I have no experience with that. I assume it's possible to host your own instance with the extensions you want instead of relying on the free public instance.Personally I'm more of a Sublime guy, but people looking for an open VSC alternative should consider Theia over VSC forks. It seems like the smarter long term investment if you want to get out from Microsoft's control.\n \nreply",
      "It\u2019s plenty open source \u2014 that is why all these forks exist!VS Code itself does not work without various propriety stuff, but that is a different thing. A large number of open-source projects work that way. If you don\u2019t like the proprietary stuff, the recourse is to fork it, modify it, and implement the remaining stuff yourself.\n \nreply",
      "You can always clone the extensions repo and build locally. Should take 10 minutes at mostI\u2019m not sure how this could actually work without a centralized repo.If I\u2019m going to use VSCode I\u2019ll just use it, I don\u2019t need to play with forks, etc\n \nreply",

      "For those who feel weird about the whole \"forbidden transitions being only possible with quantum tunneling\" thing and want an alternative interpretation:It's only true that the transitions are forbidden under a given simplified model of the atom. It is very much possible to calculate the transition probabilities under a more realistic model, and the previously \"forbidden\" transitions are now just regular transitions that occur with lower probability.In this case, the simplified model is that of the electric dipole approximation, where the atom is taken to be an electric dipole (reasonable when the wavelength of light emitted during an atomic transition is much larger than the size of the atom).This means it interacts with electromagnetic radiation only through electric dipole interactions, which implies that energy transitions must change orbital angular momentum, hence the 21cm transition is \"forbidden\". However, in reality, the atom is not truly an electric dipole, and so the 21cm transition is possible by the magnetic dipole interaction, just with low probability. (This low probability is due to the relative strength of the magnetic interaction compared to the electric interaction).\n \nreply",
      "I've never liked the definition of forbidden transitions as \"transitions not predicted under the broader approximation\", because its rare that anybody actually lays out why a given approximation is used, and therefore why that approximation is inappropriate for the \"forbidden\" situation.The reality is that with e.g. 21 cm Hydrogen, or 500.7 nm Oxygen (which I knew by heart, back in the day), its hard to keep a given atom in the appropriate state long enough for it to relax by emitting the appropriate photon. Indeed, we can't create a pure enough vacuum in a large enough chamber that such things happen frequently enough to be measurable.\n \nreply",

In this case, the spacecraft could break, but we can assume quantum transitions will always be observable.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque\n \nreply",
      "I sarcastically referenced the plaque itself, which is a convenient disc of a known size to anyone observing the drawing, unlike the space craft or physics riddles.Using quantum transitions is quite ridiculous in my opinion due to requiring not only the observer to have a perfectly compatible understanding of physics (even a more advanced understanding might not be compatible - maybe they don't categorize elements by electrons, or even treat elemental particles as a quantifiable entity), combined with the sheer number of deductions required to understand what was meant with two circles and a few lines.I doubt we would ever have decoded this had we been the recipient rather than author, and that's with a perfectly compatible understanding of physics.\n \nreply",
      "If we picked up that plaque from space with an illustration of some aliens and an alien solar system and someone Tweeted it, the correct hypothesis for the numbering would develop plurality consensus within one hour.I don't know if aliens would decode it but it's not right that humans wouldn't decode it.\n \nreply",
      "I submit that if the concept of quantum transitions is alien to whatever recipient of that probe (if ever), then any attempts to communicate are hopeless anyway. That is, if the recipient's physical reality is so different from our own that they can't at least get back to \"oh, this distance means that transition, now the rest of the plaque makes sense\", then no asynchronous communication will bridge that gap.\n \nreply",
      "There is no relation between the ability to communicate and a shared understanding of our concept of quantum transitions - case in point, our invention of the technology we use to communicate with deep space far predates us learning these concepts ourselves.I'd also hold that the only thing this plaque could ever give is clear sign of artificial creation, and by virtue the (possibly past) existence of some entity capable of creating it. Maybe they'll get a vague idea of what we look like, but if \"their\" culture does not commonly depict themselves in 2D as we do, or \"they\" have vastly different morphologies, even that would be unclear.

Speedrun ad-hoc queries as you typeLearn More2025/04/23 - 8 min readToday, we\u2019re releasing Instant SQL, a new way to write SQL that updates your result set as you type to expedite query building and debugging \u2013 all with zero-latency, no run button required. Instant SQL is now available in MotherDuck and the DuckDB Local UI.We built Instant SQL for a simple reason: writing SQL is still too tedious and slow. Not because of the language itself, but because the way we interact with databases hasn\u2019t evolved much since SQL was created. Writing SQL isn\u2019t just about syntax - It\u2019s about making sense of your data, knowing what to ask, and figuring out how to get there. That process is iterative, and it\u2019s hard.\"Instant SQL will save me the misery of having to try and wrangle SQL in my BI tool where iteration speed can be very slow. This lets me get the data right earlier in the process, with faster feedback than waiting for a chart to render or clearing an analytics cache.\"\n-",

Their revolutionary feature allows you to see just how wrong your SQL query is going, milliseconds after you type it. Because why wait to discover your mistakes when you can know about them *instantly*? Meanwhile, the comment section explodes with adoration for Hamilton, the newfound hero of the database world, while others wish for SQL to adopt pipe syntax, as if rearranging the chairs on the Titanic would prevent it from sinking.

      "For the input, we pass the model: 1) embedded audio and 2) a single image (encoded with a causal VAE). The model outputs the final RGB video directly.The key technical unlock was getting the model to generate a video faster than real-time. This allows us to stream video directly to the user. We do this by recursively generating the video, always using the last few frames of the previous output to condition the next output. We have some tricks to make sure the video stays relatively stable even with recursion.\n \nreply",

From the website: \"Personal RTX 4090 generates at speed 2.5 seconds/frame (unoptimized) or 1.5 seconds/frame (teacache).\" That means it would take them 37.5s to generate 1 second of video, which is fast for video but way slower than real time.\n \nreply",

Maybe its just me, but if I'm writing to a blog or a microblog I just don't really care who follows me or even who reads it.There are more social features built into ActivityPub, likes and shares for example, but at that point I'm likely not running my own server and am trusting a third party to do it for me. The idea that there are multiple hosts I can choose to trust rather than one centralized one feels more like a principled argument than one based on real benefits of, for example, owning my own content or censorship resistance.\n \nreply",
      "> if I'm writing to a blog or a microblog I just don't really care who follows me or even who reads it.- if you want to have comments or backtracks, you can do it with ActivityPub without having people signing up to your site (directly or through some OAuth system)- If you want to mitigate spam, you can set up your AP blog to only accept messages on the inbox from actors who you whitelist.- You could have your own Substack where you only send the updates to actors who are paying subscribers.\n \nreply",

      "Webmentions are a spammer's wet dream. There is a reason they were adopted only by the Indieweb crowd.Anyway, my point was less \"ActivityPub can do everything people can do with RSS\" and more \"having a mechanism to for bidirectional authenticated messages opens up the possibility of new applications\".The real interesting part will happen when/if more developers realize that ActivityPub can do more than \"federated versions of popular social media platforms\".\n \nreply",
      "Spammers would have to host a page (permanently) that links to your post, and even then they don't get to control what (if anything) from that page gets displayed on your site.I guess one danger is that they only serve the page that contains your link to the webmention-validating request. That way they get a backlink but don't have to keep a public outgoing link. They'd have to know that a given request is that validation though, and I'm not sure that'd be very easy.\n \nreply",
      "I might be misunderstanding what you're saying here. How is ActivityPub more authenticated than Webmention? WM requires the poster to host their content on a website. This is exactly what the AP spec says to do. Now, since the spec was published, most AP implementations also support HTTP signatures[0], but this doesn't provide additional guarantees that you can't get with WM. The authentication is still tied to a URL.As far as spamming goes, I don't see how WM is any worse than AP. In both protocols your only options are passlists and/or blocklists.[0]: And an old version that doesn't have an official spec. ActivityPub's issues with spec stagnation and de facto standards is a whole other thing.\n \nreply",
      "I haven't dug into these, so apologies for the naive question, but for a multi-tenant service like WordPress.com, can you effectively limit which WordPress blogs can WebMention you? If the allowlist is formed on the domain, this seems limiting.Perhaps more advanced URL regex can achieve more fine-grained control but I do still see advantages in pubkey auth (especially if people want to move their content.)Still, I do find myself wishing for a lighterweight-than-ActivityPub middleground.\n \nreply",
      "Webmention receivers can filter on whatever parts of a URL they want to. Maybe a WordPress implementation limits this to the domain? But as far as the spec goes, the receiver just gets a `source` parameter that's a URL. They can then decide to allow that (based on the domain, or any other characteristic they want) and at that point they check that URL to see if the document there contains the link that it's supposed to.\n \nreply",
      "You're right, in default configurations ActivityPub definitely has an advantage here, since HTTPsigs are tied to users, not instances, which gives finer grained blocking. I'm not aware of anything like this for Webmention.I suspect this is because WM is used far less than AP. It also grew out of a community (IndieWeb) where having your own domain is a core tenet.I think something like Mastodon could work with WM though, since all URLs hang off of user URLs, so you could block by URL prefix, ie \"block https://example.com/user1/*\".\n \nreply",
      "The OP here specifically wasn't including any auth features, which I was pretty sure would mean backtracks and comments aren't supported but maybe that's wring. It is possible with ActivityPub, but I'd personally be hesitant to run my own OAuth server just for a microblog.Regardless, my underlying point really is about what I expect of a microblog. If I'm hosting it myself I just want it to be my little corner of the internet, not a full fledged social media site that I have to maintain.

She wasn't the woman who washed Jesus' feet with her hair. Etc.AND YET... She was SO important to God, that she was chosen to be among the first to whom the resurrection was revealed, well before the 11 then-living Apostles.If you need another example about the misogyny of the early Church, note that she alone of almost ALL people who are mentioned as following Christ was never sainted.\n \nreply",
      "\"Mary Magdalene is considered to be a saint by the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran denominations.\" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene) Plenty of other references too!\n \nreply",
      "There are at least five different Mary's in the Gospels. She was not the prostitute, but the prostitute was also a Mary.It is, as you say, a misogynist way to dismiss the many women who were important during Jesus' ministry and during the founding of the early gentile Churches. But the book sure doesn't make it easy to keep em straight.\n \nreply",
      "There is no prostitute called Mary in the Gospels. There was a conflation of three women:- Mary Magdalene who had 7 devils cast out of her- Mary of Bethany who anointed Christ with oil close to his crucifixion- Unnamed woman who anointed Christ with oil and tears in the home of SimonNot only are these three woman separate and distinct, none of them are even explicitly called out as prostitutes. So they both conflated their stories and assumed what the sin was.Other Marys in the Gospels:- Mary the mother of Christ- Mary the mother of James- Mary of Clopas\n \nreply",

      "Aside from the well known public figures of the time, there no evidence any of the people in the bible existed, let alone did any of the things the book says. It's insane to have any arguments over the details of fictional stories outside a book club meet-up.\n \nreply",
      "Prior to 1850, there's no evidence my alleged ancestors even existed.\n \nreply",
      "In addition to her individual feast day the myrrhbearing women are commemorated on the second sunday after pascha in the eastern churches. Can't be more prominently celebrated short of a great feast.\n \nreply",
      "I watched a bit of the coverage of Pope Francis' coffin being brought into St. Peter's basilica, and heard \"Santa Maria Magdalena [pray for us]\" chanted by the choir.Also, the final episode of Martin Scorsese's \"The Saints\" series dropped, featuring her.\n \nreply"

Skeletal, stupefied, and wildly bedheaded, she contemplated distances across time and space, as saints and mystics do. As with many of the unsettling religious tchotchkes scattered around the rectory where I spent my childhood, I didn\u2019t give much thought to the unkempt icon, until more recently, when I grew curious about Mary Magdalene and began to read into the controversies swirling around her.Magdalene is the most famous woman in Christianity after Jesus\u2019 mother; she is also arguably the most hotly contested figure in the New Testament. A companion to Jesus in all four Gospels, she is present at his tomb, and, in some versions, is the first to see him after his Resurrection. In the Book of John, Jesus commissions her to share the good news of his return with the other disciples, which is why Thomas Aquinas, the thirteenth-century theologian, names her \u201cthe apostle to the apostles.\u201d Nonetheless, Magdalene ha",
    "summary": "**Hagiographic Hilarity: Mistaking Mary Magdalene**\n\nThe New Yorker discovers that an *ancient* and conveniently unidentified nude painting in a decrepit rectory is enough to spark a theological detective thriller, starring none other than Mary Magdalene, Christianity's \"it girl\" after the Virgin Mary. Commenters seize the stage to play \"actually, according to...\" with the mix-and-match identities of biblical Marys, each determined to prove their scripture-fu is stronger. Cue the profound revelation that these discussions hinge on figures whose historicity is as murky as a Dan Brown subplot. As the theological wrangling unfolds, expect pop culture references and the occasional \"has anyone really existed anyway?\" existential drop-in for that special touch of internet discourse seasoning. \ud83c\udf7f\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\udd0d"

      "This is a bit tangent, but does anyone know how to block an app from ever deciding to become a file handler on macOS?Every time I install Chrome on my machine (for testing purposes), macOS decides that Chrome is going to be the default file handler for a bunch of file associations, including HTML, WebP, and so on\u2026 and I have to figure out which was which for all of the mappings (which is super frustrating).\n \nreply",
      "Is there a way to pass arguments or some other options? For example, TextEdit can be opened in plain text or rich text mode.\n \nreply",
      "There is not, infat is subject to the limitations of Apple's API for setting handlers, which do not support passing in any data that an application could work with. If you wanted to, and have the time, I would recommend setting up a wrapper with https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus with applescript. Then you could make an alternate for whichever mode you please and set it as an opener using infat. Clunky but functional.\n \nreply",
