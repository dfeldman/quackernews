For 8 whole months, users have tried to <em>ctrl+c</em> their descent into madness, only to find that despair, unlike their desired text, cannot be copied to the clipboard. Meanwhile, Bugzilla warriors charge into the comment section, keyboards blazing, to argue whether this is a feature or a bug, or perhaps an anti-feature for those preferring to \"experience raw data\". One commenter, refusing to let logic challenge their lunacy, suggests that users should just memorize the whole internet - you know, to avoid using copy altogether. \ud83d\ude02"
