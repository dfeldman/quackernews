    "first_paragraph": "Bill Atkinson worked mostly at home, but whenever he made significant progress he rushed in to Apple to show it off to anyone who would appreciate it.   This time, he visited the Macintosh offices at Texaco Towers to show off his brand new oval routines, which were implemented using a really clever algorithm.",
    "summary": "Folklore.org treats us to a harrowing tale of Bill Atkinson, a man apparently so thrilled by the simple capability to make ovals that he 'rushed' to show them off like a child with a particularly engrossing booger. Apple, a company that has built its empire on the hard, round shoulders of such awe-inspiring geometric innovations, reveres Atkinson's \"really clever algorithm\" as though it were the secret to cold fusion. The comments, predictably, oscillate between worshipful praise for Atkinson as a demigod of rounded corners and scathing takedowns from the self-appointed elite of the programming world who insist they employed superior oval-drawing techniques in their mother's basement circa 1979. <em>Truly, we dwell in the golden age of circularity.</em>"
