      "I've reinvented my own wheel in a particular niche. I didn't set out to do that, but I rejected the existing state of the art as fundamentally misguided. Then, I attempted to divide-and-conquer my particular problem, something that is conventionally considered impossible.Against all odds, I not only succeeded (mostly thanks to ignorance and stubbornness), but my wheel turns out to be unbelievably good at what it does. Possibly even world-class. After further experimentation, it also enables feats that can only be described as pure heresy with troubling ease. Time passes and some people from that niche start picking up my wheel. They all hold it wrong at the beginning because it's so alien, but once they get the hang of it they never go back.I get bug reports and feature requests from all over the world for the oddest of use-cases and workflows. I have deep, in-depth technical discussions with brilliant people I would've never met otherwise. I've witnessed achievements done by others with my wheel beyond my wildest dreams. I discover things that keep me awake at night. I get kicks out of melting down the brains of my uninitiated coworkers and colleagues explaining what my wheel does and what I can do with it.Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel. You never know what crazy, wild path it might roll you down to.\n \nreply",
      "I'll bite! What wheel is this?\n \nreply",
      "This wheel: https://github.com/boricj/ghidra-delinker-extensionIt's a Ghidra extension that can export relocatable object files from any program selection. In other words, it reverses the work done by a linker.I originally built this as part of a video game decompilation project, having rejected the matching decompilation process used by the community at large. I still needed a way to divide and conquer the problem, which is how I got the funny idea of dividing programs. That allows a particular style of decompilation project I call Ship of Theseus: reimplementing chunks of a program one piece at a time and letting the linker stitch everything back together at every step, until you've replaced all the original binary code with reimplemented source code.It's an exquisitely deep and complex topic, chock-full of ABI tidbits and toolchains shenanigans. There's next to no literature on this and it's antithetical to anything one might learn in CS 101. The technique itself is as powerful as it is esoteric, but I like to think that any reverse-engineer can leverage it with my tooling.In particular, resynthesizing relocations algorithmically is one of those problems subject to the Pareto principle, where getting 80% of them right is reasonably easy but whittling down the last 20% is punishingly hard. Since I refuse to manually annotate them, I've had to relentlessly improve my analyzers until they get every last corner case right. It's by far the most challenging and exacting software engineering problem I've ever tackled, one that suffers no hacks or shortcuts.Once I got it working, I then proceeded in the name of science to commit countless crimes against computer science with it (some of those achievements are documented on my blog). Cross-delinking in particular, that is delinking an artifact to a different platform that it originates from, is particularly mind-bending ; I've had some successes with it, but I sadly currently lack the tooling to bring this to its logical conclusion: Mad Max, but with program bits instead of car parts.Ironically, most of my users are using it for matching decompilation projects: they delink object files from an artifact, then typically launch objdiff and try to create a source file that, when compiled, generates an object file that is equivalent to the one they ripped out of the artifact. I did not expect that to happen at all since I've built this tool to specifically not do this, but I guess when everything's a nail, people will manage to wield anything as a hammer.\n \nreply",
      "This is highly reminiscent of work I was exposed to in grad school on recombining library versions from different binary distributions in an attempt to diversify the attack surface of a system, but at a much more granular level:https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~soma/pubs/bfoster-gecco-2010...",

      "When you write and compile code, there is a phase called \"linking\".  For example, one could compile pieces of code and then link them together into one binary.A common challenge is decompiling and reverse engineering a compiled program, e.g. a game. The author realized that it's an interesting approach to do a sort of reverse-linking (or I guess unlinking) process of a program into pieces and then focusing on reverse engineering or reimplementing those pieces instead of the whole.When it comes to decompiling games, enthusiasts in that hobby want to be able to reproduce/obtain source code that compiles to exactly the same instructions as the original game. I think there is usually also a differentiation between instruction matching and byte for byte matching reproduction. But it definitely seems like a simpler and better approach to do this piece by piece and be able to test with each new piece of progress.That's my layman understanding of it having only dabbled in decompiling stuff.\n \nreply",
      "This is pretty much spot on.The key insight of delinking is that object files are relocatable and the process of linking them together (laying their sections in memory, computing all the symbol addresses, applying all the relocations) removes that property. But by reversing this process (creating a symbol table, unapplying the relocations/resynthesizing relocation tables, slicing new sections), code and data can be made relocatable again.Since properly delinked object files are relocatable, the linker can process them and stitch everything back together seamlessly, even if the pieces are moved around or no longer fit where they used to be (this makes for a particularly powerful form of binary patching, as constraints coming from the original program's memory map no longer apply). Alternatively, they can be fed to anything that can process object files, like a disassembler for example.Of course, the real fun begins when you start reusing delinked object files to make new programs. I like to say that it breaks down the linear flow of toolchain from compilation to assembly to linking into a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, bitsy wimey stuff. Especially if you start cross-delinking to a different platform than the original pieces of the program came from.\n \nreply",
      "I think this finally answers a question I've had since I started learning programming. All my life I've been told \"you can't convert a shared library to a static library\". When you try to probe for more details, all you get is some mumbling about how a shared library is already prelinked for mapping into memory so the relocation table is lost. When you press further about the precise information loss that prevents you from reconstructing it, you get the equivalent of \"you just can't ok!\".That was never satisfying to me because recompilation (decompiling to source code or IR that can be recompiled for another platform) is an academic field of study [1], so the problem of converting a shared library to a static one should be easier. After all, you have all the assembly and symbol information right there, it seemed like all you needed to do was massage it the right way.[1] https://rev.ng/\n \nreply",
      "This comment has made my day in ways words cannot express.But yeah, one recurring problem is that without literature on this esoteric and complex topic, any discussion remotely technical about it (especially without prior context) quickly bogs down, as it needs to be bootstrapped from first principles in order to make any sense.I've been meaning to write the Necronomicon of delinking to at least be able to point people to a document that contains everything they need to know in order to understand or at least decently grasp this. At the very least it should make for a good horror bed time story for linker developers.\n \nreply"

      ">  The way he managed to beat a trillion dollar corporation was through the kind of simple but tedious and boring work that Apple sucks at: regression testing.> Because, you see: this has happened before. On iOS 12, SockPuppet was one of the big exploits used by jailbreaks. It was found and reported to Apple by Ned Williamson from Project Zero, patched by Apple in iOS 12.3, and subsequently unrestricted on the Project Zero bug tracker. But against all odds, it then resurfaced on iOS 12.4, as if it had never been patched. I can only speculate that this was because Apple likely forked XNU to a separate branch for that version and had failed to apply the patch there, but this made it evident that they had no regression tests for this kind of stuff. A gap that was both easy and potentially very rewarding to fill. And indeed, after implementing regression tests for just a few known 1days, Pwn got a hit.And now I wonder how many other projects are doing this. Is anyone running a CI farm running historical vulnerabilities on new versions of Linux/FreeBSD/OpenWRT/OpenSSH/...? It would require that someone wrote up each vulnerability in automated form (a low bar, I think), have the CI resources to throw at it (higher bar, though you could save by running a random selection on each new version), care (hopefully easy), and think of it (surprisingly hard).\n \nreply",

Instead, due to culture war side taking, they hobble themselves to be ever dependent on the petro-extraction and refinement industries.\n \nreply",
      "In every movie except the first one (where society was starting to collapse, it hadn't fallen yet) the question of \"where's the gas\" is a major plot deviceI'm not going to sit here and argue Beyond Thunderdome is high art or anything, but kind of the whole point of the Mad Max films is not just to comment on resource scarcity and control but to make them the call to action for everything in the story.

      "Sure making high quality gasoline is difficult, but making shitty gasoline or fuels that can take the place of gasoline with a bit less power is not some crazy technology. Gasoline engines, if tuned to do so, will run off naptha and ethanol mixtures. And if you are creating it fresh, like from the existence of a place called gas town, it will allow you to use more volatile but higher octane fuels mixed to make decent octane gasoline, it just won't last sitting around for very long. And methanol is fairly easy to produce from heating up nearly any organic matter up in a dry still. Diesel engines will run off nearly any oil that will burn.I mean sure, fuel refining knowledge isn't super common, but plenty of people still know enough about it and chemistry to less efficiently produce fuels as long as they have a source material, be it an actual oil well or enough organic materials, with some basic tooling. Tooling which we would already know exists by the fact that people are maintaining a fleet of vehicles. And you also have to remember that Max himself was alive and working in world pre-collapse, it isn't a world 10+ generations into an apocalypse, only like 2 maybe bordering on 3 generations of apocalypse with some people still remembering the old world, albeit in a decaying state.There are hippies that process wood into usable liquid fuels you can find on youtube. If we wanted to be more realistic, they would be driving less, and have a far higher percentage of diesel vehicles because diesel is so much easier to make and the engines are easier to run on even garbage fuels.

      "I believe that it is not that style helps the content to be more right, not in the way PG believes (like in the example about writing shorter sentences), it is that a richer style (so, not shorter, but neither baroque: a style with more possibilities) can reflect a less obvious way of thinking, that carries more signal.I'll make an example that makes this concept crystal crisp, and that you will likely remember for the rest of your life (no kidding). In Italy there was a great writer called Giuseppe Pontiggia. He had to write an article for one of the main newspapers in Italy about the Nobel Prize in Literature, that with the surprise of many, was never assigned, year after year, to Borges. He wrote (sorry, translating from memory, I'm not an English speaker and I'm not going to use an LLM for this comment):\"Two are the prizes that each year the Swedish academy assigns: one is assigned to the winner of the prize, the other is not assigned to Borges\".This uncovers much more than just: even this year the prize was not assigned to Borges. And, honestly, I never saw this kind of style heights in PG writings (I appreciate the content most of the times, but having translated a few of his writings in Italian, I find the style of PG fragile: brings the point at home but never escapes simple constructs). You don't reach that kind of Pontiggia style with the process in the article here, but via a very different process that only the best writers are able to perform and access.\n \nreply",

      "Back in the late 70's, I made a rotary phone dialer for my HP41C calculator.  I connected a NC reed relay to the piezoelectric beeper and put the NC contacts in-line with my telephone line.  I used \"synthetic programming\" (undocumented opcodes) to get the short duration beeps needed for the dialing pulses.  I could enter a name (alphanumeric!) and it would look up and dial the phone number.About 10 years ago, I met a guy named Keith Jarrett at my company.  As I was about to ask him if he was the Keith Jarrett who wrote a HP-41C Synthetic Programming Manual, he interrupted me and said, \"No, I'm not the musician.  Everybody asks me that.\"  So I finished my question and he was very happy and surprised, because he was the author of the book I had read 35 years prior.https://picclick.com/HP-41-Synthetic-Programming-Made-Easy-b...https://www.hpmuseum.org/prog/synth41.htm\n \nreply",

(My patent was eventually allowed to lapse. Steve's has been renewed).I have to say that I had had a bit too much to drink at a dinner in SF when I suggested this idea to my colleague. I was thinking of the old pinball game that had really good physics making it feel amazingly real. I thought that the crucial part was doing the dialing physics in such a way that users could quickly dial any digit with the right gesture.I was not disclosed on the iPhone when I came up with this idea, but my colleague sent the idea off to the patent committee and they agreed to it! They must have laughed when they saw the similarities to Steve's patent (which was still in progress too). We did have some big differences with Steve's, so it wasn't a duplicate.

      "Photosensitivity in WLCSP parts is not something that was \u201cdiscovered\u201d by the community.The data sheets for WLCSP parts specify that the part is photosensitive and often give data on how light can affect the part.This has been known since the inception of WLCSP, and is treated as a design parameter by responsible engineers.Chip manufacturers know that bare silicon chips are light sensitive, they are literally made of thousands/millions/billions of tiny solar panel junctions. CMOS imaging tech evolved from exposing cmos memory chips to a focused image. WLCSP chips are basically unpackaged silicon chips.None of this is a \u201cdiscovery\u201d.

It\u2019s a basic engineering responsibility, and failing to do so is an abdication of your duties and responsibilities as an engineer.Anyway, cool story except I get the definite feel that the article was written or heavily influenced by LLM output, by the pedantic cadence and constant summarization.\n \nreply",

Light-protective covers are a very standard feature in construction of any kind of critical device that uses WLCSP parts.In the case of the raspberry pi, the fact that it is a hobby device is a pretty good excuse for leaving the devices unprotected, but I definitely would have included the fact that the design incorporates WLCSP parts in critical roles and that the PCB should be in a case if being used in mission critical applications, since presumably, designers integrating RPI are less likely to be experienced board-level engineers.My comment about being a hack or a noob really wasn\u2019t meant for the RPI designers, though I can see how it would be easy to read it that way.

WLCSP photosensitivity is an uncommon phenomenon that requires a very strong and specific light source\"In 1967, Dawon Kahng and Simon Min Sze at Bell Labs proposed that the floating gate of a MOSFET could be used for the cell of a reprogrammable ROM (read-only memory).[3] Building on this concept, Dov Frohman of Intel invented EPROM in 1971,[3] and was awarded U.S. patent 3,660,819 in 1972. Frohman designed the Intel 1702, a 2048-bit EPROM, which was announced by Intel in 1971.[3]\"\"The programming process is not electrically reversible. To erase the data stored in the array of transistors, ultraviolet light is directed onto the die. Photons of the UV light cause ionization within the silicon oxide, which allows the stored charge on the floating gate to dissipate. Since the whole memory array is exposed, all the memory is erased at the same time.

Other companies have to start on the back of their heels so their products can't suck.Their hardware designers are inept with every generation of every product they've made having issues and/or promised features not making it into production.Their QA is non-existent despite seeding test boards widely where either they're not catching problems before doing into production or they're intentionally not fixing stuff because it would increase their costs and they know people will just snap up whatever garbage the Pi Foundation ships. The problems are so bad that you have to ask how they even got past internal testing and validation.Seriously: if a bunch of college EE students worked for a semester they could probably build a better product.Each generation of the Raspberry Pi has had basic hardware design flaws showing that their hardware engineering was not up to the task of producing the dominant hobbyist (and increasingly commercial/industrial, somewhat frighteningly) SBC.Then they fucked up the RP2040, a wildly simpler product. When when they released a revised version that fixed the ADC issue, they fucked up GPIO.

When I was scaffolding in Australia, I was 70Kg and 178cm tall. I was working with people who were 100-120kg+, Those people would have been carrying 4-5 steel boards about 80-100kgs on their shoulder, I was carrying 3-4 steel boards 60-80kgs.\nLight duty scaffold, is 2 boards wide (450mm) and 3m long bays. I could pass another person my weight, but some one who is 100-120Kg+ I would struggle on scaffold.\nMost of it is build at heavy duty steel which is 5 boards wide + 2 board hop ups and 2.4m long (Standards say it should be 1.8m long).\nAfter 45M high, scaffold has to restart again and they use I beams inside the buildings and U heads under the screw jacks before they start building again.\nI prefer buildings 4 storeys high (1 ground + 3 levels), that is you get the sun in the winter and if the shit hits the fan even if you jump from that high you may break bones but you should still be able to live depending on what you land on.\n \nreply",

When I click on them there are two buttons with download/upload icons, but neither one is doing anything when I click it.The \"Featured Pet Transformations\" below that are good illustrations of the concept, except the \"Happy Shiba\" example starts from a not-shiba (long floppy ears) and through the magic of GPT-Image-1 becomes an entirely different dog (pointy triangular ears). That makes it look more like an image generator than a restyling of your actual pet.I wonder if there's anything you can do with the image transformation to make it keep distinctive features of the source material? \"Tuxedo Cat\" for another example, it makes up a different white and black cat from the one that was provided. The white patch in the original goes up around one eye while the sticker has a pointy triangle up the middle, and its legs were both white but in the sticker they're black with white paws.EDIT - giving it another look, the \"Banana Buddy\" example for Cute Style is also turning a bulldog into a terrier\n \nreply",
      "Thank you for the feedback. Those 'transformation examples' are definitely one thing that I was sloppy with. All of the nice outputs are actually derived from pet photos that are legitimately \"visibly similar\" to the outputs, but I really wanted to push this out so I didn't do my proper diligence.Here is a video walkthrough to show you some of the meat around image generation / sticker packing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcn8dSt7CcQI have been working on more advanced features like 1) splitting images into separate images, and 2) re-packing into a single image sheet after validation that the 'biometric color palate' and the 'specific physical attributes that make this thing the thing it is' passes are both sufficiently high in terms of confidence level.I wanted to initially just have a plain vanilla canvas that you plop images into and then have a \"Loom\" like experience for regenerating images / creating pseudo-pipelines with just touch/mouse commands and more, but I found that users said it was too opaque and required too much 'obscure prompt engineering experience' to click around to make outputs \"pretty\" (direct quote).thank you for taking a look @wlesieutre, I really appreciate it\n \nreply"

      "It's a nice write up but I'm not sure what the contribution is. I would have expected more engagement with Peter Van Roy's work, in particular his and Seif Haridi's epic book CTM [1] where the logic variable got properly unpacked more than 15 years previously. Or at least a citation.Has anyone looked into how to decouple logic variables from backtracking? i.e., is there a good reason to unbind a variable apart from the Prolog discipline? (Without unbinding we get single-assignment variables where initialisation is decoupled from declaration, which I feel can often be simulated with laziness ala Haskell, but see CTM.)[1] https://webperso.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html\n \nreply",
      "Maybe I'm not understanding the insight here, but it sort of seams like having confluence defeats the purpose of logical semantics.My specific concern is that by having logical semantics in a language you can represent non-deterministic ambiguous computations, but for this you need divergent paths which, if I understand correctly, the authors have removed from their language. So what's the point of doing this?\n \nreply"

A fervent commenter, probably typing from their mom\u2019s basement, bemoans the audacity of not citing Peter Van Roy's game-changing work from a prehistoric era when flip phones were in vogue. Meanwhile, another scholar scratches their head, puzzled as to why determinism snuck up in a playground obviously meant for the free spirits of non-deterministic computations.

      "Nowadays, most people who say astrophotography don't mean Deep Sky photography, hunting planets, nebula and galaxies. It's mostly the sky over a wide-angle landscape. \"Astrophotography\" happens at < 20mm.Totally viable untracked. The classic 14mm prime has gone from f2.8 to f1.8 to f1.4, and sensors have become really good at high sensitivity for a 15 second exposure. Quite often, that's enough.The hairy part is when it's not quite enough, and exposures have to be stacked. I have a crop sensor camera (canon 1.6x, so 40% area) with an f/2 lens that I like to step down further, and a good Starscape this way will take 10-40 exposures. I can stack those no problem, but it's trees on the horizon that are problematic. The ground stack and the sky stack have to clash, and a complex shaped border will always look photoshopped, because it is.Old school Deep Sky is losing its appeal due to a) pictures being available online, meaning that you've already seen the better version of the same photo, and b) the images being sterile and without context, with no relation to the photographer's story. Milky Way in a national park says \"I've been there!\" in a way that a shot of the Whirlpool Galaxy just can't.\n \nreply",
      "Yes, and it is already happening in professional astronomy. For example, the \"Antarctic Tianmu Plan\" [0] have shown that you can successfully capture non-trailed images without using tracking mounts by using drift-scanning CCDs\u2014basically letting the sky move across your sensor while the detector is read out at the same rate.[0] - https://doi.org/10.1117/12.3019468\n \nreply",
      "You can, but dark noise is a problem with this technique as your SNR per bucket ends up being low. The purpose of long exposures with tracking is to maximise your SNR.Also, it helps significantly to be in Antarctica, where the relative movement is much slower than it is at lower latitudes \u2014 and to have multiple telescopes - and low noise CCDs, in a cold, dry environment.Sadly, most of us don\u2019t have those luxuries.\n \nreply",
      "what about computational methods? i have always wondered how stacking many short exposures without tracking compares to deconvolution of a single long exposure. it seems that there is software able to do this by taking into account both motion blur and the PSF of the imaging system:https://siril.readthedocs.io/en/stable/processing/deconvolut...\n \nreply",
      "The problem is that the noise can swamp the signal.  Another example of this would be doing astrophotography during the day.  The sun doesn't block anything, it just makes the sky glow with \"noise\".  Theoretically it has exactly as much signal from space as it does at night, but because the sun adds so much noise it's completely lost.\n \nreply",
      "Isn't trackerless astrophotography one of the main use cases for software that can do stacking like Siril [0] and similar tools [1] out there?0. https://siril.org/1. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAstrophotography/comments/1b7fz3...\n \nreply",
      "Siril is for integrating a lot of images together that are tracked and then removing the background.  While you may be able to use it untracked it is primarily for tracked images.\n \nreply",
      "Yes those software do align the images based on the stars so it can compensate for movement.\n \nreply",
      "Tracking is needed for when you want to do say 15 second exposures.The new technique for astrophotography isnt long exposures. Its about fast exposures in an attempt to maximize good atmospheric wobble.\n \nreply",
      "That's called lucky imaging, yes. It's not particcularly new btw. Also, for capturing very faint deep sky objects like galaxies and nebulae you need long exposures of several minutes to get the deeper detail.\n \nreply"

    "first_paragraph": "Posted byKarl Perera MA\u2013Astrophotography without tracking is absolutely possible and can produce stunning results with the right techniques. By choosing bright and stationary targets like the Milky Way, using a sturdy tripod, and applying methods like the 500 Rule, you can capture breathtaking night sky photos without the need for expensive tracking equipment. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to master astrophotography without tracking, even as a beginner.You can do astrophotography without a star tracker by attaching a DSLR camera to a sturdy tripod1. This will limit the length of your exposures to 15-20 seconds. With a lens of 17\u201324mm, stacking hundreds of photos will create a good image of the Milky Way. Deep Sky targets need bigger lenses and shorter subs.If you want to take amazing photos of the night sky without tracking, you need an astrophotography DSLR camera with a wide-angle lens.
