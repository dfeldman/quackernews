      "As a deeper issue on \"justification\", here is something I wrote related to this in 2001 on the risks of non-profits engaging in self-dealing when they create artificial scarcity to enrich themselves:https://pdfernhout.net/on-funding-digital-public-works.html#...\"Consider this way of looking at the situation. A 501(c)3 non-profit creates a digital work which is potentially of great value to the public and of great value to others who would build on that product. They could put it on the internet at basically zero cost and let everyone have it effectively for free. Or instead, they could restrict access to that work to create an artificial scarcity by requiring people to pay for licenses before accessing the content or making derived works. If they do the latter and require money for access, the non-profit can perhaps create revenue to pay the employees of the non-profit. But since the staff probably participate in the decision making about such licensing (granted, under a board who may be all volunteer), isn't that latter choice still in a way really a form of \"self-dealing\" -- taking public property (the content) and using it for private gain? From that point of view, perhaps restricting access is not even legal?\"\"Self-dealing might be clearer if the non-profit just got a grant, made the product, and then directly sold the work for a million dollars to Microsoft and put the money directly in the staff's pockets (who are also sometimes board members). Certainly if it was a piece of land being sold such a transaction might put people in jail. But because the content or software sales are small and generally to their mission's audience they are somehow deemed OK. The trademark-infringing non-profit-sheltered project I mention above is as I see it in large part just a way to convert some government supported PhD thesis work and ongoing R&D grants into ready cash for the developers. Such \"spin-offs\" are actually encouraged by most funders. And frankly if that group eventually sells their software to a movie company, say, for a million dollars, who will really bat an eyebrow or complain? (They already probably get most of their revenue from similar sales anyway -- but just one copy at a time.) But how is this really different from the self-dealing of just selling charitably-funded software directly to Microsoft and distributing a lump sum? Just because \"art\" is somehow involved, does this make everything all right? To be clear, I am not concerned that the developers get paid well for their work and based on technical accomplishments they probably deserve that (even if we do compete for funds in a way). What I am concerned about is the way that the proprietary process happens such that the public (including me) never gets full access to the results of the publicly-funded work (other than a few publications without substantial source).\"That said, charging to provide a service that costs money to supply (e.g. GPU compute) is not necessarily self-dealing. It is restricting the source code or using patents to create artificial scarcity around those services that could be seen that way.\n \nreply",

      "I've run my homelab with podman-systemd (quadlet) for awhile and every time I investigate a new k8s variant it just isn't worth the extra hassle. As part of my ancient Ansible playbook I just pre-pull images and drop unit files in the right place.I even run my entire Voron 3D printer stack with podman-systemd so I can update and rollback all the components at once, although I'm looking at switching to mkosi and systemd-sysupdate and just update/rollback the entire disk image at once.The main issues are:\n1. A lot of people just distribute docker-compose files, so you have to convert it to systemd units.\n2. A lot of docker images have a variety of complexities around user/privilege setup that you don't need with podman. Sometimes you need to do annoying userns idmapping, especially if a container refuses to run as root and/or switches to another user.Overall, though, it's way less complicated than any k8s (or k8s variant) setup. It's also nice to have everything integrated into systemd and journald instead of being split in two places.\n \nreply",
      "I share the author's sentiment completely. At my day job, I manage multiple Kubernetes clusters running dozens of microservices with relative ease. However, for my hobby projects\u2014which generate no revenue and thus have minimal budgets\u2014I find myself in a frustrating position: desperately wanting to use Kubernetes but unable to due to its resource requirements. Kubernetes is simply too resource-intensive to run on a $10/month VPS with just 1 shared vCPU and 2GB of RAM.This limitation creates numerous headaches. Instead of Deployments, I'm stuck with manual docker compose up/down commands over SSH. Rather than using Ingress, I have to rely on Traefik's container discovery functionality. Recently, I even wrote a small script to manage crontab idempotently because I can't use CronJobs. I'm constantly reinventing solutions to problems that Kubernetes already solves\u2014just less efficiently.What I really wish for is a lightweight alternative offering a Kubernetes-compatible API that runs well on inexpensive VPS instances.

      "I'm laughing because I clicked your link thinking I agreed and had posted similar things and it's my comment.Still on k3s, still love it.My cluster is currently hosting 94 pods across 55 deployments.  Using 500m cpu (half a core) average, spiking to 3cores under moderate load, and 25gb ram.  Biggest ram hog is Jellyfin (which appears to have a slow leak, and gets restarted when it hits 16gb, although it's currently streaming to 5 family members).The cluster is exclusively recycled old hardware (4 machines), mostly old gaming machines.  The most recent is 5 years old, the oldest is nearing 15 years old.The nodes are bare Arch linux installs - which are wonderfully slim, easy to configure, and light on resources.It burns 450Watts on average, which is higher than I'd like, but mostly because I have jellyfin and whisper/willow (self hosted home automation via voice control) as GPU accelerated loads - so I'm running an old nvidia 1060 and 2080.Everything is plain old yaml, I explicitly avoid absolutely anything more complicated (including things like helm and kustomize - with very few exceptions) and it's... wonderful.It's by far the least amount of \"dev-ops\" I've had to do for self hosting.  Things work, it's simple, spinning up new service is a new folder and 3 new yaml files (0-namespace.yaml, 1-deployment.yaml, 2-ingress.yaml) which are just copied and edited each time.Any three machines can go down and the cluster stays up (metalLB is really, really cool - ARP/NDP announcements mean any machine can announce as the primary load balancer and take the configured IP).  Sometimes services take a minute to reallocate (and jellyfin gets priority over willow if I lose a gpu, and can also deploy with cpu-only transcoding as a fallback), and I haven't tried to be clever getting 100% uptime because I mostly don't care.  If I'm down for 3 minutes, it's not the end of the world.  I have a couple of commercial services in there, but it's free hosting for family businesses, they can also afford to be down an hour or two a year.Overall - I'm not going back.  It's great.  Strongly, STRONGLY recommend k3s over microk8s.  Definitely don't want to go back to single machine wrangling.  The learning curve is steeper for this... but man do I spend very little time thinking about it at this point.I've streamed video from it as far away as literally the other side of the world (GA, USA -> Taiwan).  Amazon/Google/Microsoft have everyone convinced you can't host things yourself.  Even for tiny projects people default to VPS's on a cloud.  It's a ripoff.  Put an old laptop in your basement - faster machine for free.  At GCP prices... I have 30k/year worth of cloud compute in my basement, because GCP is a god damned rip off.  My costs are $32/month in power, and a network connection I already have to have, and it's replaced hundreds of dollars/month in subscription costs.For personal use-cases... basement cloud is where it's at.\n \nreply",

The etcd, or it's replacement, is constantly(?) firing off watch notifications or reconciliation notifications based on the inputs from the aforementioned kubelet updates. Only the actual kube-apiserver is conceptually idle as I'm not aware of any compute that it, itself, does only in response to requests made of itPut another way, in my experience running clusters, in $(ps auwx) or its $(top) friend always show etcd or sqlite generating all of the \"WHAT are you doing?!\" and those also represent the actual risk to running kubernetes since the apiserver is mostly stateless[1]1: but holy cow watch out for mTLS because cert expiry will ruin your day across all of the components\n \nreply",

At the time, I actually went out and bought a NUC to act as a little hypervisor so that I could play around with a small cluster at home.Funnily enough, my blog post on this was six years ago to the very day.The main lesson that I learned is that although Kubernetes is made up of all sorts of pieces and web services and sidecars and webhooks, basically acts as a giant while loop as follows:If I said there should be a Pod here, and there wasn't, Kubernetes would create it. If I said there should be 3 replicas and there were 4, Kubernetes would get rid of one.This actually extended out in really cool ways, such as with cert-manager.

      "I think comparing it to Vector Database is confusing as database would typically mean indexes and some sort of query support.Storing Embeddings with File is interesting concept... we already do it for some file formats (ie EXIF), where this one is generalized... yet you would need to have some actual database to load this data into to process at scale.Another issue I see is support for different models and embedding formats to make this data really portable - like I can take my file drop it into any system and its embedding \"seamlessly\" integrates\n \nreply",
      "If I understand correctly, this is attaching metadata to files in a format that LLMs (or any tool that can understand the semantic embedding vector) can leverage to understand what a file is without having to actually read the contents of the file.That obviously has a lot of interesting use cases, but my first assumption was that this could be used to quickly/easily search your filesystem with some prompt like \"Play the video from last month where we went camping and saw a flock of turkeys\". But that would require having an actual vector DB running on your system which you could use to quickly look up files using an embedding of your query, no?\n \nreply",
      "Hi, it is quite different, there is no LLM involved, we can certainly use it for a RAG for example, but what is currently implemented is basically a way to generate embeddings (vector representation) which are then used for search later, it is all offline and local (no data is ever sent to cloud from your files).\n \nreply",

I was just wondering what the value add of this is if there's no other background process (like mds on macOS) which is using it to build a search index.I guess what I'm asking is: how does VectorVFS enable search besides iterating through all files and iteratively comparing file embeddings with the embedding of a search query? The project description says \"efficient and semantically searchable\" and \"eliminating the need for external index files or services\" but I can't think of any more efficient way to do a search without literally walking the entire filesystem tree to look for the file with the most similar vector.Edit: reading the docs [1] confirmed this.

      "magic(5) is a system for determining the type of a file by examining the 'magic bytes' at or near the start of a file.For example, POSIX tar files have a defined file format that starts with a header struct: https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.h...You can see that at byte offset 257 is `char magic[6]`, which contains `TMAGIC`, which is the byte string \"ustar\\0\". Thus, if a file has the bytes 'ustar\\0' at offset 257 we can reasonably assume that it's a tar file. Almost every defined file type has some kind of string of 'magic' predefined bytes at a predefined location that lets a program know \"yes, this is in fact a JPEG file\" rather than just asserting \"it says .jpg so let's try to interpret this bytestring and see what happens\".As for how it's similar: I don't think it actually is, I think that's a misunderstanding. The metadata that this vector FS is storing is more than \"this is a a JPEG\" or \"this is a word document\", as I understand it, so comparing it to magic(5) is extremely reductionist.

But agenty LLM configurations aren't just the LLM; they're also code that structures the LLM interactions.

      "It is unreal to me the amount of impact Daft Punk had with only four studio albums.\n \nreply",
      "(They also did the Soundtrack for Tron:Legacy, basically their fifth studio album)Anyway, I keep remembering how panned 'Human After All' was, and how bad the reviews were because the album was too \"mechanical\" and was \"missing the warmth of House\", while this is EXACTLY how the genre evolved in the years to come and none of those music experts saw this.Many journalists did a retrospective of it a few years later and admitted that they misjudged it.It's not that Daft Punk drove the industry in this direction, the album wasn't well-received by most at that time. They showed the destination of a journey while people didn't even realize they are traveling...In the end, it appears that 'Random Access Memories' is one of their least innovative and \"lasting\" albums. It's probably their most successful one, the most complex to conceptualize and produce, but IMO it has the least unique character of all their productions.Looking at the whole picture, the product of \"Random Access Memories\" is less the music, but the duo celebrating the process of production itself...\n \nreply",
      "The reason that I dislike Human After All is that, quite simply, it's not fun.It's dour. It's depressing. And it's repetitive in a way that feels tiresome; You can't dance to most of it or even really tap your foot to it.What happened was that Daft Punk challenged themselves to make an album in six weeks and ended up with a showcase for a few neat guitar pedals and two fun songs (Robot Rock and Technologic), one of which consists almost entirely of a barely-changed sample (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFwGQAEYqHs).Electronic music certainly evolved in ways that made it less warm, but that didn't make it less fun. Case in point, Skrillex's early music is weird and playful despite relying on 'cold' synth sounds. Human After All is just cold.\n \nreply",
      "Fine not to like it for those reasons.  But maybe try listen to it next time from a more psych, garage, or post-rock perspective.  They were influenced very early on by groups like Spacemen 3, and I see HAA as them doing something big and dirgey in this kind of school.  I even recall the liner notes saying only \"all guitars by Daft Punk\".\n \nreply",

      "\"in a way that feels tiresome\" is the operative phrase here. I like the throwaway tracks on Homework that are twice as long and half as interesting more than I like most of Human After All. They're fun.\n \nreply",
      "Not to be that guy, but techno is only repetitive if you are a) listening to boring/uninspired techno (the same kind of complaint being leveled here against HAA), or b) not paying attention.\n \nreply",

      "For some time, authentication was not part of the MCP. Now it\u2019s there https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/bas... so I\u2019m wondering what is being addressed in Klavis. Is it something that the reference implementation of MCP lacks? If so, will it eventually make it to MCP?I think it\u2019s important to release SDKs that are secure by default, so not providing this in the reference MCP would be a big issue.In my view, MCP should be maintained by the vendors themselves. It\u2019s too complicated to use in the enterprise if everything comes from the community with questionable security. So I applaud initiatives that try to solve this. I think smithery.ai provides something similar while also being a repository of servers (I\u2019m not associated with them), but again the problem is needing to trust an extra middleman vendor.Does anyone else share this view? For example, will AWS (or insert any other hyperscaler) end up providing the \u201cBedrock\u201d of MCP where security is native to the platform? Or will individual companies (Box, Google, MS, etc.) start rolling them out as part of their standard developer APIs?\n \nreply",
      "Yes thank you! the newest MCP spec added the authentication part but it seems that people think it is still not perfect and are doing more modifications to the auth part. E.g. https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol.... We will also keep an eye on the spec development.\n \nreply",
      "> For example, will AWS (or insert any other hyperscaler) end up providing the \u201cBedrock\u201d of MCP where security is native to the platform?Cloudflare already provides something along those lines with MCP on Workers with authentication (via their zero trust product AFAIK): https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-se...Sounds like they were one of the partners with Anthropic in their recent \u201cIntegrations\u201d announcement.\n \nreply",
      "I've seen a number of projects re-implement the same MCP servers that exist elsewhere, and I wonder if we're doomed to do this over and over and over again. One of the huge draws of MCP servers was a reusable standard to describe tools, but if everyone re-implements their own tools, then where's the value?I assume this comes from the fact that it is very easy to create an MCP server, it is much harder to create a good MCP server. And so, a number of companies have fallen into \"not invented here\" or they just want to be able to control the quality of the MCP servers (that's fair). a \"GitHub MCP\" is a dime-a-dozen but I wrote a lot of MCP servers just for myself because often the servers provided 80% of what I wanted. It's early days for MCP but it's been easier in all cases to just write my own MCP from scratch instead of trying to fork off something existing. I'm sure that will change as time goes on but MCP is, often, a thin layer over a SDK/API, it's not hard to implement.All of this gets to an idea that I've been playing around in my head and and have written about a fourth of a blog post on, which is \"MCP interfaces\". MCP Interfaces, put very simply, is the concept of a pluggable way to swap out different MCP servers that may not implement the exact same tools, but are the same spirit of tools. So, for example, a way to plug in Google search, Bing search, SearXNG, or Jina.ai search.Why do we even need \"interfaces\"? Well, throwing all the tools at every LLM is a recipe for disaster in multiple ways (privacy, security, sanity, the list goes on) and often agents work best with a limited set of tools they know how to best utilize. That's all well and good and I'm sure most SaaS' out there will write their own tools or pick off-the-shelf MCP servers but for the open source world I've been thinking it would be nice to slot in your own MCP tools for certain tasks.Search is an easy example. Lots of tools can make use of search (other good examples might be headless/headed browser automation, or memory/RAG) and I've seen the trend of different LLM application asking for all sorts of ways to do search. Some ask for your Google API key, some want Jina, some want SearXNG (some want to spin up their own docker container for SearXNG). It's all over the place, it's inconsistent, and it's a ton of wasted work. I don't want to ask the developer of \"insert cool LLM application\" to support my special-snowflake MCP server or tool, but I also don't want to just throw additional tools at the agents.So far the best I can come up with is \"MCP Interface\" where an application can have a \"minimum viable\" tool(s) definition and then you can slot in MCP tools that meet that standard. Maybe \"Interface\" is too strict even, maybe it would just work to say \"Here are my search tools, use them wherever you would provide an agent with search features\". \"MCP Tagging\"?I'm not sure and in a year maybe we won't even be talking about MCP or maybe the world of plug and play will be tiny/non-existent so this idea will not matter. In a way it seems too utopian to imagine we'd end up in a place where a user can say \"I have my own search, let's use that\" and instead we will have MCP app stores inside SaaS products (with no overlap or use outside the SaaS in question), or maybe we won't even get that, you'll just get whatever the SaaS wrote or, more likely, got from the open source community.\n \nreply",
      "Yes thank you for sharing your thoughts. The MCP interfaces definitely sound promising. However I think it does not stop people from building other MCP servers . And different people may have different opinions regarding how to design this interface for a search MCP server.TBH I think all of these problems are still very new (remember MCP is only 6 months old) and I think we need to wait and see how things evolve.\n \nreply",
