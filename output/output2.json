I do not think anyone has beaten it - nobody's managed to run Linux on a lower-end device than that 8-bit AVR. The main problem was that is was too slow to be practical. The effective speed was 10KHz, the boot time was 6 hours. Cool, but I doubt that any one of those people who built one of those devices based on my design ever waited for the device to boot more than once. It was time to improve it!\nSo what could I improve? A number of things. First, I wanted the new design to be speedy enough to boot in a few minutes and reply to commands in seconds. This would make using the device practical and not a test of patience. Second, I wanted it to be easy to assemble for anyone. This meant no components with tight spacing, no components with too many pins, and no components with contacts hidden underneath them. A part of this wish was also that someone could actually assemble one, meaning ",

The comments section quickly transforms into the typical nerd Colosseum where the price is king, coolness is relative, and any achievement can be promptly dismissed by comparing it to Apple's shiny gizmos.

She said maybe she could do a game. At the time I was working in Microsoft C++ and the Microsoft Foundation Classes framework, building Windows apps. She had never programmed a language more challenging than Turbo Pascal.When she asked how long it would take to even get started, I estimated about 18 months to learn C++ properly, another six months to learn Microsoft foundation classes. The six months after that to learn the windows API if she worked really hard at it. At the time I thought maybe there was a place in the Windows game market for a mini golf game.She took less than a week to create a working, bug-free prototype, but then lost interest.I hate people like that!

Allegedly it is supposed to reduce noisy neighbour effects in multi tenanted environments.It would be interesting if kubernetes had stronger CPU isolation techniques. There is the static cpu manager which will dedicate cores for a specific container but I believe it isn\u2019t smart enough to know about hyperthreads and so you can still get a noisy neighbour running on the other hyperthread of the core.Ideally I would like to see kubernetes slice out a certain number of cores for the system daemons/kernel, IRQs, and NIC buffers. Some very low latency systems running on top of kubernetes recommend using isolcpus to do this but it would be nice to have something built into the kubernetes CPU manager to do this. A container running inside the guaranteed QoS class should have exclusive access to the cores and never be pre-empted.\n \nreply",

      "Yep. In Netflix case each Titus host can run hundreds of containers per bare-metal instance at any given time. One advantage of running a multi-tenant platform like this is that you get better observability on multi-tenancy issues since you're doing the scheduling yourself and know who is collocated with who. It's much harder to debug noisy-neighbor issues when it's happening on the cloud provider side and your caches get thrashed by random other AWS customers.One thing I was pitching internally when advocating for this platform is that when you have the scale to run it for the economics to make sense, you can reclaim some of AWS margins instead of having your cold tiny VMs subsidize other AWS customers higher perf. If you run the multi-tenant platform yourself, you can oversubscribe every app in a way that makes sense for your business and trade latency or throughput of software for $ on a per-container basis, so you can make much more granular and optimal decisions globally. VS having each team individually right-size their own app deployed on VMs and sharing CPU caches with randos.I remember once at Netflix we investigated a weird latency issue on a random load balancer instance and got AWS involved: it turned out to be a noisy-neighbor on the underlying VM that gets chopped up into multiple customer-facing LB instances.\n \nreply"

      "In iommi we built something imo much smarter: https://docs.iommi.rocks/en/latest/dev_tools.html#sql-traceThe idea is that:1. We store all the stack traces and SQL calls2. At the end of the request we group them to find N+13. If there are any N+1 (given some threshold), we print a big warning to stdout. Full traceback for one of the SQL calls and a few examples of SQL.This is imo MUCH better. It means the console is silent when there is no issue. It also means the console is loud when there IS an issue. And the output you get is very helpful.This approach is better than the one in the article, and superior to Django Debug Toolbar where you have to actively go look for problems instead of the machine telling you.\n \nreply",
      "Heh, wrote something similar (django-queryinspect) a while ago, then abandoned it since iirc django debug toolbar has it builtin, and I moved to some other stuff.. maybe I should dust it off.N+1 is fairly well understood and documented gotcha, and Django has excellent tools that make it easy to avoid it (as the article mentions).To use Django ORM effectively in nontrivial apps, you do need to understand how relational databases work, and it's helpful to understand SQL. But it does make me a whole lot more productive (and happy!) than writing SQL by hand.\n \nreply",
      "Not knowing anything about web development or Django or whatever, why isn't this just in a real database? Where you can do a join instead of 2000 individual queries?\n \nreply",
      "Object Relational Mappers like the one Django use are a whole topic of debate unto themselves.They strive to map SQL concepts into a more code-friendly domain. Rows are represented as objects, references become attributes of those objects which can be eager-loaded by a join when you fetch the parent object or lazy-loaded with their own query when they are actually accessed. The N+1 problem comes from this lazy-loading scenario.This programming model abstracts away the SQL which can be really cool and easy until you try to do something off the beaten path. Junior devs love it for the ease, and diving into the internals once things go wrong turns them into Senior devs!\n \nreply",
      "Coming from an area of programming where dataframes/tables are the first-class citizen this is mind blowing to me. Is there a reason for doing things this way by default? I guess it puts off having to think about complex queries, but it also means performance is degraded multiplicatively the more tables you're pulling in, right? Is the tradeoff really just \"it's easier to set up any old garbage and fix performance later\"?\n \nreply",
      "Lazy-loading is usually the default ORM setting, so you wouldn't pull in any extra tables by default. You can setup Eager-loading on a per-query basis (i.e I know I'll need it here) or just set up certain relationship to always eager-load, depending on your needs.You've hit the tradeoff right on the nail. ORM-based code is dead-simple to write since everything just looks like an object. Anyone who knows the programming language can start querying the DB without really knowing anything about SQL. This lets you write the code quickly and in a domain thats really easy to reason about.I've seen many times where an endpoint might really only require 1 SQL query but it turns into a handful because of the ORM. Very rarely does it matter though, because each query takes < 5 milliseconds and you barely notice the slowdown.If you know your ORM library well then you can get the benefits of both worlds. Mature ORMs will give you a ton of control (including letting you write SQL directly) when you need, you just have to be ok with the learning curve.\n \nreply",
      "Columns though, you do have to restrict the column set if you don't want/need them all.It's dead simple to do dead simple, and then it quickly gets hard to impossible to do the complex things you need, is my experience with Django ORM.My favourite model personally is a very lightweight mapping into a model in the querying language, like Diesel or less. Django unnecessarily changes established terminology and introduces abstractions that are ultimately limiting.\n \nreply",
      "IME, it\u2019s more because most (citation needed) web devs are familiar with JSON and its nested format, and so it\u2019s much easier to keep everything in that mental model, and let something else do the conversion.SQL is of course not a difficult language, but I will give ORMs that it can be somewhat difficult to context switch between the two mental models.Django, IME, does an extremely good job at producing decent SQL, most of the time. There are times when you can be faster, and there are certainly times where it\u2019s massively slower, but the average is higher than if you just had everyone writing queries.My counter to that is \u201chave RDBMS SMEs create VIEWs for anything you want, and let devs just call those,\u201d but then I get told I\u2019m old-fashioned, and that no one wants to store any kind of logic in a DB, version controlled or not.\n \nreply",
      "Django queries are an interface to a real relational database.  It's not its own thing.The tradeoff Django chose was lazy loading by default over automatically pulling the entire database by following every foreign key.One of the standard fixes is to tell it to do JOINs for specific foreign keys instead of lazy loading (select_related(), mentioned but not shown in the article).\n \nreply",
      "You can do joins in Django just fine, and you can even NOT write them and have Django automagically do the correct thing if you know how to use it.\n \nreply"

This was during a 3 month leave from work, starting from zero knowledge beforehand. It was probably the most fun I've had in years, and mostly thanks to how slick Fusion is and how many tutorials there are out there.There are some export formats that it uses cloud machines for, which I think is silly and arbitrary. It's probably done that way to upsell their premium product for faster wait times or unlimited quota.

Not as a metaphor for integrity or quality.Integrity isn't the point:> It had nothing to do with integrity. I didn\u2019t care about fooling the diners. What concerned me was the precedent we were setting.The quality of the food isn't the point either:> The dish was meant to be a difficult pickup that required constant coordination between the front and back of house.The inefficiency is the point.Doing it the long, hard and stupid way is the point.This is a sermon against process improvements. Without seeming to realize that restaurants are a modern miracle of process improvements! How does this David think the kitchen gets fresh ingredients every morning? Where does David think fruit in the winter comes from? How did herbs and spices get so cheap? Because we decided for the past 200 years to relentlessly pursue efficiency. Because we decided not to do things the slow and stupid way any more. That's how!\n \nreply",
      "> For example, one of my favorite Majordomo dishes is a whole boiled chicken. We present the bird to the table in a big pot, bring it back to the kitchen to carve it, and then return with a beautiful platter of rice topped with the sliced breasts and two different sauces spooned over the top. Once guests are finished with that, we bring out a soup made from the carcass. It\u2019s so good.The point is that the diner gets to see the chicken they will eat and understand the process.The efficient way described in the blog is to instead use a stunt chicken which'll be paraded around the dining room instead of being cooked.That's not a process improvement when the entire point of the dish is to show the diners what they will eat before they eat it and flex the restaurant's ability to coordinate.Purposeful inefficiency is beautiful when it's about retro video game console programming or mechanical watches, because that's about spotlighting the process. Both of these are inefficient---modern computers are more powerful and quartz watch keep time better---but are fascinating because the difficulty of programming in assembly or an intricate series of tiny gears have inherent value to some people, far beyond the result of a video game or getting the current time.It's a complicated finely tuned process to get a chicken from your table to the kitchen and back again. The chef wants employees that value the process itself, which is a fair ask when the process is the product.\n \nreply",
      "\"Once guests are finished with that, we bring out a soup made from the carcass.\"Soup from the carcass is delicious, but there isn't time to do that during the meal. Even with a pressure cooker it's going to take at least an hour. (And if several tables order the same dish, you're gonna have a bunch of pressure cookers in your kitchen.)So... the idea is sound, but I'm doubtful that they actually do it the way they claim. Which would make sense with the \"hero chicken\" story they admit to.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, I'm totally with you on this one. I think they make a stock from the carcasses of previous day's chickens. What Chang is claiming doesn't make sense.\n \nreply",
      "Hmmm, that like the \"inefficiency\" of advertisements with lots of empty space, and fancy stores with sparse interiors.In other words, it's not actual inefficiency so much as a hard-to-recognize spending on buying another asset, namely  the marketing/advertising effect of conveying \"luxury\" or \"successfulness\".Sort of like peacock feathers: They're \"inefficient\" from the perspective of abstract aerodynamics, but from a holistic and practical perspective...\n \nreply",
      "And yet, he says \"... I didn\u2019t care about fooling the diners.\"I agree with you, that the diner seeing what they are about to eat is an important part of the experience. But Chang seems to be saying that even that is not the point! The results (including diner experience, and the honesty of that experience) don't matter. It is purely about instilling and maintaining a culture.I don't really buy it, myself. Should they also forge all their knives from iron ore, the long slow way, before being allowed to use them in the kitchen? As other people commented, I think this is more about weaving a story and casting a glamour than anything else.\n \nreply",
      "I think a charitable interpretation of his point is \"I didn't care about fooling the diners about this specific thing.\"But if he allows that to happen and the staff internalizes a culture of corner-cutting and misdirection, then eventually they'll start lying to customers and taking shortcuts on things that do matter.\n \nreply",
      "I would describe it as \"founder mode\". If he lets the restaurant morph its process while he is outside the kitchen the vision is lost.Obviously young and hungry with nothing to lose but your standards one can make certain decisions that build the story and the quality.Once the weekly payroll is $140k a week plus all the other expenses selling one's name seems justified to keep the balls in the air.The problem is the idea of the billionaire chef.\n \nreply",
      "So, the idea is the long, hard, stupid and disrespectful way.Basically, the idea is you don't want smart people who can decide what corners make sense to cut, what process to use to etc.And this is because you don't want to have to rely on their intelligence. You want to rely on only your process, so you hire those without sense or intelligence as you expand.\n \nreply",
      "> \"That was what made it great. If they wanted to sandbag it, they needed to figure out how they would make up for the lost energy elsewhere.\"This seems to be the key quote. As a restaurant owner, as with any other type of team leader, his job is managing how the team's attention and energy is spent. Reading charitably, he doesn't want to formalize slack time into the system, because he thinks that slack will be eaten up by something else with the next process change, making the whole operation more brittle (also specifically in a restaurant setting, maximizing kitchen throughput is _not_ the same as maximizing efficient operation)I could of course be reading too much into this, but from my own experience, it's the same difference between a sensible ad hoc meeting culture and being forced to use \"efficiency\" tools that inevitably make meetings less productive.\n \nreply"

      "I'd say that's a very reasonable and very good idea. I've implemented similar ideas in many other systems. Batching in general always reduces the per-entry overhead. It's easy to prove this via a benchmark. You can even put all the batched items in a single transaction. And since you are batching, you essentially will always have one thread that's getting the batch and actually doing the write, perfectly matched with SQLite's limitation of one concurrent write at a time.What you need to worry about is slightly higher complexity: (1) what happens when a single batched write doesn't complete within one second; (2) what is the size of queue you store events in memory and whether it is unbounded or not; (3) if it is unbounded are you confident that overloading the server won't cause it to be killed by OOM (queueing theory says when the arrival rate is too high the queue size becomes infinite so there must be another mechanism to push back), and if it is bounded are you comfortable with dropping entries; (4) if you do decide to drop entries from a bounded queue, which entries you drop; (5) for a bounded queue what its limit is. These are very necessary questions that arise in almost every system that needs queueing. Thinking about these questions not only help you in this instance, but also in many other future scenarios you may encounter.\n \nreply",

      "DC-DC converters are hard, but fun. The basic concept is that when you put current through an inductor for a while, then disconnect it, you get a big voltage spike. That's a classic auto ignition system. You can put that spike through a diode and use it to charge a capacitor to get DC out. The neat thing about switching power supplies is that there's very little resistance in the power path. That's why the efficiencies are so good. The not-neat thing is that they are a dead short across the input for part of the cycle, which is why failures can cause fires and why you may need an inrush current limiter and/or a fuse.There are boost converters, buck converters, and ones with transformers. With a transformer you can isolate the input from the output, which is mandatory for safety if you're driving the thing from the AC power line.Here's one of mine. USB 5VDC in, 120 VDC out, to operate antique teletype machines that need 60mA 120VDC.[1] The basic circuit is simple, but there are multiple surface mount ferrite beads and small capacitors to keep the spikes from coming out via the input USB, output, or as RF. LTspice simulation was needed to pick the values for those, so as to minimize noise in both voltage and current.[1] https://github.com/John-Nagle/ttyloopdriver/blob/master/boar...\n \nreply",
      "> The basic concept is that when you put current through an inductor for a while, then disconnect it, you get a big voltage spike.That's actually usually not true, as the vast majority of DC to DC converters are step-down converters: you do not want the voltage to spike. And in general, it isn't really a \"spike\".A better way to think about what is happening is that passing a current from a power supply through an inductor transfers energy into the magnetic field. When you stop doing that, the magnetic field diminishes, transferring energy back into current. But this time, you direct the current into the circuit.The trick is that by picking the timing and other parameters correctly, you can pick the voltage of the downstream current. Specifically, you can do this because the voltage across the inductor is a function of the slope of the strength of the magnetic field around the wire in the inductor. Pick a different slope, and you can pick a different voltage. Since you usually want a stable voltage, the graph of the magnetic field strength will be (roughly) a sawtooth, and the graph of the induced voltage will be (roughly) a square wave (I am simplifying here for understandability!). A sawtooth shape has a consistent current slope, which leads to a consistent voltage.\n \nreply",

Here\u2019s how you can build it and how it works.## Materials:- 9-volt battery- Step-up transformer (designed to increase voltage)\\_ consider a flyback transformer from old CRT or auto ignition coil, talk to circuit electrician expert- Switch (spring-loaded or pressure-based)- Wires- Small box (to hold the circuit)- Electrical tape- Conductive foil or metal strips for accessible sides of box## How It Works:This circuit uses a step-up transformer coil to generate a small electric shock when someone picks up the box. While transformers typically work with alternating current (AC), here you use direct current (DC) from the 9-volt battery. The trick happens when the circuit opens as the box is lifted, causing the transformer\u2019s magnetic field to collapse and induce a voltage spike.When the box is lifted, the switch opens, cutting off the current from the battery. This sudden interruption collapses the transformer\u2019s magnetic field, generating a quick, harmless jolt.## Steps to Build:1. Assemble the Circuit:- Connect the 9-volt battery to the primary side of the transformer, with a switch in between. The switch should stay closed when the box is at rest and open when it\u2019s picked up.- Wire the secondary side of the transformer to two sets of exposed contact points on the outside of the box: one set connected to the positive side and the other set to the negative side of the transformer.2. Add Conductive Surfaces:- To make it more effective, cover three sides or faces of the box with conductive material (like aluminum foil or metal strips) connected to the positive output of the transformer. Then cover the opposite three sides with conductive material connected to the negative output of the transformer.- When someone picks up the box, their hands will naturally touch both a positive and negative side, allowing the shock to pass through them.3. Install the Switch:- Position the switch on the underside of the box so that it opens when the box is lifted. You can use a spring-loaded or pressure-based switch that triggers when the box is moved.4. Test the Circuit:- With the box resting, the current will flow through the transformer, building up a magnetic field. Once someone lifts the box, the circuit breaks, causing the field to collapse and induce the shock.5. Secure the Box:- Place and affix all the components securely inside the box, bringing your two wires through the sides and making sure the exposed contact points are positioned on opposite sides of the box. Tape down any loose wires.## Science Explanation:This project uses Faraday\u2019s Law of Induction, which states that a changing magnetic field induces voltage. The transformer converts the collapsing magnetic field into a brief, high-voltage spike, delivering a small shock to whatever is completing the high side circuit when the low side circuit is opened. Although transformers usually work with AC, you\u2019re using the moment when the DC current stops to mimic that effect.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_inductionThe conductive material on the box ensures that when someone lifts the box, their hands make contact with both the positive and negative sides, completing the circuit for the jolt.## Safety Note:When done correctly, this project delivers a tiny, harmless jolt, similar to static electricity. Always use low power, an appropriate transformer, and avoid using higher voltages or currents.  Consult with a TV repair expert or similar on your design before starting.  DO NOT TOUCH ASSEMBLED CRTs.  Let the TV repair person do it. She'll have parts anyway.\n \nreply",

      "> A better way to think about what is happening is that passing a current from a power supply through an inductor transfers energy into the magnetic field. When you stop doing that, the magnetic field diminishes, transferring energy back into current. But this time, you direct the current into the circuit.That's not my understanding of how down-converters work.Rather, there's a big fat output capacitor that the load is connected to, and you keep topping off its charge with a MOSFET gated by a feedback loop that monitors the capacitor's voltage and actively adjusts the PWM duty cycle to keep the capacitor charged at the desired voltage regardless of what the load does. If you your input is 100V and your desired output is 10V, you just keep charging a capacitor to 10V, disconnect when it gets to 10V, and keep repeating that at hundreds of kHz, faster than the load can appreciably drain the capacitor. Inductors and diodes are \"optional\", but added to absorb current spikes. Their main principle doesn't rely on induction though.Boost converters, on the other hand, rely on inductors to achieve higher output voltages than the input.\n \nreply"

The main reason I found iron gall ink fascinating, was that the ink is described as being common and widespread, but made from something I had never heard of - or, at least, paid attention to. I like oak trees and acorns, and I'm quite sure I've never seen a gall. I think if I had, it would seem like an incredible thing for a tree to produce, until I heard the explanation about the wasps.Galls remind me of bagworm moths (1). I saw one for the first time a couple of years ago, and it absolutely felt like encountering an alien creature until I found out what they are.

I had to read the entire wikipedia article to have a basic understanding which took me 5 minutes, but I asked chatgpt \"do tree galls have more nutrition or otherwise differ from the other parts of a tree?\" and \"how does the organism causing the gall manipulate the tree's growth process?\" and got really detailed correct-sounding responses.\n \nreply",

    "first_paragraph": "\nIron gall ink (also known as common ink, standard ink, oak gall ink or iron gall nut ink) is a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from vegetable sources. It was the standard ink formulation used in Europe for the 1400-year period between the 5th and 19th centuries, remained in widespread use well into the 20th century, and is still sold today.\nThe ink was traditionally prepared by adding some iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) to a solution of tannic acid, but any iron ion donor can be used. The gallotannic acid was usually extracted from oak galls or galls of other trees, hence the name. Fermentation or hydrolysis of the extract releases glucose and gallic acid, which yields a darker purple-black ink, due to the formation of iron gallate.[1]\nThe fermented extract was combined with the iron(II) sulfate. After filtering, the resulting pale-grey solution had a binder added to it (most commonly gum arabic) and was used to write on paper or parchment. A well-prepa",
