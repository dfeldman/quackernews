    "first_paragraph": "We are working on a new scheme to replace the GRUB bootloader with a fast, secure, Linux-based, user-space solution: nmbl (for no more boot loader).\nMost people are familiar with GRUB, a powerful, flexible, fully-featured bootloader that is used on multiple architectures (x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le OpenFirmware). Although GRUB is quite versatile and capable, its features create complexity that is difficult to maintain, and that both duplicate and lag behind the Linux kernel while also creating numerous security holes. On the other hand, the Linux kernel, which has a large developer base, benefits from fast feature development, quick responses to vulnerabilities and greater overall scrutiny.\nWe (Red Hat boot loader engineering) will present our solution to this problem, which is to use the Linux kernel as its own bootloader. Loaded by the EFI stub on UEFI, and packed into a unified kernel image (UKI), the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line, contain everything they need to reach th",
    "summary": "Today, a group of high-minded, Red Hat wizards unveil their master plan to obliterate GRUB and reinvent the bootloadosphere with <em>nmbl</em>\u2014because who wouldn't want the overhead of an entire kernel pre-boot? As expected, the read-between-the-lines promise of \"secure\" and \"fast\" beckons the arrival of yet another technological marvel we never knew we desperately needed. The comment section, a veritable battleground of caffeinated sysadmins and distro warriors, quickly devolves into arcane squabbles over performance graphs and nostalgic tales of LILO. Really, if the stability and security of your entire system hinge on this debate, maybe just keep that dusty old GRUB floppy at hand. \ud83d\ude44"
