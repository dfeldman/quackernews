The HN crowd, in a dazzling exhibition of missing the point, dives into a jargon-tossing festival, comparing the tool to everything from the Hubble Telescope to their favorite brand of biodegradable yoga mats. Brace yourselves for a flood of comments where everyone ignores the actual utility of seeing things you don't understand and instead, races to suggest features that would make it even less comprehensible. Who needs X-ray vision when you have the ability to overcomplicate tools with features you read about five minutes ago in another Show HN thread?"

Divisions are created based on the best times recorded by each player, with Division 1 hosting the fastest 64 players, Division 2 hosting the next fastest 64, and so on.
