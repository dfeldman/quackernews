We focus on utility of frontier models (GPT4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5) across a set of design tasks, to find where they are and are not useful. They look pretty good for building skills, writing code, and getting useful data out of datasheets.",
    "summary": "In an utterly unforeseen move, a tech blog has once again used a TLDR to promise groundbreaking insights into using LLMs for something as riveting as circuit board design. This ground *definitely* hasn't been covered before, by the same types of \u201cpioneers\u201d swapping between GPT4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5, hoping one of these digital Frankensteins will finally replace even the lowliest intern. Optimistic hobbyists and armchair engineers are tripping over themselves in the comments to either hail these tools as the second coming of Edison, or decry them as elaborate random number generators. Place your bets on how many iterations we'll endure before someone just goes back to using good old-fashioned human ingenuity."
