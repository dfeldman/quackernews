This has a throughput and recovery time penalty and obviously it compounds the longer they are in that mode.I think what we're finding with the Southwest meltdown and now the Delta meltdown is that the big airlines just don't have the manpower or scheduling slack to accommodate going into business continuity.

      "Re DeltaIt's not so much a severity as \"hard\"; but with the hub and spoke model that Delta uses, scheduling being down (at all on Friday), combined with FAA hour limits. It becomes exponentially difficult to reschedule flights.Put more plainly, on Friday, your scheduling software is down for 4 hours in the morning, so you \"borrow\" any replacements you need for employees that are late or sick. This ruins the availability for the next flights, at which time you hope the system is up again; but if it's not, you borrow from the evening flights. Combine this with each flight that was late/cancelled as you were hoping to fill now affects the hours available for the employees that were available. Finally, as you've cascaded this, you head into a weekend trying to catalog how many hours each crew member did or did not log, and you're not sure how to get them back in time.\n \nreply",

Then start rebooking passengers and picking up the pieces. Carriers with long haul international may need longer, and maybe you need more rest days to ensure everyone is ready for their normal shift, but that's a reasonable napkin estimate.Otoh, Delta seemed to have recovered after about a week, and canceled about 1,000 out of about 4,000 flights for several days.

      "We're building a new multiplayer editor for tasks/notes [1] which supports both text and outliner operations. Although it behaves like a flat text document, the outliner features essentially turn the document into a large tree under the hood. We do something similar to the highly-available move operation to sync changes:There is one operation to change the tree, called insmov (move-or-insert). Whenever a client is online it can sync changes C to a server. Whenever the server has remote changes for us, it will send us back a list R of all changes since our last sync in a global linear order. We then undo any of the insmovs in our changeset C, and (re)apply all changes in R + any new changes we didn't sync yet.We don't use any fractional indices though. Instead, our insmov tuple not only contains a parent P, but also a previous sibling guid A. Because all tree ops will eventually be applied in the global linear order as determined by the server, \"sorting\" is handled by just using the insmov operation.Most of the time the undo'ing of operations is not needed though. Only when the server has insmov changes we don't know about while we are sending new insmovs ourselves do we need to ensure we replay the operations in the correct order. That's likely to happen when you reconnect to wifi after a long flight, but not so likely when updates are pushed in real-time over websocket when you're online (plus it's not needed for non-insmov operations, like updating text).[1] https://thymer.com\n \nreply",

The algorithm has high performance and can be used in production.In distributed systems and collaborative software, managing hierarchical relationships is difficult and complex. Challenges arise in resolving conflicts and meeting user expectations when working with the data structure that models movement by combining deletion and insertion. For instance, if a node is concurrently moved to different parents in replicas, it may lead to the unintended creation of duplicate nodes with the same content. Because the node is deleted twice and created under two parents.Currently, many software solutions offer different levels of support and functionality for managing hierarchical data structures in distributed environments.

      "Congrats on the launch!  Been using your free product for a little while.  As a fellow traffic hacker, some random comments:  - I've been in the points game for a long time so I may not be your target customer.  Take feedback with a grain of salt, I guess.\n\n  - Commissions & Trust: You should disclose (more clearly?) that you're getting commissions from the CC signups and, ideally, that those may not be the best offers available.  (ex as of this comment, referrals are paying 90K to sign up whereas your link is at 60K-an almost $300 difference).  I understand this is a huge revenue driver, but that's not an excuse for shilling affiliate links where the user loses out on real, actual money.\n\n  - Last Refresh: Would be nice to know when the last refresh was.  I've clicked a few times for available seats and found that the airline did not actually have the flights available.  As a user, this erodes trust in your results.\n\n  - Slider: Points min/max slider interface isn't great but honestly I can't think of an alternative.  1 AA point is not the same as 1 Asiana point.\n\n  - Program coverage: Your tool coverage seems similar to the other cached searching tools (Seats.aero, award logic, etc) but, honestly, needs improvement.  Most airlines are quickly moving towards releasing more inventory to their own members, so coverage is much more important now than it was two years ago. As an example, Singapore Air very rarely releases ex-US business class awards to partners but releases them much more reliably to their own members.\n\n  - Alerts: I understand this is part of \"SkyView\" but you should make it more prominent and clearly marketed.  Alerts are *super duper useful* and give your product direct, permissioned access to a user's email and/or SMS that they actually want!  This is what differentiates you from Point.me and the airline searches and also what gave ExpertFlyer its edge for so long.  My guess is making it more prominent will drive more subscribers.\n \nreply",
      "Thank you! Love more feedback, especially from travel hackers.1) You're right. We have Advertiser Disclosures on all other pages, but will make the disclosures more prominent. Going to push out a change today/tomorrow. Affiliate commissions are not a big revenue driver right now.2) We're working on a new design so the last refresh is more prominent. Currently, you'll be able to see the \"Update ## ago\" when you either expand the flight details or click into the full flight details page.If are using the Roame live search, then it should be the instant you search. Please let me know if you are running into issues with live search results not showing up on the airline website.If you are using SkyView or Discover cached search, we pull results and save them up to 4 days or so. This is to help users plan and search broadly across regions and dates.3) Agreed. We try to simplify the UI for points beginners. Thought it would be too confusing to try to estimate AA vs. Asiana vs. United, etc. The value of the points would also depend on which fare class and route you want to take. If you someone only wanted to fly US to Japan in JAL, then AA miles would be gold. But if someone wanted to fly US to Paris, then Air France/Flying Blue miles would be gold even though they are easy to earn because all the CC points transfer to Air France.4) We're working on adding more loyalty program coverage. Our free tool is in real-time though, so slightly different than the cached tools. We do have a cached tool called SkyView.5) This is good feedback.

      "Edit: not sure if your comment was meant for me or timqin. Leaving it up just for general awarenessGeneral tips:  - Never carry a balance, ever.  If you do, forget about playing this game because it'll cost you more than you gain.  Pay off your CC debt first.\n  - There are many blogs/sites that push \"their\" link over ones that pay more to the user because they get paid a hefty affiliate fee.  Be wary.\n  - Have a goal in mind before you accrue points so you can be more strategic about accruing.  I recommend starting with a list of all the trips you'd like to take in the next two years and using that to frame what points you will need to accrue.  Don't forget hotels as the cost of hotels can easily outweigh the cost of flights.\n  - Figure out how much work you want to put in.  There are levels to the game-the deeper you go, the more work it will be.  It will also get that much more rewarding\n  - Prioritize transferable currencies (UR, MR, Cap1, TYP, etc) because devaluations happen often and transferrable currencies help insulate a bit.\n  - Try to get your partner on board if at all possible, having a second (third, fourth, etc...) player (P2-P100+) is a scaling super power\n  - Keep in mind the \"burning\" side of the equation and use them often.  Points and miles are worthless bits of made up paper dressed up as currency and subject to the whims of corporations that don't have your best interests in mind.  Treat them as such.\n  \n\nMy general strategy for a (US based) newbie is:  1. Read above, create a strategy and an ordered list of cards\n  2. Sign up for the credit cards and put all your organic spend on those credit cards to meet spend.\n  3. Repeat 1 & 2 after meeting spend and gaining sign up bonus\n  4. If you have another player available, switch between players every time you meet the spend and get the bonus to lower your velocity and appear \"safer\"\n  5. You might also want to get a (minimum) 2% everywhere card for everything you can't put on the new cards.\n\nIt can get a bit difficult as the minimum spend requirements can be high.  There are many strategies out on the web that can help with this.For a couple using this strategy, you'll be averaging ~2 new CC's per person per year (which is very safe) and earning ~7-10ish percent back on most spend.  After a year or so of doing this, you should have enough for a vacation or two.\n \nreply",
      "Thanks, great info.I never accrued points wiht my CC. Is it really worth it compared to 1-2% cash back? I just collected by flying. You have to ask yourself: What do I want to achieve?1. Fly free with points2. Have gold status and access to the lounge, more luggage, faster check-in1 is hard. It basically makes only sense if you really fly a lot and your company pays for it. 2 is easier, IF you chose the right airlines to collect points. This is a science but take this as a start: https://www.wheretocredit.com/At one time I had all three alliances gold elite status (or equivalent). But I flew very  little for free or discounted with points.It always depends on your situation. But I had Turkish (Star Alliance) gold. And if I flew via Asia to Europe with Ethiopian Airlines via Addis Ababa (with nice stay overs), TK shitted me with points.\n \nreply",
      "Agree 100% everyone should ask what you want to achieve before even considering starting.  General archetypical goals of travel hackers I've seen are:  1. Maximum number of trips\n  2. Minimum cost for trips (cheap or free travel)\n  3. Free or discounted luxury travel (business class, luxury hotels, etc)\n  4. Maximum cash back (to the point of being a full time job)\n  5. Maximizing elite status (for business travel, etc)\n  6. Short term, saving up for one or two big bangs (honeymoon, bucket list item, etc)\n  7. Any combination of above and more.\n\n\nEach one of those goals require a different strategy.  If you're aiming for maximum cash back, I personally think the work involved in the CC game would be worth the time but everyone is different. A sign up bonus generally represents 7-10% cash back on the bonus spend so I'm ok with spending a bit of time updating spreadsheets and keeping track.On the other hand, I have some friends who do not want to bother due to the stress and overhead involved (finances can be difficult).  For those types, I usually recommend foregoing the CC game and putting everything on a no annual fee 2% card.\n \nreply",

      "For some functions you can turn the Taylor series into a recurrence relation, which makes it blazing fast to calculate.For instance for the family of functions f(x0,x1,...) = exp(poly(x0,x1,...)), where poly is a multivariate polynomial of order m, you can compute the Taylor coefficients with a recurrence relation of order m (that needs to look back m steps). This shows up in quantum optics, for example.\n \nreply",
      "One of the things that has always seemed rather magical to me is the Taylor series of the exponential function for very large negative values.  We know that a number like e^-100 is a number extremely close to zero.  Yet when you write out the Taylor series you see an alternating some of increasingly large, seemingly arbitrary numbers (at least for ~100 terms):e^-100 = 1 - 100 + 5000 - 166,666.6 + 4,166,666.6 - ...If you were just given this sum and knew nothing about Taylor series or the exponential function you'd assume that its value was some extremely large number.  Yet everything manages to cancel out just right so that the resulting sum is almost exactly zero, but not quite.I can't help but wonder if there's some parallel to parts of quantum field theory.  If you expand out the interactions between two particles you also end up with a series that is apparently divergent.  Yet we know experimentally that the first few terms work quite well as an approximation.  It feels a bit like you're looking at the series of e^-100 without knowing about the exponential function.\n \nreply",
      "The whole polynomial functions that give the truncations of the exponential Taylor series are also well-behaved in a way that's really surprising if you haven't thought about it before. For example, if you plot 1, 1 + x + x^2/2, 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24, and so on, you'll see that they actually don't oscillate at all as you might expect for negative inputs (for the reason you're saying), but rather they're very nice convex \"bowl-shaped\" positive functions, which hug zero more and more closely along the negative axis as you include more terms. One way to get some intuition about this is to notice that the derivatives of the next polynomial in the sequence are just the ones that came before (related to exp(x) being its own derivative). In particular, if all the even degree ones so far have been convex, then so will the next one be.The idea you mention at the end is not specific to something mathematically advanced like quantum field theory. Useful truncations of divergent series show up in many more elementary situations in calculus and applied math; here is a nice class taught by the excellent Steven Strogatz where he talks about a simple example in the first lecture:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZsk8B_z8pI&list=PL5EH0ZJ7V0...\n \nreply",

      "Instead of thinking of real analysis as a zoo of weird exceptions, it's probably more accurate to think of complex analyic functions as the exceptions.

      "Consider also Tube Archivist. If you just want to download a few videos it's overkill, but I use it to archive and index technical channels I like. It can do advanced full text and metadata searches on the transcription/subtitles as well as comments (and title and description). Much better than what alphabet provides, annoyingly.https://www.tubearchivist.com/\n \nreply",
      "I was looking at TubeArchivist. But didn\u2019t like that it required 3 separate containers.  Then I found Pinchflat on the selfhosted sub. It works as a single container and was easy deployment. Has been working well.https://github.com/kieraneglin/pinchflat\n \nreply",
      "Hard pass.The file naming is predicated on having the database. For ephemeral storage this is understandable but any software that describes itself as \"archival\" should assume that it will not outlive the data it is preserving.I was excited to have a PeerTube clone with download capabilities until I looked at the result. `yt-dlp` and clever configs and scripts will do the archival job properly.\n \nreply",
      "I've been meaning to migrate to tube archivist forever, but I have several TB of youtube videos I don't want to re-download which I gathered using tubesync. Luckily I have the format string used to save the files by name and since tubesync uses django and a postgres backend I might be able to tie them to the youtube ID. But migration still seems like it might be a bit of a nightmare\n \nreply",
      "Google will never make it comfortable to use their products in any structured, advanced way as it is super beneficial to the user and gives away way too much control. Google hates that.\n \nreply",

      "How does it compare to PeerTube? Would be cool if these instances could be federated, ActivityPub or something similar.\n \nreply",

      "What I\u2019d really like is a YouTube TiVo.There are about 100 channels that I watch religiously, but, release infrequently. I never want to miss a video from these channels.I also don\u2019t want to open YouTube and sift through hundreds of releases from channels that release four times/day just to find the 1-2 videos that I actually want to watch (and will inevitably miss.)Just give me a priority feed of the stuff I actually want/need to watch. If I can download everything and watch it over DLNA, even better,Making sure we don\u2019t miss the things we love isn\u2019t YouTube\u2019s M.O. Keeping the feedbag strapped to our faces while we watch someone stretch a 3 minute video into a 18-22 minute one, is.\n \nreply",
      "This feels like it's covered by YouTube subscriptions, no? Subscribe to those 100 channels, bookmark your subscriptions page, and presto! You now have a priority feed of the stuff you want to watch and nothing else.Maybe you just don't want to create an account, which is fine (NewPipe is a great fit), but it's a bit weird to see you say that \"making sure we don\u2019t miss the things we love isn\u2019t YouTube\u2019s M.O.\" when there's an entire page dedicated to a chronologically-sorted list of videos from channels you pick.\n \nreply"

    "summary": "Title: The Self-Hosting Shark Tank: MeTube vs. The World\n\nSummary: At the bleeding edge of \"not letting Google hold all my data\" comes MeTube, a self-hosted pirate ship sailing the turbulent waters of youtube-dl forks. Enthusiasts trade jabs in the comments over whether this memory-hogging, multi-container monstrosity really improves on writing ten lines of bash script. Elsewhere, loyalists of variously obscure alternatives like Tube Archivist and Pinchflat joust for the high ground of minimal database dependencies and ease of deployment. The desperation to avoid the soul-crushing experience of using actual YouTube is palpable, but the likelihood anyone will migrate from their creaky setups is as slim as Google sending you a thank-you card. \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f"

    "first_paragraph": "The Guide for Time Series Data Projects is out.CrateDB supports three search functions: kNN search via KNN_MATCH, bm25 search via MATCH, and geospatial search via MATCH.Hybrid Search is a technique that enhances relevancy and accuracy by combining the results of two or more search algorithms, achieving better accuracy and relevancy than each algorithm would individually.A common scenario is to combine semantic search (vector search) with lexical search (keyword search). Semantic search excels at understanding the context of a phrase. Lexical search is great at finding how many times a keyword or phrase appears in a document, taking into account the length and the average length of your documents.Imagine an e-commerce platform that sells tech products. The user could query: gpu ASUS or graphic card ASUS. Semantic search would understand that both gpu and graphic card refer to a graphics processing unit. If we relied solely on semantic search, we would only get results for graphic cards.",
