    "summary": "In an unprecedented display of legislative bravado, Governor Polis of Colorado transforms into a grassroots superhero by signing a bill that will supposedly let people fix their own gadgets instead of weeping softly into their overpriced warranties. Technophiles and commoners alike flood the comments, each armed with half-baked legal expertise and pure, unadulterated rage against \"Big Tech.\" One brave keyboard warrior \u2013 whose Ph.D. in YouTube tutorials goes sadly unrecognized \u2013 declares this the dawn of a new era, while others scream into the void about government overreach. Meanwhile, technicians across the state are quaking in their boots, fearful of the impending hoard of consumers armed with screwdrivers and a dangerously superficial understanding of electronics."
