      "If you like this, it's also worth looking at llama2.c[1], an implementation of the Llama 2 architecture in about 1000 lines of plain, dependency-free C, tokenizer and all. THe fact that this 960-line file and a somewhat modern C compiler is all you really need to run a state-of-the-art language model is really surprising to many.Of course, this is not all there is to a modern LLM, it would probably take another thousand lines or two to implement training, and many more than that to make it fast on all the major CPU and GPU architectures. If you want a flexible framework that lets a developer define any model you want and still goes as fast as it can, the complexity spirals.Most programmers have an intuition that duplicating a large software project from scratch, like Linux or Chromium for example, would require incredible amounts of expertise, manpower and time. It's not something that a small team can achieve in a few months. You're limited by talent, not hardware.LLMs are very different. THe code isn't that complicated, you could probably implement training and inference for a single model architecture, from scratch, on a single kind of GPU, with reasonable performance, as an individual with a background in programming and who still remembers their calculus and linear algebra, with a year or so of self study. What makes LLMs difficult is getting access to all the hardware to train them, getting the data, and being able to preprocess that data.",
      "One other thing to add is large-scale RLHF. Big Tech can pay literally hundreds of technically-sophisticated people throughout the world (e.g. college grads in developing countries) to improve LLM performance on all sorts of specific problems. It is not a viable way to get AGI, but it means your LLM can learn tons of useful tricks that real people might want, and helps avoid embarrassing \"mix broken glass into your baby formula\" mistakes. (Obviously it is not foolproof.)I suspect GPT-4's \"secret sauce\" in terms of edging out competitors is that OpenAI is better about managing data contractors than the other folks. Of course it's a haze of NDAs to learn specifics, and clearly the contractors are severely underpaid compared to OpenAI employees/executives. But a lone genius with a platinum credit card can't create a new world-class LLM without help from others.",

Combine this with the letter a, which has a top entry stroke, so the oa will join at the top, whereas ea will join from bottom to top.",

      "Awesome work, and I'm glad you could post some results! I'm hoping to get time to delid one, put on a peltier cooler, and try to control the temperature a little better for a run to see how high it'll go before either burning up or going unstable.From my testing on clocks on the Pi 5, it looks like the default clock of 2.4 GHz is pretty close to the sweet spot for this chip (BCM2712), and you burn a lot of power for small incremental gains after that[1]. (Which you seem to also show with the 3.3 GHz overclock!).I also spoke to one of the Pi engineers about the chip behavior at higher clocks, and he suggested unlike some chips, this chip might run more stably at higher temperatures (like 50-60\u00b0C) rather than 'as cold as you can get it'. So that poses some challenges since most cooling solutions aren't tuned for 'keep a temperature' but instead 'get it as cold as possible', without a lot of manual tweaking.[1] https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-unde...",
      "Is there a consensus on the best available cooler for the Pi 5? I looked at this exact unit but wanted more of a \"case\" design.I first tried the Flirc passive case. It seems to transport and dissipate heat notably better than active coolers with copper heatsinks and 4000 RPM fans. That's especially impressive given that the entire top and bottom are plastic, leaving the horizontal edge as the only surface for heat dissipation.My remaining concern there is that it only cools the Broadcom SoC, while creating a nice little insulated oven for the other chips. The inner surface area is much greater than the outer surface area, and with no ventilation by design, so heat from the SoC is being distributed throughout the whole inner volume.I also tried an active cooler to avoid that, which I'm sure is better for every other chip but I'm surprised to find was substantially worse for the SoC itself. I guess the tiny copper block gets saturated very quickly and its surface area isn't very large for air cooling.Maybe that's why the monoblock passive coolers do so well, in theory they combine the best of these approaches. I just wish they'd apply the same idea to a refined \"case\" design like the Flirc.",

      "When General MIDI standard sounds became widespread in early-mid 90s I already wet my feet with synthesizers, samplers and the Amiga .MOD scene, so I was eager to try this new format and its standard library of sounds, but was surprised how absolutely awful they sounded compared to pretty much everything I used, cheap keyboards included. No way I would swap any of my cheap synthesizers with a MT32 or any similar expander. I may have a very unpopular opinion, but hated those sounds since day one, and still hate them. The demos linked sound just terrible to my ears; you can't make a general purpose sound and expect it to fit any song in any genre as much as you can't have a single type of cheese and expect it to be good in all meals. I completely understand the reason why they existed, but no, I don't feel any nostalgia.",
      "Agreed, the MT32 sounded very bad, but it inspired a scene of MIDI enthusiasts and companies making countless MIDI song files for popular and classical music that travelled via floppy discs and bulletin board systems. And the MT32 was kind of GM before GM - and its drum note assignments can still be found in the bones of some of the most recent and ambitious beat making plugins.So I value the MT32 as an historic technology culture enabler, rather than as a sonic treasure.That being said, I should run mine through my guitar pedalboard and see if it can be made to sound cool. :-)",
      "I think things changed a bit with MIDI with the introduction of Soundfonts, and even more with dedicated MIDI sound cards.I bought a Roland SCC-1 [1], and fell in love with MIDI. It was basically a CM-300 in a PCI card. I could program music that sounded like it was coming from a Roland keyboard. Such good memories.But like you, I also was not a fan of FM produced MIDI, and that was only exacerbated by the SCC-1.Soundfonts made it possible for games like FF7 to sound identical to the PS1, which was miles ahead of FM MIDI.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_SC-55",
      "FM synthesis on consumer MIDI sound cards only sounded dull because it had fewer operators than a professional synthesizer.",
      "It's a common misconception that GM has to sound bad. Consumer GM units used the smallest sound ROMs they could get away with, lower quality DACs, etc. But you could fire up GM on your Kurzweil K2000, your Quadrasynth, your Roland, or Yamaha professional level synthesizers and workstations and the same GM programs would sound amazing.For less than a higher end Sound Canvas, you can get a real professional synth with a much bigger and better sound ROM, better DACs, better effects, etc.",
      "I totally agree with you. I hated them from day one. Sounds to clean and polished.",
      "> as much as you can't have a single type of cheese and expect it to be good in all mealsYou clearly haven't tried Kerrygold's Dubliner cheese, then ;)",
      "> In this, the year 2025, minijack MIDI is now fairly common, but in the 90\u2019s it was all DIN, all the time",
      "In 1996 Yamaha was all about TwinVQ (which was far better than mp3 at low bitrates) anyway, so it'd have been that rather than mp3, had they gone that route.",

      "I remember being really excited about the derive-a-compiler-from-a-partial-evaluator premise when I first ran across it. You genuinely do get a compiler from an interpreter plus a partial evaluator. That trick does work.The gotcha I didn't spot at the time is that a compiler is (I think, could be argued either way) easier to write than a partial evaluator. The \"get it for free bit\" only really applies if someone else gave you the partial evaluator and if you somehow don't need to spend ages debugging why that partial evaluator isn't behaving like you hoped.Now that I'm somewhat more beaten down by toolchain dev, I'm starting to think compilers are easier to write than interpreters. It's definitely not a clear win in favour of the interpreter. If you compile to x64, or to C, or to javascript or whatever, you now have a thing you can debug with whatever tools are native to that target. If you run in an interpreter, you get to debug that interpreter running the program, with whatever somewhat ad hoc debugging tools you put into the interpreter yourself.Getting useful semantic error message out of an interpreter at partial evaluation time (aka the \"compile time\" of the aggregate tool) is probably solvable but not likely to work out of the box. Partial eval isn't really a phase separation friendly thing.",
      "This is indeed a good point and something I want to write about when I eventually do a blog post on weval.A few counterpoints that I'd offer (and what led me to still take this approach):- If the target has sub-par debugging infrastructure, it can be easier to debug an interpreter (which is portable) then apply the semantics-preserving PE. In particular when targeting Wasm outside the browser, there is... not really a good debug experience, anywhere, for that. It was way easier to get an interpreter right by developing on native with gdb/rr/whatever, and then separately ensure weval preserves semantics (which I tested with lockstep differential execution).- Maintenance: if one is going to have an interpreter and a compiler anyway (and one often wants this or needs this e.g. to handle eval()), easier for them both to come from the same source.- Amortized cost: in the Wasm world we want AOT compilers for many languages eventually; there are interpreter ports with no Wasm backends; developing weval was a one-time cost and we can eventually apply it multiple times.- If the semantics of the existing interpreter are quite nontrivial, that can push the balance the other way.  I designed weval as part of my work on SpiderMonkey; extremely nontrivial interpreter with all sorts of edge cases; replicating that in a from-scratch compiler seemed a far harder path. (It's since been done by someone else and you can find the \"wasm32 codegen\" patchset in Bugzilla but there are other phasing issues with it from our use-case's PoV; it's not true AOT, it requires codegen at runtime.)I don't think the tradeoff is always clear and if one is building a language from scratch, and targeting a simple ISA, by all means write a direct compiler! But other interesting use-cases do exist.",
      "The divergent semantics risk between the interpreter and the compiler is a really big deal. It's genuinely difficult to get a language implementation to behave exactly as specified, even when the spec is do the same as some other implementation. Treating \"compiled code\" as specialising the interpreter with respect to the program is a great solution to that, since the bugs in the optimiser/partial-evaluator (they're kind of the same thing) are unlikely to be of the same class as bugs from independent implementations.Wasm is a really solid target for heroic compiler optimisations. It's relatively precisely specified, user facing semantic diagnostics are in some language front end out of sight, aliasing is limited and syscalls are finite with known semantics. Pretty much because it was designed by compiler people. You've picked a good target for this technique.",
      "> The gotcha I didn't spot at the time is that a compiler is (I think, could be argued either way) easier to write than a partial evaluator.I agree that this is sometimes true, but there are several, IMHO bigger, issues:1. The partial evaluation of the interpreter might degenerate back to getting a copy of the interpreter loop (or multiple!) and not achieve any speedup, just memory overhead2. The partial evaluator might need additional annotations on what is and is not mutable; it might need a lot of help in order to constant-fold away a key piece of data. Tuning that and getting wrong and result in #1.3. Partially evaluating the interpreter is a pretty slow compiler. You need to do the second Futamura projection (apply the partial evaluator to an interpreter loop without the user code) in order to get a fast compiler. That means the partial evaluator needs to be in the same IR as the partial evaluator's input language.That said, I've chatted a bit with Chris offline about this, and I think this work is really cool and promising. I might tinker with this a little in Wizard too.",
      "That is better expressed than my rambling! The futamura projection is satisfied by passing the \"program\" directly to the interpreter without optimising either, which is sometimes useful as a packaging exercise and does look somewhat like a non-optimising compiler.If you want this trickery to make a useful compiler, the partial evaluator picks up global value numbering, dead code elimination, loop transforms - the effective partial evaluator is very much the optimisation passes of a compiler. It can still be a win if someone else wrote said partial evaluator.Point 2 is the usual \"my compiler is not sufficiently smart, I must annotate the program\" problem, with the slight twist that you're annotating the interpreter in the hope that it does useful things with the end program. Interacts with hoping someone else built the dependency well.And yeah, generated compilers in this fashion have a reputation for being slow, and for not being great optimising compilers, where self application might dig oneself out of the hole. Very like adding optimisations to your compiler to make your compiler faster when building your compiler.All in all the compiler for free tagline (not specifically this post, it's written on a lot of futamura references) feels a bit like an inside joke. It reminds me of the sad discovery that a metacircular interpreter can't interpret itself after all since what you've written is a heavily obfuscated infinite loop.",
      "weval author here (thanks Max for the blog post!). Also AMA!The talk about weval that Max mentions was at NEU and also CMU; the latter was recorded and is here: https://vimeo.com/940568191I also plan to write up a blog post on weval in depth, plus its application to SpiderMonkey-on-Wasm, in a few months; it's pretty exciting though, currently getting 4-5x speedups on some benchmarks on a decidedly nontrivial interpreter!",
      "If the wasi+weval version is better than the compiled one, doesn't it mean that the compiler made a bad job at optimizing out the constant parts?To be fair, in order for weval to do its magic, the code has to be changed and annotated. I'm wondering if a similar set of annotations could convince clang to generate a binary that runs in less than 40 ms.",
      "Clang doesn't know about the static code, so it can't do the optimizations this does.You could probably do the same thing with some hacky C++ code gen and templates, but I'm not sure clang et al would be able to optimize them.",
