At some point I think I started suffering from 'cosmic horror'. In later years I would pay attention only to the moon, and that reduced my stress significantly.Nowadays (like in this bit of news, with photos) when I stick to the small photo in an article, I feel ok.

Because I don\u2019t have a microscope or anything to visually inspect my soldering and these components were mostly just handling power anyway I just checked for shorts between power and ground and tried to take close-ups using my phone to see if I could spot any shorts. The technique that ended up working well for me to solder on these DFN packages without a stencil is to put what can only be described as way too much solder paste on the pads and then pushing the IC in the pool of solder, when the solder melts from the heat of my hot air station the IC will float on top and then I push down on it with tweezers and all excess solder will squeeze out and bead up, hopefully landing somewhere on the solder mask, where I can pick it up later once it\u2019s solid.This is positively an insane methodology for soldering. Fun, but insane.I actually can imagine that it works, strangely enough. But I don't think you'd get much consistent reliability with this. More like it'd work often enough that its good for one-off projects.",

We all know that these parts are getting extremely small and harder to work with, but its still clearly possible to make devices.But yeah, QFNs, if this wettable-flank trend continues, could be quite reliably soldered and inspected from the sides soon. The needs of the high-reliability automotive industry to create an inspection methodology outside of X-Rays is driving this change.",
      "This is an awesome solution.I have the 5-bay variant of the same NAS. I decided to put TrueNAS Scale on it using a Samsung USB stick using the internal USB. I chose one that\u2019s widely used for Tesla dashcam, so I know it is at least somewhat durable.I\u2019m happy with it so far. I still find the CPU performance very lacking so I\u2019m planning on upgrading to something beefier.",

We built a simple open-source CLI tool that recommends a cost-optimal workload based on actual usage data from observability tools. Check it out at https://github.com/kaytu-io/kaytu   \nCurrently, we support AWS EC2 On-Demand Servers & EBS Storage using observability data from CloudWatch to determine utilization. You can optimize EC2 Servers based on CPU, Network, Memory, and Storage. We're expanding support to include OS License, GPU metrics, RDS, and Prometheus integration, and we plan to add more AWS services like EKS and OpenSearch, as well as Azure.\nThis is more than just a utility\u2014we want to provide a no-nonsense platform that makes it ridiculously easy for engineers to build cost-effective apps on the cloud by optimizing workload configurations and customizing to scenarios.\nOpen Core: Inspired by Sid Sijbrandij and GitLab, we've open-sourced our CLI and are actively working on the server side. Our tooling will always remain straightforward and support open-source tools for free.\nWe made it as simple as possible to try out - it\u2019s one command, no sign-up needed, no SaaS platform to share your credentials.\nWe would love you to try it out and give us your feedback!

      "This seems like its overloading the term knowledge graph from its origins. Rather than having information and facts encoded into the graph, this appears to be a sort of similarity search over complete responses. It's blog style \"related content\" links to documents rather than encoded facts.Searching through their sources, it looks like the problem came from Neo4j's blog post misclassifying \"knowledge augmentation\" from a Microsoft research paper with \"knowledge graph\" (because of course they had to add \"graph\" to the title).This approach is fine, and probably useful but its not a knowledge graph in the sense that its structure isn't encoding anything about why or how different entities are actually related. A concrete example in a knowledge graph you might have an entity \"Joe\" and a separate entity \"Paris\". Joe is currently located in Paris so would have a typed edge between the two entities of something like \"LocatedAt\".I didn't dive into the code but what I inferred from the description and referenced literature, it is instead storing complete responses as \"entities\" and simply doing RAG style similarity searches to other nodes. It's a graph structured search index for sure but not a knowledge graph by the standard definitions.",
      "Exactly. Glad to see this. I do think knowledge graphs are important to AI assistants and agents though and someone needs to build a knowledge graph solution for that space.The idea of actual entities and relationships defined like triples with some schema and appropriately resolved and linked can be useful for querying and building up the right context. It may even be time to start bringing back some ideas from the schema.org back the day to standardize across agents/assistants what entities and actions are represented in data fed to them.",
      "Yeah precisely. Knowledge graphs are simple to think about but as soon as you look into them you realize all the complexity is in the creation of a meaningful ontology and loading data into that ontology. I actually think LLMs can be massively useful for building up the ontology but probably not in the creation of the ontology itself (far too ambiguous and large/conceptual task for them right now).",
      "How do we build ontology using LLMs? Will the building blocks be like the different parts of a brain?\nP.S I am assuming that by \"creation of ontology itself\" means creation of AGI.",
      "Ontologies are just defining what certain category, words, and entity types mean. Commonly used in NLP for data representation (\u201cfacts\u201d/triples/etc.) in knowledge graphs and other places where the definition of an ontology helps provide structure.This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with AGI or brains. They are typically created or tuned by humans and then models fit/match/resolve entities to match the ontology.",
      "Yeah, one of the specific things I'd love to do is collaboratively bulking up WikiData more. It's missing a ton of low hanging fruit that people using an ML augmented tool could really make some good progress on, similar to ML assisted OpenStreetMapping work",
      "While I'm 100% on board with RAG using associative memory, I'm not sure you need Neo4J.  Associative recall is generally going to be one level deep, and you're doing a top K cut so even if it wasn't the second order associations are probably not going to make the relevance cut.  This could be done relationally, and then if you're using pg_vector you could retrieve all your rag contents in one query.",
      "I think there's a lot of cases where you don't want to just RAG it. If you're going for tool assisted, it's pretty neat to have agent write out queries for what it needs against the knowledge graph. There was an article recently about how LLMs are bad at inferring B is A from A is B. You can also do more precise math against it, which is useful for questions even people need to reason out.I need to dig into what they're doing here more with their approach, but I think using an LLM for both producing and consuming a knowledge graph is pretty nifty, which I wrote up about a year ago here, https://friend.computer/jekyll/update/2023/04/30/wikidata-ll... .I will say figuring out how to actually add that conversation properly into a large knowledge graph is a bit tricky. ML does seem slightly better at producing an ontology than humans though (look how many times we've had to revise scientific names for creatures or book ordering)",
      "Yes, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be an actual knowledge graph which is part of the issue imho. If you look at the Microsoft knowledge graph paper linked in the repo it looks like they build out a real entity-relationship based knowledge graph rather then storing responses and surface form text directly.",

It was getting much more interesting by the end of the first season.And every season got better and richer. By the very end, I experienced it as actually deep, especially in the way the Keri Russell character unexpectedly evolves. It was a real pleasure and I'm very glad I had the chance to enjoy it.

This at least seems like an upgrade from that.I can imagine the same thing with laws. Preload a city's, county's etc. entire set of laws and for a sentencing, upload a defendant's criminal history report, plea, and other info then the DA/judge/whoever can ask questions to the AI legal advisor just like the doctor does with patient docs.I mention this because RAG is perfect for these kinds of use cases, where you really can't afford the hallucination - where you need its information to be based on specific cases - specific information.I used to think AI would replace doctors before nurses, and lawyers before court clerks - now I think it's the other way around.

      "> It reminded me of a time I was at the ER for a rib injury and could see my doctor Wikipedia'ing stuffTo be honest, I'm much more comfortable with a doctor looking things up on wikipedia than using LLMs. Same with lawyers, although the stakes are lower with lawyers.If I knew my doctor was relying on LLMs for anything beyond the trivial (RAGS or not), I'd lose a lot of trust in that doctor.",
      "Automation bias plus the LLM failure mode (compitant, confident, and inevitable wrong) will absolutely cost lives.I am a fan of ML, but simplicity bias and the fact that hallucinations are an intrinsic feature of LLMs is problematic.ML is absolutely appropriate and will be useful for finding new models in medicine, but it is dangerous and negligent to blindly use, even quantification is often not analytically sufficient in this area.",
      "That's fair, and although I disagree, I at least like that the debate has evolved from doctors vs LLMs to Wikipedia vs LLMs.When we accept that AI is not replacing knowledge workers, the conversation changes to a more digestible and debatable one: Are LLMs useful tools for experts? And I think the answer will be a resounding: Duh",
      ">> Same with lawyers, although the stakes are lower with lawyers.Doctors and lawyer appear to be using LLMs in fundamentally different ways.  Doctors appear to use them as consultants.  The LLM spits out an opinion and the Doctor decides whether to go with it or not.  Doctors are still writing the drug prescriptions.  Lawyers seem to be submitting LLM-generated text to courts without even editing it, which is like the Doctor handing the prescription pad to the robot.",
      "That\u2019s just the highly publicized failures of lawyers. There\u2019s likely lawyers also using them discerningly and doctors using them unscrupulously, but just not as publicized.If a doctor wrote the exact prescription an LLM outputs, how would anyone other than the LLM provider know?",
      "I\u2019m less concerned about how trained professionals use LLMs than I am about untrained folks using them to be a DIY doctor/lawyer.Luckily doctoring has the safeguard that you will need a professional to get drugs/treatments, but there isn't as much of a safety net for lawyering",
      ">> safety net for lawyeringThere are some nets, but they aren't as official.  The lawyer version of a Doctor's prescription pad is the ability to send threatening letters on law firm letterhead.  Lawyers are also afforded privilege's in jails and prisons, things like non-monitored phone calls, that aren't made available to non-lawyers.",
      "but there's no safety net for things that are outside the justice system (e.g., \"is this a fair contract?\") or things the aren't in the justice system yet (e.g., \"am i allowed to cut down my neighbor's tree if it blocks my view?\")",
      "> It reminded me of a time I was at the ER for a rib injury and could see my doctor Wikipedia'ing stuffWhen was this and what country was it in?>  The doctor, the lawyer - like the software engineer - will simply be more powerful than everI love that LLMs exist and this is what people see this as the \"low hanging fruit.\"  You'd expect that if these models had any real value,  they would be used in any other walk of life first,  the fact that they're targeted towards these professions,  to me,  highlights the fact that they are not currently useful and the owners are hoping to recoup their investments by shoving them into the highest value locations.Anyways..  if my Doctor is using an LLM,  then I don't need them anymore,  and the concept of a hospital is now meaningless.  The notion that there would be a middle ground here adds additional insight to the potential future applications of this technology.Where did all the skepticism go?  It's all wanna be marketing here now."

    "summary": "In a world where Googling symptoms before going to the ER is considered peak millennial efficiency, hugodutka.com introduces us to the ground-breaking idea that maybe, just maybe, doctors and lawyers should let computer programs make their tough decisions instead. Commenters, always a beacon of well-measured response, oscillate between terrifying visions of a future where your surgeon consults a chatbot before cutting open, and utopian fantasies where legal advice is as easy and reliable as a WebMD diagnosis. One brave soul reminisces about the simpler times when doctors used Wikipedia, presumably when AI was just a glint in Skynet's eye, while others debate whether it's better to be inaccurately diagnosed by a human or a machine with the warmth of a Speak & Spell. Meanwhile, the legal profession ponders whether swapping the gavel for a keyboard is the upgrade they never knew they needed, or just another way to automate themselves into obsolescence. The consensus? AI might not replace your doctor or lawyer, but it could make them dangerously overconfident or gloriously efficient - as long as it doesn't suggest leeches for your headache based on a misread tweet."

      "The role of brain health in mental illness is commonly discounted, but so consistently found in studies. I got roasted here for recommending psychiatrist Mary Edes' book on improving mental health with dietary changes, but the benefits of the approach are clear.https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/01/27/1227062...I've resolved most of my diabetes type 2 with diet, and nobody should be surprised that this came with improved mental clarity and emotional stability.",
      "This!  Absolutely.  It's as if people think the brain isn't even an organ in the body and that it's completely disconnected from the rest of the body.  After doing a ton of research and listening to many talks on metabolic syndrome and all the diseases caused by our modern diets, I've realized just how impactful diet can be on the body, the brain and the many modern diseases caused by our modern diets and lifestyle.",

      "Not doubting the importance of physical activity, but poor mental health makes it significantly harder to maintain fitness as a child.Often, school sports have minimum GPA requirements. A poor home life increases chances of mental illness and decreases chances that someone will drive you to practice. Will you even maintain the team sport if your teammates never accept you, given whatever mental condition that gives you anxiety or quirks? When can you even consider being active when much of the rest of your life is in shambles? You\u2019re also less likely to have the ability to pay for it, given the correlations between low household income and poor mental health.Poor mental health just makes everything harder to do, and you see that impact every aspect of life in aggregate.The paper isn\u2019t public so \u201ccontrolling for confounders\u201d is all you get, but I doubt they went through all the effort to have deep, revealing conversations about the home life or other nuanced cofounders of each participant.",
      "For those of you with better understanding, did they establish causality? Does exercise fend of mental disorders, or do people with mental disorders find it harder to exercise consistently? The first could be a novel finding, but the latter seems obvious. Forcing yourself to exercise routinely requires discipline, and many mental disorders carry along with them executive dysfunction that make discipline harder to come by.",
      "I can comment on one of your questions. I've been pummeled completely by mental health issues at one point of time in my life and I found it very hard to make any changes in my life, including exercise. The stress made everything worse including making me become rigid in my daily life and keep suffering day in and day out. To make it worse I was only eating out and slurping junk food all the time without realizing what it could do to me.It also broke my ability to see things clearly and think clearly, which made it hard to maintain any discipline that only ruined my health even more. I think this is exactly why a therapist or a coach becomes very important.",
      "Experientally, my brother with ADHD and severe depression, has told me many times, that he notices a huge difference in the severity of his depression based on how much he exercises.",
      "This is a cohort study.  They show association, not causality.",
      "less anxious / depressed kids get to do more sports in the first place.    kids without \"the right attitude\" or a lack of innate ability are routinely excluded from sports, as im sure many of us here have experienced.",
      "Perhaps that can be resolved by getting the children started in sports while they are very young?But you may be right because I have experienced this while watching the other kids in my son's sports classes.My son started going to a gym called \"Kidstrong\" when he was 3.5 years old.  It was basically a bunch of kids following instructions and performing basic calisthenic exercises and beginner gymnastics moves.However, we had to stop going because there was a kid in the class who simply couldn't get his act together.  Maybe he was special needs or maybe that's just the way he was allowed to behave at home.  But the coaches spent so much time trying to get that one kid to follow basic instructions that it ended up detracting from the time that my child and the other kids got with the coaches.  It came to the point where my wife and I (along with a number of other parents) realized that we were paying $25 per 45 minute session for our children to sit and watch the coaches spend 20 minutes trying to corral this one kid who couldn't behave.So we put my son into BJJ instead.  And we're experiencing something very similar.  There are two other kids in his class that simply can't follow instructions or chose not too.  Fortunately this is a locally owned gym so we spoke to the owner about our concerns and he spoke to the kids' parents.  The kids have been behaving better lately, but they still serve as a huge distraction."

It's so damn cool and will likely end up selling for a lot less than its worth due to its size.I've always been fascinated by the supercomputer space, in no small part because I've been sadly somewhat removed from it; the SGI and Cray machines are a bit before my time, but I've always looked back in wonder, thinking of how cool they might have been to play with back in the 80s and 90s.The closest I get to that now is occasionally getting to spin up some kind of HPC cluster on a cloud provider, which is fun in its own right, but I don't know, there's just something insanely cool about the giant racks of servers whose sole purpose is to crunch numbers [1].[1] To the pendants, I know all computers' job is to crunch numbers in some capacity, but a lot of computers and their respective operating systems like to pretend that they don't.",

      "The individual servers are not watercooled. The compute racks are air-cooled; the adjacent cooling racks then exchange that heat using the building's chilled water. It's the rack as a whole that is watercooled. If you extract a single node, you won't get any of that. As the other commenters also point out, these are blades; you can't run an individual node by itself.",

      "For anyone who read the README and is now thinking that agrind is \"like jq but with aggregations\" \u2014 it's much more than that, and (at least in the tasks I use it for) really more complementary to pipeline transformer tools like jq.Specifically, the \"killer app\" feature for agrind, is that it's a live reporting tool. You can just throw a CSV file through agrind to get a nice one-shot aggregation out. But if you stream a live data source into it \u2014 think something like \"your k8s ingress controller's access logs\" \u2014 then agrind will grab your TTY; draw a table to fills it; and begin live-updating that table with the report, with the rows re-ordering to stay sorted as more data is received.Want to see e.g. the top 10 highest-duration HTTP requests by path given some particular HTTP status code? You can just start streaming logs into it, and the report will gradually come into focus as it finds matching events. Hit ^C when the data has \"stabilized\" (i.e. when datapoint ranks are no longer jumping around), and you'll be left with the last-refreshed state of the table in your terminal scrollback, to use in further investigations.agrind has jq-like manipulation tools, but honestly, I mostly still use jq for that part. I have no idea how to unwrap JSON list items in agrind (or if that's even possible), but if I want to do that, I'll just:    http localhost:8001/v1/debug/inflight-requests | jq -c '.[].jsonPayload' | agrind '* | json | sum(dur) by path'\n\n---Bonus recommendation, as it's something I use together with jq and agrind: stern (https://github.com/rancher/stern) \u2014 for live tail(1)ing of the O(N) pods of a k8s Deployment, right from the cluster, without any external log multiplexer.    stern ingress-nginx-controller -i some_path_frag -o raw 2>/dev/null | agrind '* | json | where status == 403 | count by client_addr' 2>/dev/null\n\nNote the two instances of `2>/dev/null` here.The first one is to remove the \"connected to pod XYZ\" meta info from stern(1) output, that would muck up the agrind table.The second one, though, is more interesting: it's there because unlike jq, agrind doesn't die when it hits an unparseable line! Instead, it just spits a parse error and continues. So you can have agrind consume a \"dirty\" data stream \u2014 e.g. a combined \"structured JSON access log + plaintext error log\" stream \u2014 and then just discard stderr, to silence the resulting errors printed from the failed attempts at parsing the error-log lines of the stream.",
