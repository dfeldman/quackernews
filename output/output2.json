      "I didn't see any mention of having a spinning surface.A tapered cylinder \"gravity gym\" with adjustable angled walls, and variable speed spinning, could smoothly create much greater \"gravity\".Spin gravity would also enable body weight strength exercises, core exercises, stationary or small area cardio like exercise bikes, VR games, yoga, etc. Even a \"gravity\" environment for sleeping.Much easier to do spinning on the moon, with lots of space and stable ground, vs. in space where volume is precious and accelerations have to be accurately counter balanced. And this could generalize to very low gravity environments like asteroid facilities.",
      "Whenever I see horizontal running I thought of Sir Humphrey and the Christmas special.",
      "Would running prevent deconditioning in muscles that aren't stressed by running?",
      "Running in a circle like this would temporarily give the impression of higher gravity which would affect all muscles.",
      "That makes sense, thanks. So the claim here is that exposure to a force similar to Earth gravity for \"a few laps a day\" would prevent/reduce whole-body deconditioning?I guess that makes sense too, since a few reps of weightlifting every couple days is enough to trigger muscle growth and bone densification.",

      "The \"Merkle tree\" algorithm here isn't using a Merkle tree, it's just a binary partitioning algorithm. The point of a Merkle tree is that it's a tree of hashes. Also, it doesn't really solve the consistency problem the author claims is the biggest problem; yes, over time it will correct for Elasticsearch's eventual consistency, but in the short run it's just as bad as pagination.I don't know the author's application, but I question the desire to get a consistent dump from Elasticsearch in the first place. It is very not much intended to be a \"source of truth\", so you're better off streaming the data from your original data source, which is presumably something like an SQL database.That said, if you want a stable snapshot of an entire index \u2014 where your requirement is to not ever miss documents due to concurrent updates \u2014 then you can use Elasticsearch's snapshot support. Each snapshot is just that, a read-only snapshot of the data, allowing consistent reads.The eventual consistency problem that the article describes is solved by refreshing the index. You can use \"refresh=wait_for\" when doing an update in order to wait for Elasticsearch to make the update searchable. You can also force a refresh. Any subsequent query will return the newest indexed data.Since 6.x, Elasticsearch has had docvalue pagination via \"search_after\", which allows pagination without a durable cursor. Each cursor value is the docvalue set of the last seen document. This is consistent insofar as the set of source documents is consistent (so it's not safe against concurrent updates). There's essentially little need to use \"_scroll\" or offset-based pagination anymore.",
      "I think the author was using the search_after strategy (or something roughly equivalent). They were using \u2018cursor\u2019 in the generic sense as a place in the list of documents, rather than the specific durable cursors api offered by elasticsearch",
      "ok, I obviously don't know all the issues this team is dealing with, but it seems to be the goal of what they were doing was this...take the base data in one ES instance and split it out into several ES instances.The way do do that is to go back to the data of record and repopulate the different ES instances (or new datastore).

      "This is quite an interesting solution. Especially with DFS approach in mind. Thank you!",
      "This is a generic problem across a vast range of technologies: how to handle scale out replication with delays and have a consistent \u201cstreaming\u201d experience.The main issue is that most query languages like SQL predate HTTP and haven\u2019t been updated with the same concepts such as ETag headers and cookies.Every database request should include a transaction consistency header that contains a vector clock of logical replication status. Every response should include cache control headers and an updated vector clock. This should then be encrypted and bubbled up through the HTTP pipeline to the end clients.E.g.: a client should able to request a \u201csnapshot no older then T minutes\u201d for a report run and be able to return a cookie that ensures that subsequent queries remain consistent with that. Most databases can do this\u2026 for a single TCP socket connection only. They\u2019ll lose track of the context if the socket is closed or if multiple servers connect from a web farm.With an approach like this, any cache or any replica could be utilised for any query in a safe and consistent manner.Essentially, this would be fixing an impedance mismatch between a stateful connection-oriented system and a stateless request-response system.",
      "nice very cleannever thought of bubbling up the DB Transaction ID up to  the cookie layer",
      "Interesting.I've always opted for cursor pagination for client consumer APIs.For anything \"admin\" or management type stuff, it runs into the same issues you mentioned. In that case, I'd used application level queues and it took a long time for things like exports and what not."

They seek to educate man, asking in return only air and energy to supplement the diminished supplies in their own, older world.The story revolves around a group of German scientists who, when seeking the North Pole, come upon a Martian settlement there..A young German reader of \"Two Planets\", Wernher von Braun, would develop ballistic missiles for Germany/USA, rockets that launched the first US space satellite and the NASA launch vehicle that took Apollo to the Moon.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_(scientists)> Leo Szilard, who jokingly suggested that Hungary was a front for aliens from Mars, used this term. In an answer to the question of why there is no evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth (called the Fermi paradox) despite the high probability of it existing, Szil\u00e1rd responded: \"They are already here among us \u2013 they just call themselves Hungarians.\"The group included Erdos and von Neumann.",
      "Wernher von Braun himself also wrote probably the first serious treatise on human missions to mars as well as a science fiction novel on the topic in 1948. Apparently the original German novel remains unpublished, but there is an English translation available. It\u2019s set in 1980.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Projecthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars:_A_Technical_TaleCheck out the second link\u2019s section about \u201cthe Elon\u201d.",

      "Those exist here at the expense of different peoples, depending where you are in Germany. Most popular, from what I can tell, are East Frisians, but that has to do with a comedian who made a lot of those jokes (Otto Waalkes).",
      "Possibly worth also including just how controversial Wernher von Braun is.Von Braun is a highly controversial figure widely seen as escaping justice for his Nazi war crimes due to the Americans' desire to beat the Soviets in the Cold Warhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun",
      "What does that have to do with the comment you're replying to?Edit: This is an honest question, I'm not familiar with the extent of his crimes, if any. It certainly doesn't seem like a clear-cut \"he was an objectively evil man but we looked the other way\" based on the Wikipedia article.

      "I quickly skimmed the paper, got inspired to simplify it, and created some Pytorch Layer :https://github.com/GistNoesis/FourierKAN/The core is really just a few lines.In the paper they use some spline interpolation to represent 1d function that they sum. Their code seemed aimed at smaller sizes. Instead I chose a different representation, aka fourier coefficients that are used to interpolate the functions of individual coordinates.It should give an idea of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks representation power, it should probably converge easier than their spline version but spline version have less operations.Of course, if my code doesn't work, it doesn't mean theirs doesn't.Feel free to experiment and publish paper if you want.",
      "How GPU-friendly is this class of models?",
      "you really are a pragmatic programmer, Noesis",
      "Thanks. I like simple things.Sums and products can get you surprisingly far.Conceptually it's simpler to think about and optimize. But you can also write it use einsum to do the sum product reductions (I've updated some comment to show how) to use less memory, but it's more intimidating.You can probably use KeOps library to fuse it further (einsum would get in the way).But the best is probably a custom kernel. Once you have written it as sums and product, it's just iterating. Like the core is 5 lines, but you have to add roughly 500 lines of low-level wrapping code to do cuda parallelisation, c++ to python, various types, manual derivatives. And then you have to add various checks so that there are no buffer overflows. And then you can optimize for special hardware operations like tensor cores. Making sure along the way that no numerical errors where introduced.So there are a lot more efforts involved, and it's usually only worth it if the layer is promising, but hopefully AI should be able to autocomplete these soon.",
      "I've spent some time playing with their Jupyter notebooks. The most useful (to me, anyway) is their Example_3_classfication.ipynb ([1]).It works as advertised with the parameters selected by the authors, but if we modified the network shape in the second half of the tutorial (Classification formulation) from (2, 2) to (2, 2, 2), it fails to generalize. The training loss gets down to 1e-9, while test loss stays around 3e-1. Getting to larger network sizes does not help either.I would really like to see a bigger example with many more parameters and more data complexity and if it could be trained at all. MNIST would be a good start.Update: I increased the training dataset size 100x, and that helps with the overfitting, but now I can't get training loss below 1e-2. Still iterating on it; a GPU acceleration would really help - right now, my progress is limited by the speed of my CPU.1. https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan/blob/master/tutorials/...",
      "Update2: got it to 100% training accuracy, 99% test accuracy with (2, 2, 2) shape.Changes:1. Increased the training set from 1000 to 100k samples. This solved overfitting.2. In the dataset generation, slightly reduced noise (0.1 -> 0.07) so that classes don't overlap. With an overlap, naturally, it's impossible to hit 100%.3. Most important & specific to KANs: train for 30 steps with grid=5 (5 segments for each activation function), then 30 steps with grid=10 (and initializing from the previous model), and then 30 steps with grid=20. This is idiomatic to KANs and covered in the Example_1_function_fitting.ipynb: https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan/blob/master/tutorials/...Overall, my impressions are:- it works!- the reference implementation is very slow. A GPU implementation is dearly needed.- it feels like it's a bit too non-linear and training is not as stable as it's with MLP + ReLU.- Scaling is not guaranteed to work well. Really need to see if MNIST is possible to solve with this approach.I will definitely keep an eye on this development.",
      "This makes me wonder what you could achieve if instead of iteratively growing the grid, or worrying about pruning or regularization, you governed network topology with some sort of evolutionary algorithm.",
      "You can do much better by growing an AST with memoization and non-linear regression. So much so, the EVO folks gave a best paper to a non-EVO, deterministic algorithm at their conferencehttps://seminars.math.binghamton.edu/ComboSem/worm-chiu.pge_... (author)",
      "Believe there is a Google paper out there that tried that",
      "1000s, there is a whole field and set of conferences. You can find more by searching \"Genetic Programming\" or \"Symbolic Regression\"KAN, with the library of variables and math operators, very much resembles this family of algos, problems, and limitations. The lowest hanging fruit they usually leave on the proverbial tree is that you can use fast regression techniques for the constants and coefficients. No need to leave it up to random perturbations or gradient descent. What you really need to figure out is the form or shape of the model, rather than leaving it up to the human (in KAN)"

I believe we were the first to do \"responsive\" web notation (that part of the site launched in 2014).Here's a tech talk I gave with a lot of details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH5EtQge_BgHere's an example of responsive Soundslice notation: https://www.soundslice.com/slices/zzNlc/ (in the settings, set the stave width to maximum to get \"Fit to screen\" for the true responsive effect)We've got a whole suite of tools built around this, including an excellent web-based editor, rich practice functionality and a relatively new scanning feature (extracting the musical data from a photo or PDF).I agree with other commenters here that this CSS Grid approach could be handy for lightweight projects but it likely isn't up to snuff for the incredibly subtle and complex world of full scores. With that said, I just want to stress again that this is super cool and I'm glad it exists!",
      "Oh wow, small world! I use soundslice nearly everyday as an end user of a few music education sites!!!",
      "Could you perhaps elaborate about what makes it 'not up to snuff', given how much you used it as a chance to promote your own stuff?",
      "Maybe the segment on engraving of Tantacruls Musescore 4 video is a good explanation of some of the things involved:https://youtu.be/Qct6LKbneKQ?t=2005the whole video is worth watching as well (and there are several videos on the channel focusing on the UI of notation apps, worth watching for anyone who does UI but isn't interested in music production as well)",
      "Take a look at the visual tests for VexFlow to get an idea of the complexity music engraving can have: https://www.vexflow.com/tests/",
      "Perhaps you noticed that the beams aren't really attached to the notes they are supposed to be beaming together.OP doesn't show any multi-stave (i.e. \"full score\") example at all -- if the system could do that, it would likely have been part of the demo.This is extremely cool technology, but it's clear that more polish would be needed before it's ready for general use.",
      "Such unnecessary aggression towards someone who built something cool and useful.",
      "It was constructive criticism from someone with expertise",
      "It was neither.",
      "This is extraordinary. While JavaScript is needed now, I\u2019d encourage the author to see what needs to be added to CSS to allow a CSS-only solution, and promote it in the CSS community. For example, repeating the clef when wrapping is akin to a sticky table header, and would have more applications than only music.Some CSS notation is wholly new to me:> .stave > [data-pitch^=\"A\"][data-pitch$=\"5\"] { grid-row-start: A5; }I\u2019ve never seen CSS selectors with square brackets before.

      "A resonable icon format would be a vector file plus (at least optionally) 16 and 32px bitmap images. A 16x16 px icon is still common (eg toolbar buttons at desktop resolutions lower than 4K) and as evident by the article there is no way of rasterizing a vector image to 16x16 and preserving anything but a blurry mess. At least not without using a very clever (AI could possibly do it) rasterizer.The 16x16 representation is often completely different from the vector or 64x64 version. If you draw a clock, the large version is 3D has numbers and 3 hands. The smaller versions is 2D, has 2 hands and no digits.",
      "Many of us look at https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg at 16x16 every day, and wouldn't call it a blurry mess.",

      "24x24 and below still require special treatment because pixel grid alignment becomes really important. The tape recorder image demonstrates this well: the raster 16x16 looks way better than the vector. I wonder if it would generally be better to store these tiny sizes as bitmaps in the container.",
      "Yeah, I'm suprised the original article didn't mention that. One of the main reasons that smaller icons are stored as separate files is that they need to actually be designed differently, not just scaled down.",

      "> If you use the standard bitmap icon formats, you\u2019ll probably store them in their own files, separate from the files that use them. In order to display each file in a folder, the operating system will need to read the metadata for the file (including its name and file type) and then read the icon file for that file type. If the icon file were so small that you could store it in the same place as the file metadata, then you could save a read from the hard drive \u2013 you could get the metadata and the icon all in one read.> ... it could be a significant performance gain to halve the number of disk reads even if rendering a vector image takes longer than rendering a bitmap.Surely another option would be to cache all the filetype icons in memory and thereby only read them once? You could still use this cool vector format and get the best of both worlds, so each icon would be small and would be read only once, and you wouldn't have duplicate icon data all over the disk. And then if you wanted to change the icon associated with a particular filetype, you wouldn't need to update every single inode for files of that type."

    "first_paragraph": "Haiku uses a custom vector image format to store icons. This is surprising both because most OSes consider bitmaps to be totally sufficient to represent icons and because there are plenty of vector graphics formats out this (e.g. SVG).

This allows Haiku to display icons as several sizes while still keeping the files small enough to fit into an inode (i.e., inside a file\u2019s metadata). The goal of keeping the icons in the metadata is to reduce the disk reads needed to display a folder \u2013 it allows each file to only require one disk read to display.",

      "Andrew, you and your friends should be proud. It's really encouraging to see people, especially in your generation, thinking seriously about the problem of misinformation. There are fundamental challenges you all will face in this idea:- most current LLMs are trained on large amounts of web data that itself contains facts, opinions, and misinformation. These things are treated equally, so I would expect the LLM to get common facts right, but also to represent opinions or misinformation as facts when they are pervasive.- LLMs \"hallucinate\" and tend not to know when to say \"I don't know\" or to not try to fact-check something that is not factual in nature....in short, I would expect LLMs to be an unreliable fact checker, which has the potential to do as much harm as good.",

      "Thank you!",
      "Thinking out loud... I don't think these problems can be solved. If you are going to do it anyway, I would suggest:- Using a RAG architecture on top of a database of factual information. Wikipedia is probably your best bet. It is not 100% factual or correct either, but maybe as good as it gets. Scaling RAG to wikipedia size is not trivial, but I think it can be done.- Prompting the LLM to cite its sources so people can fact-check the fact-checker- Prompting the LLM to say it is unsure when something does not have a clear answer. I don't expect this to be reliable, but maybe somewhat better",
      "There's a whole art to prompting a LLM to say it's unsure.  I need to write a blog post about this, it's deep.",
      "Sample a bunch of LLMs with the same question, if they disagree much then they are unsure. You can even sample the same LLM with high enough temperature, text augmentations, different prompts or different demonstrations. When they are correct they say the same thing, but when they make mistakes, they make different ones. This only works for factual or reasoning tasks, but that's where it matters.",
      "But how do you know if the LLMs agree, when all of them word the response differentlyFor exampleLLM 1: Yes, it is true that fireworks were invented in ChinaLLM 2: Fireworks were indeed invented in China",
      "This is trivially achievable with function calling, assuming the model you use supports this (which most models do at this point).Define a function `reportFactual(isFactual: boolean)` and you will get standardized, machine-readable answers to do statistics with."

Our budding Zuckerberg is already swamped with *adoring* commentators applauding the sheer bravery of mixing naive ambition with notorious LLM inaccuracies.

Meanwhile, suggestions to use Wikipedia as a factual pillar almost redeem the whole effort, giving a comical undertow to the idea that anyone, anywhere, believes this venture is steering toward anything but a delightful disaster in AI ethics. At least the future of entertainment seems bright."
