      "I love that there are multiple sensors that can be compared to like this, but also love when the optical images from Hubble are compared as well.The images that combine all of the frequencies from Chandra X-rays, Hubble's optical, and now Webb's IR make for some truly fascinating images.",

Not stars.  Galaxies.The nebula is about 1375 light years away.  Those galaxies in the distance.... are billions of light years away.  It's hard to comprehend.",
      "> look behind it, and there are whole edge-on spiral galaxies in the distance. Not stars. Galaxies.just to add to the awe of that, pretty much every \"dot\" in one of these images is going to be another galaxy. individual stars from within the Milky Way will have diffraction spikes and very obvious as a single item.",
      "There really is a lot of stuff left to see for the first time",
      "\"A lot\" is the number of fish in a swarm maybe.This is so far away from our concept of counting things that the mind just gives up. There's no comparison, no dumbing down to X amount of football fields, just nothing.I find it depressing, confusing but also inspiring and fascinating at the same time.",
      "Yes, there is so much we can\u2019t possibly know or experience in our lifetimes, perhaps in the span of time our species will exist, to the extent that it becomes easy to imagine ourselves more like bacteria on a speck of dust floating in the air rather than on any scale towards the inverse. We\u2019re incredibly small in size and mental capacity.In ways the bacteria on the dust are oblivious to the scale and nature of the world around them, we seem similarly lost and hopeless in the pursuit of comprehending the universe. We just weren\u2019t built to grasp this kind of scale. We can enjoy images of the tiniest little slices of it, though. I\u2019m actually very grateful for that. I think it\u2019ll be a source of endless wonder for my entire life.",
      "That's an incredibly detailed image.Every single time I see one of these amazing space pics, it's hard not to get all philisophical and wonder about the size of space & time on cosmic scale, how small our earth is and how insignificant our regular problems are.I don't care if I don't get to see flying cars or AGI in my lifetime but I will be very  disappointed if our knowledge of space remains more or less the same as today without much progress.",

As armchair astronomers gush over the photos' clarity and engage in a pixel-peeping showdown between NIRCam and MIRI images, the real spectacle unfolds in their eagerness to philosophize about our cosmic insignificance. \"Look behind the nebula; there are galaxies!\" one points out, as if galaxies behind other celestial objects is a novel concept rather than a basic expectation of space. Meanwhile, another commenter adjusts their monocle to the finer points of diffraction spikes on distant stars, signaling we've reached the peak of internet-enabled space snobbery. The only thing more vast than the universe, it seems, is the human capacity for stating the obvious with a sense of groundbreaking discovery. At least one user, faced with the majesty of ultra HD space dust, humbly requests a better YouTube resolution to ponder our existential dread in 2160p instead of 432p \u2013 because if we're going to feel insignificant, we might as well do so in 4K."

Amidst the fervor, a commenter, in a moment of pure originality, exclaims their intention to post about it, only to find themselves outpaced by someone with a quicker copy-paste reflex. The linked tweet, predictably, serves as conclusive evidence of the paradigm-shifting capabilities of the new GPT iteration, because, as we all know, Twitter is where the most rigorous of peer reviews occur. Society, brace yourselves for AI-generated comments so indistinguishable from human banality, future discussions will be a mesmerizing blend of existential dread and the peculiar comfort of not knowing if you're arguing with a human or a bot."

      "This seems like its overloading the term knowledge graph from its origins. Rather than having information and facts encoded into the graph, this appears to be a sort of similarity search over complete responses. It's blog style \"related content\" links to documents rather than encoded facts.Searching through their sources, it looks like the problem came from Neo4j's blog post misclassifying \"knowledge augmentation\" from a Microsoft research paper with \"knowledge graph\" (because of course they had to add \"graph\" to the title).This approach is fine, and probably useful but its not a knowledge graph in the sense that its structure isn't encoding anything about why or how different entities are actually related. A concrete example in a knowledge graph you might have an entity \"Joe\" and a separate entity \"Paris\". Joe is currently located in Paris so would have a typed edge between the two entities of something like \"LocatedAt\".I didn't dive into the code but what I inferred from the description and referenced literature, it is instead storing complete responses as \"entities\" and simply doing RAG style similarity searches to other nodes. It's a graph structured search index for sure but not a knowledge graph by the standard definitions.",
      "Exactly. Glad to see this. I do think knowledge graphs are important to AI assistants and agents though and someone needs to build a knowledge graph solution for that space.The idea of actual entities and relationships defined like triples with some schema and appropriately resolved and linked can be useful for querying and building up the right context. It may even be time to start bringing back some ideas from the schema.org back the day to standardize across agents/assistants what entities and actions are represented in data fed to them.",
      "Yeah precisely. Knowledge graphs are simple to think about but as soon as you look into them you realize all the complexity is in the creation of a meaningful ontology and loading data into that ontology. I actually think LLMs can be massively useful for building up the ontology but probably not in the creation of the ontology itself (far too ambiguous and large/conceptual task for them right now).",
      "How do we build ontology using LLMs? Will the building blocks be like the different parts of a brain?\nP.S I am assuming that by \"creation of ontology itself\" means creation of AGI.",
      "Ontologies are just defining what certain category, words, and entity types mean. Commonly used in NLP for data representation (\u201cfacts\u201d/triples/etc.) in knowledge graphs and other places where the definition of an ontology helps provide structure.This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with AGI or brains. They are typically created or tuned by humans and then models fit/match/resolve entities to match the ontology.",
      "Yeah, one of the specific things I'd love to do is collaboratively bulking up WikiData more. It's missing a ton of low hanging fruit that people using an ML augmented tool could really make some good progress on, similar to ML assisted OpenStreetMapping work",
      "These new systems would do well to have a compelling \u201cwow, this solves a hard problem that can\u2019t be solved in another straightforward way\u201d.The current YouTube video has a query about the Dallas Mavericks and it\u2019s not clear how it\u2019s using any of its memory or special machinery to answer the query: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnUU3_xK6bg",
      "While I'm 100% on board with RAG using associative memory, I'm not sure you need Neo4J.  Associative recall is generally going to be one level deep, and you're doing a top K cut so even if it wasn't the second order associations are probably not going to make the relevance cut.  This could be done relationally, and then if you're using pg_vector you could retrieve all your rag contents in one query.",
      "I think there's a lot of cases where you don't want to just RAG it. If you're going for tool assisted, it's pretty neat to have agent write out queries for what it needs against the knowledge graph. There was an article recently about how LLMs are bad at inferring B is A from A is B. You can also do more precise math against it, which is useful for questions even people need to reason out.I need to dig into what they're doing here more with their approach, but I think using an LLM for both producing and consuming a knowledge graph is pretty nifty, which I wrote up about a year ago here, https://friend.computer/jekyll/update/2023/04/30/wikidata-ll... .I will say figuring out how to actually add that conversation properly into a large knowledge graph is a bit tricky. ML does seem slightly better at producing an ontology than humans though (look how many times we've had to revise scientific names for creatures or book ordering)",
      "Yes, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be an actual knowledge graph which is part of the issue imho. If you look at the Microsoft knowledge graph paper linked in the repo it looks like they build out a real entity-relationship based knowledge graph rather then storing responses and surface form text directly."

One commenter, armed with the lasso of truth (or at least a strong opinion formed after skimming a Neo4j blog post), embarks on a quest to educate the masses about the sacrilege of misusing the sacred term \"knowledge graph,\" only to spiral into a philosophical debate on the nuances of ontology creation that leaves everyone more confused than enlightened. Meanwhile, somewhere in the depths of YouTube, an unrelated video on the Dallas Mavericks becomes an accidental case study for this groundbreaking technology, proving once and for all that the best way to test memory systems is through sports trivia. The consensus?

When I first checked it out, the basic setup seemed rather inane and I stopped watching.Then, a couple years later, I needed something to watch during long exercise sessions and I checked it out again. It was getting much more interesting by the end of the first season.And every season got better and richer. By the very end, I experienced it as actually deep. It was a real pleasure and I'm very glad I had the chance to enjoy it. Recommended!",

Very disappointed by that aspect and I hope they're done with that excess.",
      "That's a fair statement. My standard for this type of show remains BBC's Tinker Tailor Solider Spy (1979) and the follow up Smiley's People (1982).Alec Guinness owns Smiley. Just perfect. Absolutely gripping yet low budget. If you haven't seen those I say whip up ye old torrent client and get some.Anyways, I did say \"too greatly\".

I found their existence believable, if not the high speed Range Rover driving stuff. It's very clearly not going for full-on realism, obviously a fantasy spy show. So the dogs work in that context - at least for me.EDIT: someone else mentioned Tinker Tailor (either the '80s BBC miniseries or the Gary Oldman movie - once again he's killing it) which is far more grounded. That might be more up your street? I enjoyed both a lot. Bleak as hell though.",

      "I saw a RAG demo from a startup that allows you to upload patient's medical docs, then the doctor can ask it questions like:> what's the patient's bp?even questions about drugs, histories, interactions, etc. The AI keeps in mind the patient's age and condition in its responses, when recommending things, etc. It reminded me of a time I was at the ER for a rib injury and could see my doctor Wikipedia'ing stuff - couldn't believe they used so much Wikipedia to get their answers. This at least seems like an upgrade from that.I can imagine the same thing with laws. Preload a city's, county's etc. entire set of laws and for a sentencing, upload a defendant's criminal history report, plea, and other info then the DA/judge/whoever can ask questions to the AI legal advisor just like the doctor does with patient docs.I mention this because RAG is perfect for these kinds of use cases, where you really can't afford the hallucination - where you need its information to be based on specific cases - specific information.I used to think AI would replace doctors before nurses, and lawyers before court clerks - now I think it's the other way around. The doctor, the lawyer - like the software engineer - will simply be more powerful than ever and have lower overhead. The lower-down jobs will get eaten, never the knowledge work.",
      "> It reminded me of a time I was at the ER for a rib injury and could see my doctor Wikipedia'ing stuffTo be honest, I'm much more comfortable with a doctor looking things up on wikipedia than using LLMs. Same with lawyers, although the stakes are lower with lawyers.If I knew my doctor was relying on LLMs for anything beyond the trivial (RAGS or not), I'd lose a lot of trust in that doctor.",
      "Automation bias plus the LLM failure mode (compitant, confident, and inevitable wrong) will absolutely cost lives.I am a fan of ML, but simplicity bias and the fact that hallucinations are an intrinsic feature of LLMs is problematic.ML is absolutely appropriate and will be useful for finding new models in medicine, but it is dangerous and negligent to blindly use, even quantification is often not analytically sufficient in this area.",
      ">> Same with lawyers, although the stakes are lower with lawyers.Doctors and lawyer appear to be using LLMs in fundamentally different ways.  Doctors appear to use them as consultants.  The LLM spits out an opinion and the Doctor decides whether to go with it or not.  Doctors are still writing the drug prescriptions.  Lawyers seem to be submitting LLM-generated text to courts without even editing it, which is like the Doctor handing the prescription pad to the robot.",
      "> Preload a city's, county's etc. entire set of lawsYou would also need to load an enormous amount of precedential case law, at least in the US and other common law jurisdictions. Synthesizing case law into rules of law applicable to a specific case requires complex analysis that is frequently sensitive to details of the factual context, where LLMs' lack of common sense can lead it to make false conclusions, particularly in situations where the available, on-point case law is thin on the ground and as a result directly analogous cases are not available.I don't see the utility at the current performance level of LLMs, though, as the OP article seems to confirm. LLMs may excel in restating or summarizing black letter or well-established law under narrow circumstances, but that's a vanishingly small percentage of the actual work involved in practicing law. Most cases are unremarkable, and the lawyers and judges involved do not need to conduct any research that would require something like consulting an AI assistant to resolve all the important questions. It's just routine, there's nothing special about any given DUI case, for example. Where actual research is required, the question is typically extremely nuanced, and that is precisely where LLMs tend to struggle the most to produce useful outputs. LLMs are also unlikely to identify such issues, because they are issues for which sufficient precedent does not exist and therefore the LLM will by definition have to engage in extrapolational, creative analysis rather than simply reproducing ideas or language from its training set.",
      "Obviously, no idea why your doc was using Wikipedia so much, but in general the fair baseline to compare isn't Wikipedia, it's mature, professionally reviewed material like Uptodate, Dynamed, AMBOSS, etc   that do have clinical decision support tools and purpose built calculators and references. Of course they're all working on GenAI stuff. (Not to mention professional wikis like LIFTL, emcrit, IBCC).An issue with these products is access and expense (wealthy institutions easily have access, poorer ones do not), but that seems like a problem that is no better with the new fangled tech.GIGO is a bigger problem. The current state of tech cannot overcome a shitty history and physical. I surmise that is a bigger factor than the incremental conveniences of RAG, but I could very well be full of crap.",
      "I've 100% found AI to be super helpful in learning a new programming language or refreshing on one I haven't used in a while. Hey how do I this thing in Gleam? What's Gleams equivalent of y? I turn it first instead of forums/stackoverflow/google now and would say I only need to turn to other sources less than maybe 5% of the time.",
      "I think that is right. The sweat spot is twofold: 1) A replacement for general search on a topic where you have limited familiarity that can give you an answer for a concise question, or a starting point for more investigation or 2) For power-user use cases, where there already exists subject matter expertise, elaboration or extrapolation from a clear starting point to a clear end state, such as translation or contextualized exposition.The problem comes with thinking you can bridge both of those use cases - vague task descriptions to final output. The work described in the article of getting an LLM itself to break down a task seems to work sometime but struggles in many scenarios. Products that can define their domain narrowly enough, and embed enough domain knowledge into the system, and can ask the feedback at the right points, and going to be successful and more generalized systems will either need to act more like tools rather than complete solutions.",
      "Absolutely, I can't imagine doing Angular without an LLM sidekick.Curiosity + LLM = instant knowledge",

I actually read documentation more often now because its pretty clear when I'm trying to do something common (LLM handle this well) vs uncommon (LLM often do not handle this well)."

      "For anyone who read the README and is now thinking that agrind is \"like jq but with aggregations\" \u2014 it's much more than that, and (at least in the tasks I use it for) really more complementary to pipeline transformer tools like jq.Specifically, the \"killer app\" feature for agrind, is that it's a live reporting tool. You can just throw a CSV file through agrind to get a nice one-shot aggregation out. But if you stream a live data source into it \u2014 think something like \"your k8s ingress controller's access logs\" \u2014 then agrind will grab your TTY; draw a table to fills it; and begin live-updating that table with the report, with the rows re-ordering to stay sorted as more data is received.Want to see e.g. the top 10 highest-duration HTTP requests by path given some particular HTTP status code? You can just start streaming logs into it, and the report will gradually come into focus as it finds matching events. Hit ^C when the data has \"stabilized\" (i.e. when datapoint ranks are no longer jumping around), and you'll be left with the last-refreshed state of the table in your terminal scrollback, to use in further investigations.agrind has jq-like manipulation tools, but honestly, I mostly still use jq for that part. I have no idea how to unwrap JSON list items in agrind (or if that's even possible), but if I want to do that, I'll just:    http localhost:8001/v1/debug/inflight-requests | jq -c '.[].jsonPayload' | agrind '* | json | sum(dur) by path'\n\n---Bonus recommendation, as it's something I use together with jq and agrind: stern (https://github.com/rancher/stern) \u2014 for live tail(1)ing of the O(N) pods of a k8s Deployment, right from the cluster, without any external log multiplexer.    stern ingress-nginx-controller -i some_path_frag -o raw 2>/dev/null | agrind '* | json | where status == 403 | count by client_addr' 2>/dev/null\n\nNote the two instances of `2>/dev/null` here.The first one is to remove the \"connected to pod XYZ\" meta info from stern(1) output, that would muck up the agrind table.The second one, though, is more interesting: it's there because unlike jq, agrind doesn't die when it hits an unparseable line! Instead, it just spits a parse error and continues. So you can have agrind consume a \"dirty\" data stream \u2014 e.g. a combined \"structured JSON access log + plaintext error log\" stream \u2014 and then just discard stderr, to silence the resulting errors printed from the failed attempts at parsing the error-log lines of the stream.",

    "summary": "In an unsurprising twist of fate, the developer community has once again pinpointed the necessity of slicing and dicing command line logs with the precision of a poorly maintained chainsaw. *Angle-grinder* emerges as the hero no one asked for, accompanied by a chorus of commenters hawking their own pet projects with the subtlety of carnival barkers on their fourth cup of coffee. Amid declarations of undying loyalty to Rust and thinly veiled cries for validation, one finds a kaleidoscope of alternative tools, each claiming to reinvent the wheel with slightly rounder edges. As the comments descend into a technical abyss, filled with the echoes of \"cool tool\" and \"great UX,\" newcomers may be forgiven for mistaking this for innovative dialogue, rather than the usual tech-elitist echo chamber, where the only requirement for entry is an opinion and a GitHub link."

      "Can you think of a way to use your live cloud data as the background shader for https://github.com/sebosp/chartacritty ? I was also hoping to draw the iss progression through the earth, but sometimes people use terminals to actually read  and may become confusing...\nFor the rewind functionality you could look into rerun.io, not sure it's compatible with your current libraries but may be fun",
      "There's a composite image with the clouds and earth at https://clouds.matteason.co.uk/images/8192x4096/earth.jpg that you might be able to use?",
      "Very good looking. It'd be amazing if it has some kind of \"time travelling\" option or an easy way to know the next time the ISS will pass over a certain location.",
      "Thanks! Yeah rewinding would be good (especially if I can get the video to sync up) and next pass time would be great",
      "I love it!My feature request is an option for a circle on the ground showing where the ISS is visible from at the moment.",
      "There are some crazy lightning storms over China in the live video feed at the moment. Very cool.One thing I would change is to change the yellow dot to an actual image of the ISS. It would also be cool to be able to zoom in a little bit more (and maybe use some higher resolution images of the globe).",
      "It did originally have a little model of the ISS actually but I ran into some issues with the model loader - going to try and reinstate that feature",
      "Looking at your real-time cloud rendering, have you considered trying to interpolate between the images provided every 3 hours by EUMETSAT? I have tried this using images from DISCOVR but I'm not totally happy with the result. I wonder if you or anyone else might have some ideas to get more realistic movement between the clouds inbetween each 3 hour interval?https://github.com/alexspurling/earthflow",
      "I don\u2019t know if it is interesting for this project, but I recently set up a Grafana dashboard for the telemetry feed from the ISS:https://github.com/Radiergummi/iss-metricsThere\u2019s also data on the position and rotation of various parts of the station in this feed.\nMight make for some interesting options when rendering the station!",
      "Ooh very interesting, thanks! I did have a little model of the ISS in place of the yellow dot originally but I ran into some issues with it. Would be very interesting to get that fixed up and rendering accurately too"

    "summary": "In a groundbreaking fusion of idle curiosity and advanced procrastination, a tech enthusiast unveils a 3D ISS tracker complete with live video and *near-realtime clouds*, compelling hordes of Hacker News commenters to crawl out of their productivity shells. Forgetting momentarily that professional software developers might prioritize legible text over an orbiting space station in their terminal, one optimistic soul dreams of integrating live cloud data into their command-line interface\u2014a place historically known for ASCII art and *not* high-definition photographs of Mother Earth. Suggestions fly about adding unnecessary features like a \"rewind functionality\" and a *highly requested* ISS-shaped cursor, because, naturally, the next frontier in space exploration is making sure you can play back its journey as if it were a missed episode of your favorite TV show. Meanwhile, another commentator wonders if adding more realistic cloud movements at 3-hour intervals might be possible, because what's the point of tracking a multi-billion-dollar space station if the clouds it flies over don't move smoothly? The thread predictably evolves into a tech support forum, proving once again that no virtual space project is complete without a dozen unsolicited feature requests and a nostalgic yearning for more accurate space-cloud simulations."

      "I would like to see something that records your keystrokes and gives you stats on what you type the most. Then spits out a keyboard arrangement to start from.Not sure how you'd get around it being a huge security risk? Maybe only write totals for keypresses every 30 minutes?Edited to add: Does anyone daily-drive a Keyboardio Model 100? I really liked the concept and participated in the kickstarter, but unfortunately found I didn't enjoy using it that much.I've settled on a Keychron Q10 with the Alice layout[1]. It's a nice compromise between the full on split and standard keyboards. It's nice and heavy, with QMK/VIA customization, and some useful macro keys I assign to some Emacs shortcuts like M-x and C-g. I do wish it had a thumb wheel and/or some Moonlander-style thumb keys below the space bars.[1] https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q10-alice-layout-...",
      "ZSA, the company behind the moonlander now has a heatmap extension [1]. After running it you get an idea of where your heavy keys are.When creating my own (slightly) modified qwerty layout I found it helpful to identify which areas of the keyboard was overloaded.https://blog.zsa.io/2012-introducing-heatmaps/",
      "You don't need a keylogger. Just take some things you've written and count the characters. It won't be exact since it excludes rewrites but the distribution should be very close.",
      "The SwiftKey keyboard (mobile) used to (maybe even today) ask for your Gmail account, goes through your stuff, recognizes your style and includes your vocabulary.Ignoring the obvious privacy issues, it provides great suggestions and learns some words that are not in the other keyboards' dictionaries.Maybe you could apply the same for aiding an algorithm to create a personalized keyboard layout.",
      "> I would like to see something that records your keystrokes and gives you stats on what you type the most. ... Not sure how you'd get around it being a huge security risk?A small program that locally collects data and lets you analyze it locally is pretty much a definition of a computer!  IMHO this is not the place to worry about a security risk.Note that the author had video of herself typing and it probably didn't trigger the \"security risk\" reflex because it's so obviously safe -- safe enough to post in this case.  I mean I'm typing right now and when I push the \"reply\" button the result of my typing will be posted right to the Internet with no access restriction!.Anyway, with that out of the way: I like your idea.  With the raw data stream you can look not just for simple frequency but n-grams as well.  The same data stream could be used to design single-handed chord keyboards as well, and even malleable layouts for programs with shitty key assignments (I refuse to call them \"shortcuts\").",
      "> records your keystrokes and gives you statsI wrote a little Emacs Lisp for this, never published it. I kinda doubt that a similar script would be as easy to write for an OS less friendly than Emacs.",
      "I\u2019ve been tinkering with some ideas around this based on the Halmak project [1] which used a genetic algorithm to choose the layout. Some day I\u2019ll do a writeup about it.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20200220112444/http://nikolay.ro...",
      "I've built exactly that, but need to polish it a bit before releasing. Hopefully will have time to do it soon.",
      "The problem with that - the same problem layouts like Dvorak have but worse - is that I sometimes have to use other computers.  Any custom layout will be great for me - once I put forth the effort to learn it of course, but since it will only be for me nobody else can use my computer (This computer I'm using now I don't care as only I touch it).  However I have computers that others in my family also use, computers at work where sometimes I share a keyboard.  All of that becomes impossible and that negative is greater than any potential benefit.",
      "It's my own experience, and it anecdotally seemed to be shared with other people who have modified their main keyboard:The regular qwerty/qwertz keyboards are so ingrained in our muscle memory and society (think touchscreen keyboards) that they still work as backups and you do not \"forget\" how to efficiently use regular keyboards. I guess it does depend on how often you're swapping around."

One brave soul suggests that a dash of privacy invasion, \u00e0 la the golden days of SwiftKey's Gmail rummaging, could birth the perfect typing experience. Meanwhile, others in this cavalcade of ergonomics refuse to acknowledge the looming specter of having to _actually use_ these Frankenlayouts on any device not soldered by their own hands."

      "You're right that it doesn't help, but looking at regular non-technical people like my retired parents for example, I really wonder if it's a realistic expectation that people know what the important part of a URL are.They need to parse slashes, dots, colons and ats (remember URLs can contain credentials, even though I believe browser issue warnings these days), identifiy the TLD and the domain and then know what is legit and what isn't. And know that things like onmicrosoft.com is legit while atmicrosoft.com is probably not. Or whatever link shortener some legit organizations are using.",
      "The root of all these things is companies, banks, and governments offloading the responsibility of security on to the worst possible person - the end user.\"Identify theft\" should simply not be a thing at all - it's fraud against the bank and the person's whose \"identity\" was stolen shouldn't be involved. Combined with simple fraud chargebacks that make the bank accountable if they can't make their (fraudulent) customer accountable would reduce much of it.",
      "The Internet has been around long enough at this point. Maybe your parents might never be able to read a URL and there will always be people who get scammed.But we should be taking the obvious steps like enforcing government domains on .gov . Attacks and scams are getting more sophisticated, so I hope when I'm elderly I can atleast check the .gov portion and know it's an actual government website.",
      "It's not just the elderly generation though. Young people mostly use apps and might barely interact with an actual browser. Big browsers de-emphasize the URL bar more and more. Yes, you and I and probably everyone on HN  will never have a problem with this, but significant portions of the population will. I think it's a hard problem.",
      "Isn't the simple solution to this to get everyone to use the USPS app?",
      "That's like suggesting people don't need to know what the zip code is because it's often redundant and omitted. People are often lazy, but it's immediately obvious to anyone that omitting the full 9-digit zip code could result in the letter being misdelivered, even if I don't understand what the last 4 digits are even for.",
      "I'm 38, live in the SF Bay area, and have never given anyone more than the first 5 digits in my life.  Online some might auto correct, but I've never learned them in my life and never even considered I should.",
      "The Zip+4 last four digits align to delivery zones.  It can be trivially constructed from the complete address now that we have reliable digital mapping systems, and in fact this is what happens internally in the postal system.It is not required and will likely never be required to provide a 9 digit ZIP for reliable delivery.  It may, and does sometimes, impact speed of delivery due to sorting/distribution rounds.",
      "It's honestly not that obvious. I never knew there's a difference between the 5-digit and 9-digit versions of my zip code. Most checkout flows do not even allow me to input more than 5 digits in the first place. But upon receiving my mail, the 5-digit code is always corrected to the 9-digit one.I had never considered that if there were multiple 9-digit expansions of a 5-digit zip code, the correction might turn out wrong unless the full 9-digit code is specified."
