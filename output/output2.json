I find that rather troubling.  Indeed, OCSP Watch is currently reporting several forgotten NETLOCK certificates. (The certificates from other CAs are recently issued and will probably have OCSP responses provisioned in the near future.)CRLs can't be used to detect this, because they only list revoked certificates rather than providing a definitive status for every issued certificate.I do wish the root programs had merely removed the requirement to include an OCSP URL in certificates, but required OCSP URLs for every issuer to be disclosed in the CCADB.

Every dollar or hour of engineering time that Let's Encrypt spends on OCSP (and it is a considerable amount) is a dollar or hour not being spent on other parts of the CA.

      "I am polish but only been in Warsaw recently and I was surprised by how beautiful the city is.I traveled all around Eastern Europe and I put it definitely higher in my rankings than Prague and Budapest.I can see the point of those who may disagree, it's a matter of taste, but I find Warsaw one of the most beautiful cities in Europe for a weekend (whereas the likes of Rome, Paris, London can simply not be appreciated well in such a short time span).\n \nreply",
      "As a person who lives here - I can say Warsaw is a great city to live in. I\u2019ve considered many destinations for emigrating and in the end decided to stay. Anecdotally, so did many others I know.Green, walkable, clean, good public transport, mostly-well-connected airport, reasonable cost of living (esp. if you work remotely as a software engineer\u2026), good and varied restaurants, and very safe.\n \nreply",
      "I spent a week in Warsaw in 2020 (right before the world shut down, to a point where it was not 100% clear I'd be let back in the US), and thought it was an extremely underrated city. As you said, very clean and walkable, and as an American it's really cheap due to the exchange rate.I go to Poland nearly every year because of Lambda Days, which is in Krakow, though next time I fly over I might take the train over to Warsaw again.\n \nreply",
      "My memory of Warsaw was a very interesting traffic deadlock around a block with two roundabouts in the city centre.There were simply too many cars around that block so they effectively locked each other up. That was ten years ago though so maybe they fixed it.A big part of my time there was spent in a taxi.\n \nreply",

      "> Green, walkableFor someone from Gda\u0144sk this is laughable. The city is very car-centric. There are large areas of it that are just concrete with no green in sight. This contributes to absurdly high temperatures in the summer and difficulty of finding any shade. \u201cPatelnia\u201d (frying pan) has that name for a reason and it\u2019s by no means the only such place. The city also keeps building glass skyscrapers which reflect sunlight onto the ground in already heat-stroke-inducing heat. It\u2019s laden with huge intersections with 2-phase crossings, which you need to run through in order to go through in one go. If you fail, you\u2019ll be stranded on a concrete island breathing in fumes from car traffic. Public transport is good if you can use the metro. But there are only 2 lines, so aside from maybe going to work you\u2019ll most likely be using a bus. The bus is most likely to be going regularly late and overcrowded (god I hate 186).\n \nreply",
      "> \u201cPatelnia\u201d (frying pan) has that name for a reason and it\u2019s by no means the only such place.That reason was actually retconned.Back when the term was coined there weren't that many cars in Warsaw and summers were not this hot.Most likely it was simply the first association anyone had looking at it when emerging from the subway.\n \nreply",
      "There's also trams, and the bike infrastructure - 9 out of 12 month I use virtually only scooters / bikes to travel around. And that is from Saska K\u0119pa travelling to Mokot\u00f3w/\u017boliborz/Wola/Ochota.\n \nreply",
      "I don't live in Poland but Saska Kepa is fantastic.\n \nreply",
      "The greenery is a spectrum of course, depending on how close to the very center of the city you are. I never had big problems with busses, but trams are good too, and I generally prefer them.I disagree with it not being walkable somewhere though. You can easily get anywhere on foot, and safely. Never had an issue with that anywhere in the city. It could definitely be more cyclable, as there are still many places without a dedicated biking lane (and you have to use the road or sidewalk), but walkable it definitely is.\n \nreply"

Do you support that (via a local install or by relaying a connection to local python install)?Or would all Python code have to run on your cloud servers (and thus not have access to things like high-end GPUs and such)?\n \nreply",

It is viewed by many as the foundation of computer science.My colleague shared it with me because it contains a neat use of topology. In this paper Turing gives a topological argument that every written alphabet must be finite. For example, our alphabet has 26 letters, 52 including both capital and lower case, 10 numerals, numerous punctuation marks, etc. Finitely many. Even if we came up with a scheme to generate new symbols, we would only be able to create finitely many.Here is the explanation in Turing\u2019s own words (we\u2019re particularly interested in the accompanying footnote).Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper.

As revolutionary as finding out water is wet. Meanwhile, other aspiring geniuses dive into fractal fonts and multidimensional glyphs, conjuring up ways to defy Turing\u2019s tyranny of finiteness with schemes you'd expect from someone who took \"Inception\" way too literally. \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\ude05"

      "> Shakespeare\u2019s plays, according to Knights, were first and foremost \u201cdramatic poems,\u201d works of literary art unified through metaphor and language, rather than a record of interactions between characters. To treat Macbeth as the final episode in the life of Macbeth was to confuse literature and history, to take the figures of drama for real persons, with biographies that reached back before the beginning of the play and, if they survived, into its imaginary future.While I'll agree with Knights that \"How many children\" is an absurd and pointless question, I otherwise disagree with his position.For example, a King of Scotland (well, Alba) named Macbeth was a historical figure and people watching the play would know this.  It doesn't make Macbeth one of the historical plays, but it's a deliberate call out to context (else he could have named the character \"King Bob\", as he did with the characters Romeo and Juliet, or King Lear).Both art and discourse are full of such, often not even deliberately invoked by the speaker or author.  We just swim in multiple contexts simultaneously.\n \nreply",
      "For the lazy:The historical Lady Macbeth had a son from her prior marriage, Lulach, who was accepted as heir by her husband and succeeded him to the throne. But he was a weak king and got killed within a year.\n \nreply",
      "It's hard to take Macbeth seriously as a history... what with the witches and all. His source is a piece of propaganda that makes Richard III look like a documentary.As a drama, the fact that the Macbeths appear to have zero children is very important. Fathers and sons are recurring themes -- Duncan's rebuff of Macbeth as the next King, Macduff and his son, Siward and Young Siward, etc.The absence of a descendant for Macbeth is evocative, especially given Lady Macbeth's line that she has \"given suck\". It doesn't get a lot of attention past that one, but it appears that within the context of the play, they had a child who died young.These are facts about the play that inform an actor and director making character choices. They're free to ignore them and focus on other things. (Honestly, it's not clear that Shakespeare really thought that through, either.)\n \nreply",
      "I tend to agree. It's not a meaningless question but definitely not one that the actor playing Lady Macbeth needs to answer for herself.As for \"having multiple children leads to downward mobility\" -- I'm not saying it's wrong, but I'd like to see some actual data on that. I thought the pattern was more \"first son inherits, second son goes into the Army or Navy, third et al go into the clergy.\" And a clerical life was not bad at all, until 1850 or so.For multiple daughters: well, if they don't all have great dowries, then they don't get high born husbands. They still get married.\n \nreply",
