      "I didn't see any mention of having a spinning surface.A tapered cylinder \"gravity gym\" with adjustable angled walls, and variable speed spinning, could smoothly create much greater \"gravity\".Spin gravity would also enable body weight exercises, core exercises, stationary or small area cardio like exercise bikes, VR games, yoga, etc. Even sleeping.EDIT: I missed this:> but Moon-based centrifuges allowing locomotion inside would pose technical challengesStill think it will be inevitable. Far more useful physically and psychological. \"Spinning surface\" is a simple challenge, compared to \"low-g health deterioration\" and \"bored to death of running in circles\".Equipment like this might resolve issues with off-world childbearing. Time to \"spin up\" some space rabbits!Spin areas will surely become ubiquitous in all low gravity colonies.Startup anyone?",

So the claim here is that exposure to a force similar to Earth gravity for \"a few laps a day\" would prevent/reduce whole-body deconditioning?I guess that makes sense too, since a few reps of weightlifting every couple days is enough to trigger muscle growth and bone densification.",

Tested by hitting whoami.filippo.io, linked in child comment.",
      "For a cool example (deanonymization), see https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/whoami-updated/ (discussed at time: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34301768). Someone has crawled public keys from GitHub (tbh I was surprised that GitHub publishes them) and set up a database.",
      "> You can make a search for all users, which will tell you there are 97,616,627 users at the time of this writing, but you can only fetch at most 1000 results from a search, and they don\u2019t come in any clear order, so you can\u2019t just make the next search start where the previous one left off (or I didn\u2019t figure out how).> What you can do though is request accounts created in a certain time range. If you get the time range right, so that it has less than 1000 entries, you can paginate through it, and then request the next time range.This reminds me of when I tried to add a google drive storage backend to camlistore/perkeep (because I had nearly-unlimited free quota at the time).  One of the things a perkeep blobserver needs to be able to do enumerate all the blobs it has, in order.  You can send millions of blobs to google drive without issue, but you can't directly paginate a search for them in sorted order.You could just issue a search for all blobs under your perkeep drive folder, keep paginating the result until you run out of pages, and then sort in memory, but there's really no way of knowing how many blobs you're going to end up with and you might blow out your blobserver's memory.Perkeep blobs are identified by blobrefs, SHA sums of the contents of the blob, so they look like sha-[0-9a-f]{64}.  Google drive lets you search for files with a name prefix, so you can search for like /perkeep/sha-* and see if the result has a pagination token (indicating that there are more than 1000 results), and if so then you search for each of /perkeep/sha-0*, /perkeep/sha-1*, ... , /perkeep/sha-f*, each time checking to see whether there are too many matches.  When there's not too many matches, you've found the prefix length that will let you fetch a bounded number of blobrefs, emit them to the perkeep client, and then release the memory before fetching more.  /pk/sha-\\*          1000+ results (non-empty pagination token)\n    /pk/sha-0\\*       1000+ results (non-empty pagination token)\n      /pk/sha-00\\*    1000+ results (non-empty pagination token)\n        /pk/sha-000\\*  193  results,\n                       sort these in memory and emit to client\n        /pk/sha-001\\*  179  results,\n                       sort these in memory and emit to client\n        ...\n        /pk/sha-fff\\*  223  results,\n                       sort these in memory and emit to client\n\nI didn't end up landing the patch before I lost interest, partly because it was pretty much the first golang I had tried writing.  It was fun working out the above details, though.",

      "The \"Merkle tree\" algorithm here isn't using a Merkle tree, it's just a binary partitioning algorithm. The point of a Merkle tree is that it's a tree of hashes. Also, it doesn't really solve the consistency problem the author claims is the biggest problem; yes, over time it will correct for Elasticsearch's eventual consistency, but in the short run it's just as bad as pagination.I don't know the author's application, but I question the desire to get a consistent dump from Elasticsearch in the first place. It is very not much intended to be a \"source of truth\", so you're better off streaming the data from your original data source, which is presumably something like an SQL database.That said, if you want a stable snapshot of an entire index \u2014 where your requirement is to not ever miss documents due to concurrent updates \u2014 then you can use Elasticsearch's snapshot support. Each snapshot is just that, a read-only snapshot of the data, allowing consistent reads.The eventual consistency problem that the article describes is solved by refreshing the index. You can use \"refresh=wait_for\" when doing an update in order to wait for Elasticsearch to make the update searchable. You can also force a refresh. Any subsequent query will return the newest indexed data.Since 6.x, Elasticsearch has had docvalue pagination via \"search_after\", which allows pagination without a durable cursor. Each cursor value is the docvalue set of the last seen document. This is consistent insofar as the set of source documents is consistent (so it's not safe against concurrent updates). There's essentially little need to use \"_scroll\" or offset-based pagination anymore.",
      "I think the author was using the search_after strategy (or something roughly equivalent). They were using \u2018cursor\u2019 in the generic sense as a place in the list of documents, rather than the specific durable cursors api offered by elasticsearch",
      "ok, I obviously don't know all the issues this team is dealing with, but it seems to be the goal of what they were doing was this...take the base data in one ES instance and split it out into several ES instances.The way do do that is to go back to the data of record and repopulate the different ES instances (or new datastore).

      "This is a generic problem across a vast range of technologies: how to handle scale out replication with delays and have a consistent \u201cstreaming\u201d experience.The main issue is that most query languages like SQL predate HTTP and haven\u2019t been updated with the same concepts such as ETag headers and cookies.Every database request should include a transaction consistency header that contains a vector clock of logical replication status. Every response should include cache control headers and an updated vector clock. This should then be encrypted and bubbled up through the HTTP pipeline to the end clients.E.g.: a client should able to request a \u201csnapshot no older then T minutes\u201d for a report run and be able to return a cookie that ensures that subsequent queries remain consistent with that. Most databases can do this\u2026 for a single TCP socket connection only. They\u2019ll lose track of the context if the socket is closed or if multiple servers connect from a web farm.With an approach like this, any cache or any replica could be utilised for any query in a safe and consistent manner.Essentially, this would be fixing an impedance mismatch between a stateful connection-oriented system and a stateless request-response system.",

      "This is quite an interesting solution. Especially with DFS approach in mind. Thank you!",

In an answer to the question of why there is no evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth (called the Fermi paradox) despite the high probability of it existing, Szil\u00e1rd responded: \"They are already here among us \u2013 they just call themselves Hungarians.\"The group included Erdos and von Neumann.",
      "Wernher von Braun himself also wrote probably the first serious treatise on human missions to mars as well as a science fiction novel on the topic in 1948. Apparently the original German novel remains unpublished, but there is an English translation available. It\u2019s set in 1980.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Projecthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars:_A_Technical_TaleCheck out the second link\u2019s section about \u201cthe Elon\u201d.",
      "\"Elon Gates to reach the stars\"",
      "Are the Elon Gates made of sugar, I. E. Zucker? Elon Zucker Gates to reach the stars?",
      "> \"They are already here among us \u2013 they just call themselves Hungarians.\"Do Germans also have jokes like \"how many Hungarians does it take to screw in a light bulb\"?",
      "Those exist here at the expense of different peoples, depending where you are in Germany. Most popular, from what I can tell, are East Frisians, but that has to do with a comedian who made a lot of those jokes (Otto Waalkes).",
      "Possibly worth also including just how controversial Wernher von Braun is.Von Braun is a highly controversial figure widely seen as escaping justice for his Nazi war crimes due to the Americans' desire to beat the Soviets in the Cold Warhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun",
      "What does that have to do with the comment you're replying to?Edit: This is an honest question, I'm not familiar with the extent of his crimes, if any. It certainly doesn't seem like a clear-cut \"he was an objectively evil man but we looked the other way\" based on the Wikipedia article. It could very well be his account, which from a brief skim seems reasonable, is accurate?",
      "> I'm not familiar with the extent of his crimes, if any.He was the Nazis' best rocket engineer, responsible for, among other things, the V2s that devastated much of London. By the standards of the Nuremberg trials, he probably should have been tried and convicted. But he was never even accused, because the US wanted his rocket expertise--by the time of the Nuremberg trials, he was already working for the US Army.",
      "> By the standards of the Nuremberg trials, he probably should have been tried and convicted. But he was never even accused, because the US wanted his rocket expertise--by the time of the Nuremberg trials, he was already working for the US Army.Absurd. For starters, by the standards of the nuremberg trials, there's no way in hell he would be convicted. For comparison, among the men actually acquitted by the nuremburg trials were Franz von Papen, Hitler's vice chancellor from 1933 to 1934 and the man who pressured Hindenburg to appoint Hitler to power, and Hans Fritzsche, a high ranking propagandist who was in the Fuhrerbunker in the last days of the war and after his acquittal took part in a cabal attempting to re-nazify West Germany.The nuremberg trials targetted only the very highest level Nazis - only the top 5 highest ranking officers in the entire german military were indicted. Even if von Braun had been an enthusiastic Nazi (and there's quite a bit of evidence he wasn't), he was way too low level to have been tried nonetheless convicted by the Nuremberg trials."

Their code seemed aimed at smaller sizes. Instead I chose a different representation, aka fourier coefficients that are used to interpolate the functions of individual coordinates.It should give an idea of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks representation power, it should probably converge easier than their spline version but spline version have less operations.Of course, if my code doesn't work, it doesn't mean theirs doesn't.Feel free to experiment and publish paper if you want.",
      "How GPU-friendly is this class of models?",
      "Very unfriendly.The symbolic library (type of activations) requires a branching at the very core of the kernel. GPU will need to serialized on these operations warp-wise.To optimize, you might want to do a scan operation beforehand and dispatch to activation funcs in a warp specialized way, this, however, makes the global memory read/write non-coalesced.You then may sort the input based on type of activations and store it in that order, this makes the gmem IO coalesced but requires gather and scatter as pre and post processing.",
      "you really are a pragmatic programmer, Noesis",
      "Thanks. I like simple things.Sums and products can get you surprisingly far.Conceptually it's simpler to think about and optimize. But you can also write it use einsum to do the sum product reductions (I've updated some comment to show how) to use less memory, but it's more intimidating.You can probably use KeOps library to fuse it further (einsum would get in the way).But the best is probably a custom kernel. Once you have written it as sums and product, it's just iterating. Like the core is 5 lines, but you have to add roughly 500 lines of low-level wrapping code to do cuda parallelisation, c++ to python, various types, manual derivatives. And then you have to add various checks so that there are no buffer overflows. And then you can optimize for special hardware operations like tensor cores. Making sure along the way that no numerical errors where introduced.So there are a lot more efforts involved, and it's usually only worth it if the layer is promising, but hopefully AI should be able to autocomplete these soon.",

The training loss gets down to 1e-9, while test loss stays around 3e-1. Getting to larger network sizes does not help either.I would really like to see a bigger example with many more parameters and more data complexity and if it could be trained at all. MNIST would be a good start.Update: I increased the training dataset size 100x, and that helps with the overfitting, but now I can't get training loss below 1e-2. Still iterating on it; a GPU acceleration would really help - right now, my progress is limited by the speed of my CPU.1. https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan/blob/master/tutorials/...",

In the dataset generation, slightly reduced noise (0.1 -> 0.07) so that classes don't overlap. With an overlap, naturally, it's impossible to hit 100%.3. Most important & specific to KANs: train for 30 steps with grid=5 (5 segments for each activation function), then 30 steps with grid=10 (and initializing from the previous model), and then 30 steps with grid=20. This is idiomatic to KANs and covered in the Example_1_function_fitting.ipynb: https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan/blob/master/tutorials/...Overall, my impressions are:- it works!- the reference implementation is very slow. A GPU implementation is dearly needed.- it feels like it's a bit too non-linear and training is not as stable as it's with MLP + ReLU.- Scaling is not guaranteed to work well. Really need to see if MNIST is possible to solve with this approach.I will definitely keep an eye on this development.",

      "Impressive hack \u2014 kudos from a fellow sheet music software developer!I've spent more than 10 years now building Soundslice, which does web-based sheet music rendering. I believe we were the first to do \"responsive\" web notation (that part of the site launched in 2014).Here's a tech talk I gave with a lot of details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH5EtQge_BgHere's an example of responsive Soundslice notation: https://www.soundslice.com/slices/zzNlc/ (in the settings, set the stave width to maximum to get \"Fit to screen\" for the true responsive effect)We've got a whole suite of tools built around this, including an excellent web-based editor, rich practice functionality and a relatively new scanning feature (extracting the musical data from a photo or PDF).I agree with other commenters here that this CSS Grid approach could be handy for lightweight projects but it likely isn't up to snuff for the incredibly subtle and complex world of full scores. With that said, I just want to stress again that this is super cool and I'm glad it exists!",

      "A resonable icon format would be a vector file plus (at least optionally) 16 and 32px bitmap images. A 16x16 px icon is still common (eg toolbar buttons at desktop resolutions lower than 4K) and as evident by the article there is no way of rasterizing a vector image to 16x16 and preserving anything but a blurry mess. At least not without using a very clever (AI could possibly do it) rasterizer.The 16x16 representation is often completely different from the vector or 64x64 version. If you draw a clock, the large version is 3D has numbers and 3 hands. The smaller versions is 2D, has 2 hands and no digits.",
      "Many of us look at https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg at 16x16 every day, and wouldn't call it a blurry mess.",
      "I think that's because our screens all have 2x pixel density, so the icon is actually a half-size 32x32 image.",
      "HVIF supports having different shapes at different levels-of-detail in one file.",
      "> there is no way of rasterizing a vector image to 16x16 and preserving anything but a blurry mess.Deep learning suggests differently?",
      "24x24 and below still require special treatment because pixel grid alignment becomes really important. The tape recorder image demonstrates this well: the raster 16x16 looks way better than the vector. I wonder if it would generally be better to store these tiny sizes as bitmaps in the container.",
      "Yeah, I'm suprised the original article didn't mention that. One of the main reasons that smaller icons are stored as separate files is that they need to actually be designed differently, not just scaled down.",
      "Haiku icons have support for Level of Detail.",
      "Link: https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/applications/icon... under \"Level of Detail\"",
      "> If you use the standard bitmap icon formats, you\u2019ll probably store them in their own files, separate from the files that use them. In order to display each file in a folder, the operating system will need to read the metadata for the file (including its name and file type) and then read the icon file for that file type. If the icon file were so small that you could store it in the same place as the file metadata, then you could save a read from the hard drive \u2013 you could get the metadata and the icon all in one read.> ... it could be a significant performance gain to halve the number of disk reads even if rendering a vector image takes longer than rendering a bitmap.Surely another option would be to cache all the filetype icons in memory and thereby only read them once? You could still use this cool vector format and get the best of both worlds, so each icon would be small and would be read only once, and you wouldn't have duplicate icon data all over the disk. And then if you wanted to change the icon associated with a particular filetype, you wouldn't need to update every single inode for files of that type."

This is surprising both because most OSes consider bitmaps to be totally sufficient to represent icons and because there are plenty of vector graphics formats out this (e.g. SVG).

This allows Haiku to display icons as several sizes while still keeping the files small enough to fit into an inode (i.e., inside a file\u2019s metadata). The goal of keeping the icons in the metadata is to reduce the disk reads needed to display a folder \u2013 it allows each file to only require one disk read to display.",
