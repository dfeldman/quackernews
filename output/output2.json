      "Serious question here, not trying to give unwarranted stress to what is no doubt a stressful situation for the supabase team, or trying to create flamebait.This whole thing feels like its obviously a bad idea to have an mcp integration directly to a database abstraction layer (the supabase product as I understand it). Why would the management push for that sort of a feature knowing that it compromises their security? I totally understand the urge to be on the bleeding edge of feature development, but this feels like the team doesn't understand GenAi and the way it works well enough to be implementing this sort of a feature into their product... are they just being too \"avant-garde\" in this situation or is this the way the company functions?reply",
      "I have no association with Supabase, but in their defense, apart from adding a caution note, there's nothing else that Supabase needs to do, from my perspective.As far as I am concerned, this is not a serious security hole if the human developer exercises common sense and uses widely recognized security precautions while developing their system.reply",

      "Supabase engineer here working on MCP. A few weeks ago we added the following mitigations to help with prompt injections:- Encourage folks to use read-only by default in our docs [1]- Wrap all SQL responses with prompting that discourages the LLM from following instructions/commands injected within user data [2]- Write E2E tests to confirm that even less capable LLMs don't fall for the attack [2]We noticed that this significantly lowered the chances of LLMs falling for attacks - even less capable models like Haiku 3.5. The attacks mentioned in the posts stopped working after this. Despite this, it's important to call out that these are mitigations. Like Simon mentions in his previous posts, prompt injection is generally an unsolved problem, even with added guardrails, and any database or information source with private data is at risk.Here are some more things we're working on to help:- Fine-grain permissions at the token level. We want to give folks the ability to choose exactly which Supabase services the LLM will have access to, and at what level (read vs. write)- More documentation. We're adding disclaimers to help bring awareness to these types of attacks before folks connect LLMs to their database- More guardrails (e.g. model to detect prompt injection attempts). Despite guardrails not being a perfect solution, lowering the risk is still importantSadly General Analysis did not follow our responsible disclosure processes [3] or respond to our messages to help work together on this.[1] https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp/pull/94[2] https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp/pull/96[3] https://supabase.com/.well-known/security.txtreply",
      "Can this ever work? I understand what you're trying to do here, but this is a lot like trying to sanitize user-provided Javascript before passing it to a trusted eval(). That approach has never, ever worked.It seems weird that your MCP would be the security boundary here. To me, the problem seems pretty clear: in a realistic agent setup doing automated queries against a production database (or a database with production data in it), there should be one LLM context that is reading tickets, and another LLM context that can drive MCP SQL calls, and then agent code in between those contexts to enforce invariants.I get that you can't do that with Cursor; Cursor has just one context. But that's why pointing Cursor at an MCP hooked up to a production database is an insane thing to do.reply",
      "Right? \"Wrap all SQL responses with prompting that discourages the LLM from following instructions/commands injected within user data?\" The entire point of programming is that (barring hardware failure and compiler bugs) the computer will always do exactly what it's told, and now progress apparently looks like having to \"discourage\" the computer from doing things and hoping that it listens?reply",
      "The main problem seems to me to be related to the ancient problem of escape sequences and that has never really been solved. Don't mix code (instructions) and data in a single stream. If you do sooner or later someone will find a way to make data look like code.reply"

The system prompt, user instructions, and the data context is provided to the LLM as text.The core problem of LLMs interacting with tools is that they can not distinguish instructions from data. Therefore, if a caarefully crafted piece of user-provided \u201cdata\u201d happens to look like an instruction, the model may process it as one.To keep the demonstration self-contained, we spun up a fresh Supabase project that mirrors a typical multi-tenant customer-support SaaS.The instance was populated with dummy data only, Row-Level-Security (RLS) was enabled exactly as documented, and no additional extensions or policies were introduced.",

      "It's so, so , so hard to walk the line between persistence (which leads to glory) and stubbornness (which leads to more time following already wasted time.)Congratulations for walking this line correctly.I agree that some sort of market validation is necessary to at least pretend you are on the former not the latter. Those early usage spikes are helpful reminders that there is a business here somewhere.I'll also make a note that you spent time on marketing from the early days. Writing blog posts, promoting said posts, having a Discord server, committing to answer emails, all of this is marketing and its likely lead to success more than the code.I notice whenever there was a dip in revenue, marketing (in the form of more blog posts) was the response. I suspect that was intentional, and definitely a better approach than \"let me go away and silently code more features.\"So there are valuable lessons to others here. Congratulations not just on the current success but also on sharing the path that leads to success. Ultimately you can show the way, but you can't make people learn from it.Oh, and I like the bootstrapping approach. I did the same, and I'm not sorry.

I was thrilled to spend my free time treating those early customers like royalty and building more of what they wanted.If I had instead come into this with the expectation of quick success, I doubt I would have made it through those early years.And cheers from one bootstrapper to another.

Given they Global Foundries was always behind Intel, suddenly leapfrogging them by 2-3 years would be quite a feat.This is a very weak argument. Intel was ahead of everyone, now everyone is ahead of Intel. Remember TSMC's blunder processes like 20nm? How they turned around after that? Or how GloFo has had always mediocre processes but they finally hit the nail in the head with their 14/12nm? Fab business has always had companies leapfrogging each other, it turns out the worst sin is not trying. GloFo's greedy investors chose to bury the business in the ground for their short term profits.reply",
      "I thought it was a bad decision at the time, but it does seem like a defensible one to me, for three reasons.First, nobody knew if even TSMC was going to succeed at bringing a 7nm process to market.  02018 was maybe the height of the \"Moore's Law is over\" belief.  There was a lot of debate about whether planar semiconductor scaling had finally reached the limit of practical feasibility, although clearly it was still two orders of magnitude from the single-atom physical limit, which had been reached by Xie's lab in 02002.  Like Intel, SMIC didn't reach 7nm until 02023 (with the HiSilicon processor for Huawei's Mate60 cellphone) despite having the full backing of the world's most technically productive country, and when they did, it was a shocking surprise in international relations with the US.Second, even if GF had brought 7nm to market, there was no guarantee it would be profitable.  The most profitable companies in a market are not always the most technically advanced; often the pioneers die with arrows in their backs.  If you can make 7nm chips in volume, but the price for them is so high that almost everyone sticks with 12nm processes (maybe from your competitors), you can still lose money on the R&D.  Moore's Law as originally stated in \"Cramming\" was about how the minimum price per transistor kept moving to smaller and smaller transistors, and historically that has been an immensely strong impetus to move to smaller processes, but it's clearly weakened in recent years, with many successful semiconductor products like high-end FPGAs still shipping on very old process nodes.  (Leaving aside analog, which is a huge market that doesn't benefit from smaller feature size.)Third, we don't know what the situation inside GF was, and maybe GF's CEO did.  Maybe they'd just lost all their most important talent to TSMC or Samsung, so their 7nm project was doomed.  Maybe their management politics were internally dysfunctional in a way that blocked progress on 7nm, even if it hadn't been canceled.  There's no guarantee that GF would have been successful at mass production of 7nm chips even in a technical sense, no matter how much money they spent on it.In the end it seems like GF lost the bet pretty badly.  But that doesn't necessarily imply that it was the wrong bet.  Just, probably.reply",
      "As far as I know, Global Foundries ceased efforts at 7nm and lower because they could not afford it.They had previously signed a contract with IBM to produce silicon at these more advanced nodes that they could not honor, and there was legal action between them.https://www.anandtech.com/show/13277/globalfoundries-stops-a...https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-01-02-GlobalFoundries-and-IBM-...reply",
      "First, you point out that Moore's law was about the transistor count per chip at the optimum cost process, and that's very important. We have transitioned from a more-for-less leading edge to a more-for-more leading edge. It's overall sensible for Apple to build giant chips on the newest processor not because it's cheaper but because it gives them an overall more competitive product (they only sell whole devices). Just because Apple and Nvidia keep making bigger chips doesn't mean that Moore's law is working the way it was originally proposed (Intel's marketing department notwithstanding).In any case, at the time and still I think GF was probably correct in that they would not be able to compete at the leading edge and make money at it. Remember, AMD and IBM separated fabs out for a reason and not having the scale necessary to compete was probably a big part of that. AMD has succeeded on TSMC and IBM seems to be doing ok on Samsung. Most chips are not at the leading edge and don't need to be, and so most fabs don't need to be leading edge to serve customers. There are all kinds of applications where a more mature and better characterized process is better, whether for harsh environments, mixed signal applications, or just low volume parts where $20M of tooling cost is not worth it.reply",
      "> It was a competitive processDo you have any evidence, besides GF's own PR/IR department, that the process ever actually worked in volume? Because from my point of view, how they ended things looks exactly how I would spin away a multibillion-dollar investment into a failed process.reply",
      "No I don't, but then, how bad it could be? As bad as Samsung's 8nm? Or Intel's 10nm? Even they delivered something in the end. What did GF deliver? A whole fucking nothing. Samsung had Nvidia and Qualcomm as their customers even with its, ehm, not so good 8nm process. It was a sure bet GF was going to have some customers as long as they delivered something (and I don't even count AMD's wafer supply agreement).reply"

      "I played with Ceramic a bit and it was nice to have built-in imgui support out of the box.Haxe is a fun language. It could have taken TypeScript's place, if they focused on improving the tooling and ergonomics for Web developement instead of game development 15 years ago.reply",
      "> It could have taken TypeScript's placeIt was heavily inspired by ActionScript 3 which was the basis for the EcmaScript 4 proposal abandoned around 2008 iirc.We could have had something close to TS running natively in the browser 17 years ago.reply",
      "Shrug. I think this is a good illustration: it\u2019s not the language that\u2019s the issue, it\u2019s the DOM. The DOM was and continues to be a terrible UI abstraction for applications.What we really needed was Flex or XAML or Swing or even XUL, for that matter, to be built on a sandbox functional enough to make users happy but robust enough to run on the web. Instead each framework failed in turn to various platform dependency and/or security flaws until we ended up stuck with the DOM as our endgame.reply",
      "Have is a nice language, but it doesn't live up to it's promises.It's really cool that it can compile itself to a bunch of different languages, but the API isn't consistent enough for complex applications to work with all of its backends.reply"

Exploiting the tragically obscure Haxe language, this ceramic miracle manages to be compatible with everything while simultaneously being essential to nothing. The commenters, lost in nostalgia over ActionScript and mourning potential TypeScript usurpers, bemoan the DOM like it personally offended their ancestors. Meanwhile, a solitary voice pipes up to remind everyone that while Haxe might compile anywhere\u2014it really shouldn\u2019t. \ud83c\udfad"
