      "What the article does not seem to mention is that an usual electric wheelchair costs about $65,000 (and is intended to be replaced every six years or so). This and the non-availability of replacement parts is why some wheelchair users started a project to open-source a wheelchair from standard parts:https://themif.org/Louis Rossmann interviewed the founder of the project here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaAj59025Kk",
      "> is why some wheelchair users started a project to open-source a wheelchair from standard parts: https://themif.org/Can you point to any project site that has released anything along this line? Blueprints, bills of material, code? There's nothing on the site you linked having any such resources. The closest thing is a block diagram including an RS-485 motor controller, which doesn't really seem like an alternative to standard parts at first glance.",
      "We have collected all the documentation from the WHIM Wheelchair development effort at https://wiki.replimat.org/wiki/Wheelchairs",
      "To be honest - it actually seems like a risky Private Equity play as I bet the $65000 sticker price is due to the fact that Medicare is footing the bill.  Medicare is likely what is requiring a regulation grade wheel chair, not the users themselves.I bet a huge segment of the user base could easily self purchase a mobility scooter and achieve the same quality of life if the price point was such that they could out of pocket the purchase and there was decent quality/repairability/safety.There do seem to be a fair number that are approaching \"geez I might as well just buy an over the counter version\" (i.e. sub-$2000) instead of going through the paperwork hassle of getting a free Medicare \"prescription\" for one.",
      "In my experience, the chairs and how they\u2019re built aren\u2019t what adds to the price tag; the fact that an insurance company is paying is what is.My daughter literally just got approved for a talking device that would otherwise cost us $4000. It\u2019s a Samsung tablet with $300 software and an attached speaker and comes with some sort of repair agreement. I can buy and break 20 iPads for that price\u2026and we did end up buying one with the software on its own.If you want to know who\u2019s causing waste, look to the ones who stand to benefit from it.",
      "It\u2019s similar to defence procurement.If the customer is government with endless budget, inflate costs, and use regulatory capture to maintain the cash flow.",
      "Regulatory capture is likely the most important component. People complain about government spending, but those close to progressive issues can tell you that it's just as likely, if not more likely, to be remarkably stingy when it wants to be. The issue isn't government, it's who's using government; access to capital on top of that government influence gets you a lot closer to that bottomless wallet.",
      "Just that in this case the end-customer is a person that could shop around for what he/she needs. Such a competitive market would instantly vaporate the current, rent-seeking margins",
      "Not only that but also lobby the government to start more wars so there\u2019s a need for their product.https://x.com/snmrrw/status/1717906441925751223",
      "That tablet and software cost a large sum to be validated. Those CFRs get extremely expensive."

    "summary": "In today's thrilling episode of \"Capitalism Ruins Everything Around Me,\" Statnews.com serves up a half-baked panic pie about the horrific ordeal of obtaining a wheelchair when private equity is allowed to play monopoly with healthcare equipment. The article floats on a sea of despair, handily ignored by the techie savior complex in the comments, where digital messiahs propose open-sourcing the wheelchair as if healthcare systems worldwide are just waiting for their GitHub link. Commenters wag fingers at the government and Medicare, somehow concluding that everyone should just buy a mobility scooter at Walmart and hacking it with duct tape and dreams. Meanwhile, wheelchairs still cost as much as a brand-new Tesla, and Grandma is still stuck at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone to fix her $65,000 ride."

Also swiping left feels like rejecting them. What if I\u2019m just browsing the artists? I don\u2019t want to be rejecting while I\u2019m browsing options.Also why am I limited to my area? I want to be able to collaborate digitally. I don\u2019t need to be in close proximity to do that. I ran out of people in my area after 2 left swipes.I would like to just click on the genre of artist I want, hear a sample of their work and then be able to message and favorite the ones I like.",
      "Thanks for the feedback! Having a skip, but not reject sounds useful.I have in the roadmap a \"don't limit to my area\" option!Also plan to have some sort of inline playable sample on the profile, but haven't figured out the best way to do that - video vs audio vs embedding SoundCloud or YouTube.",
      "A neat idea would be to have \u201cprojects.\u201d Each account/profile has a default/personal \u201cproject,\u201d meaning a contained instance of matching. But they\u2019re also able to create additional \u201cprojects.\u201d So if someone wants to look for a match for a specific project or a new band they can create a new project and swipe across all accounts. Would be cool to set up filters when creating a project, so that the options to swipe are more relevant to the current \u201cproject\u201d at hand. Making it easier to find a match",
      "Does the app feature music by musicians? As a musician that's what I'd expect to see myself, because seeing a bunch of people only talking about what they do is useless in terms of conveying style and skill. It also enables scammers and fraud if people aren't required to at least upload a video of themselves in action.Back in the old days, we had a local paper that allowed musicians to connect from a classified section, and boy was it scary meeting some of the strangers that posted in there to jam.",
      "Since this is the first iteration, I went the easiest route where people link their SoundCloud/Spotify/or Youtube channel.I considered having MP3 uploads or even video uploads, but didn't seem worth it building a transcoding/streaming system, when someone could still upload things that is not them playing.Another idea is to \"verify\" linked Spotify accounts by having the artist place a short random code in their Spotify bio, to prove they are actually the artist.",
      "It\u2019s awesome that you did the simplest thing. Whenever I\u2019ve done these kinds of attempts to collab with strangers online kinds of things, I\u2019ve always found that people will express a desire to be in a band but are awful at creating music. Just requesting that someone posts a sample through another channel is a great idea. Do you think this could become toxic though? Like people stealing tracks and trying to release them? My guess is no but you never know.Anyway - great call on the song requirement, for a lot of us, it\u2019s important to know that the people we work with can operate a daw and solve their own problems and care about creating a finished product. Unless they\u2019re incredibly talented instrumentalists (usually not the case, they find bands) at a certain point it becomes either a jam sesh (not interested) or you become a producer for someone who isn\u2019t very good.",

Soundcloud is more likely, but still not a given, as it's geared towards mostly finished tracks.  Hint:  the most sought after band members are bassists and drummers, and they don't tend to do solo tracks.You want people to be able to have a low quality video of them noodling or playing along to something for 30 seconds.",

      "Anyone with the slightest bit of interest in the tales should read the recent English translation of the first edition. \nhttps://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/the-original...\nor\nhttps://archive.org/details/originalfolkfair0000unse\nIt's obvious reading the originals that it they were more a collection of tales with no particular moral, some unspeakable brutality, and a ton of hallucinatory weirdness. Why does an anthropomorphic needle go down the road? Heck if I know! The later versions, as explained in the preface of the above book, were sanitized and Christianized for popular consumption.",
      "I think there are morals in Grimms Fairy Tales even in the earliest versions. What is striking to me when I read them is that many of the stories come from people at the bottom level of society and reflected their struggle for survival. These include terrifying consequences for misbehavior and that violating group norms (including those imposed from above) is a big no-no. A lot of the stories feature tricksters who cleverly got around these restrictions.These patterns don't show up clearly in individual stories. But it's pretty strong if you read them from end to end.",
      "Yeah, this is definitely the case IME. It's easy to read these stories and go away thinking \"WTF.\" But it's important to remember that these stories come from oral societies, which means 90% of the communication is lost since it's only written on paper. But that communication can be reconstructed by a charitable mind.For example, in the first story in Grimm's Fairy Tales (at least the version I read), there's a mouse and a cat that are friends. The cat and mouse find some delicious food and they hide it somewhere far away from their house. The cat then proceeds to go \"visiting relatives\" (in reality he is eating up the delicious food) and the mouse is gullible and believes the cat. After a while the mouse discovers the cat ate up all the food and angrily accuses the cat of being deceitful. The cat then proceeds to eat the mouse. The end.I think this is a profound story on not ignoring the fact that the cat is the natural predator and the mouse is the natural prey in the relationship. The mouse has convinced itself that this time will be different. This has relevance for e.g. not dismissing signs of abuse.But it's so easy to read that story and be like, \"Well, I guess the point is that gullible people get screwed, so don't be gullible.\" Or even, \"It's a dog-eat-dog world.\" It's a good story to tell a friend who's trying to rationalize being passive in an abusive relationship.",
      "To me that story reads like thinly veiled political commentary. Peasants and feudal lords/nobility/local government working towards a common goal (e.g. paying taxes to fund defense against bandits, building grain stores for times of famine, etc). A person in power misappropriates the funds for personal gain, and any peasant who complains loses their head.Telling a story about a mouse and a cat allowed you to keep your head, and the situation was probably common enough for the fable to become widely known before it was picked up by the Bothers Grimm.It's not that different from Gulliver's Travels complaining about pointless religious wars under the guise of talking about far-away islands of tiny humans, or Star Trek criticizing the Vietnam War under the guise of talking about a primitive planet light-years away centuries in the future.",
      "My thoughts were this might also be on the World politics level. E.g. a case where a stronger country during wartime will co operate with weaker country, and then slowly infiltrate because it's easier than to do full on invasion.Then finally when weaker country starts to complain they will completely take over. The stronger country in theory could at any time swallow the weaker, it's just that it might be more beneficial for stronger country to do it in a slower, methodical, deceiving manner, until it can. Or when it actually needs to.In this case it seems to me it was strategic behavior by the cat to not immediately eat the mouse, but instead consume the fat first. Eating the mouse was a fallback in this scenario.But overall this specific scenario happens on so many levels of relationships including, but not limited to interpersonal, business, country level, World level, etc.The main key points in my view are that it is a cat, and cat always will want to eat the mouse in what you would think is pscyhopathic mannerism if it was between people, but it's most easily explainable on level of countries. Because ultimately countries as entities have to act in psychopathic ways with each other, because territories, resources are all  clearly limited.Due to the complexity of World politics you have to co operate with your enemies as well. Both sides are lying to each other, keeping secrets, but at the same time co operating, because they have to or they otherwise will fall behind other countries.",
      "> in the first story in Grimm's Fairy TalesIt's the second story. The first is the \"frog prince\".> The cat then proceeds to eat the mouse.Even the english Wikipedia article does not mention the most important part:    When she beholds the empty pot, enlightenment dawns on the mouse: \"First 'Top-off,' \" she murmurs, \"then 'Half-gone,' and then ...\" The cat warns her to say no more, but the mouse persists. The cat pounces on the mouse and eats her up.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_and_Mouse_in_Partnership#P...The mouse says \"All-gone\" and is than eaten because of that. And the first version does not contain the phrase   \"And that is the way of the world,\" the story closes.\n\nat the end, it ends with the cat eating the mouse",
      "Yeah dang I just read the original version and the moral is a double whammy of don't fool yourself into being deceived/oppressed by a predator, but if you do, don't ever call them out on it!",
      "> It's a good story to tell a friend who's trying to rationalize being passive in an abusive relationship.Uhmm ... so they should be passive or they will get killed? I guess that was not the point you were trying to make? Like, warn them, that if they don't play their cards right, it will end bad, like for the mouse?",

      "Related, there are a few cryptocurrencies that used things related to finding large primes as part of their proof of work functions. It turns out that ~8 years ago, a really fast primality test implementation could make you a lot of money. (For some period of time I was the author and maintainer of mining software for riecoin. Why, I have no idea, except that I like prime numbers.)This article omits the number one optimization for fast primality testing: Montgomery multiplicationhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_modular_multiplic...It forms the basis of fast practical modular exponentiation implementations.Niall Emmart, then in academia and now I believe at Nvidia, released a really, spectacularly fast GPU bigint library, CGBN: https://github.com/NVlabs/CGBNIt's still the fastest batch modexp implentation that I'm aware of. It's breathtaking, if I can gush in geek for a moment.(Someday I should write up the story of how that helped me dominate production of a small cryptocurrency for about 5 years. Thanks, Niall - owe you a beer if we ever cross paths!)Also worth noting that python includes an entirely fine modexp in the three-argument form of pow(x, y, m) --> compute x^y % mWith that, you can very easily implement a fermat or miller-rabin primality test if you want to roll your own, which is quite fun. If you don't, the gmp library provides a very nice mpz_probab_prime() function. Gmp is obviously faster, but it's hard to beat the fun of a two liner fermat test for playing with big primes.",
      "Great stuff dga :)Turns out, Niall was also involved in one of the winning ZPrize submissions for fast multi-scalar multiplication (closely related to batch modexp, although over an elliptic curve rather than mod a prime); I assume it inherits from his work on CGBN.He give a very nice talk about it last year at a Stanford crypto lunch, and it turns out the slides and recording are online!https://cbr.stanford.edu/seminarTalks/slides_20230526_niall_...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAWlySN7Hm8",
      "I'd love to read that story. Please do write it up!",
      "> This is where things start to get interesting. At first, I found the concept of probabilistic primality tests strange and tried to look for deterministic algorithms that could handle huge numbers. I did find two - APR-CL and ECPP. Both of these are so mathematically complex that I could not make sense of their research papers at all, and there isn't much accessible information about them on the internet for someone like me who is bad at math.> After taking a look at discussions online, OpenSSL's source code and recommendations by NIST, I realized that almost everyone including RSA uses probabilistic algorithms. The catch is that if implemented properly, these algorithms have an extremely low error rate which is negligible.For a given maximum number range, it's trivial to make Miller-Rabin actually deterministic. You just choose bases that have been proven to together exclude all pseudoprimes in the given range.(It doesn't even end up being a long list, Miller-Rabin kicks ass)",

      "You can find the bases for N < 3x10^21 on wikipedia [0] which make Miller-Rabin deterministic. 1024 bit numbers have ~300 digits and as far as i know, no known bases exist for that range.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality...",
      "Just testing all the bases from 2 through 2 log(N)^2 doesn't actually seem to be too bad for N around 2^1024. It would be a little under 1007600 bases.I've got a Miller-Rabin implementation in Python 3. Testing 2^1024 + 643, which is the first prime greater than 2^1024 with 65 random bases takes about 0.25 seconds on my Mac Studio. This is with no attempts at optimization or at using multiple cores.At that rate testing 1007600 bases would take under 65 minutes.Certainly way longer than you'd want to wait around for something like key generation, but if you didn't actually need your prime for an hour and really wanted to be certain it was a prime its not outrageous.",

      "Capsize is great! It's worth noting that it's not really a \"JS hack\": it doesn't require you to ship JavaScript to the browser. Capsize is written in JavaScript, but it's just a function that takes information about a specific font and typography information and outputs static styles, meaning you can run Capsize at build time or even just copy the generated CSS straight from their web site.",

      "margin-trim is basically a simpler alternative to adding a margin-bottom to every child, then removing the margin-bottom from the last child with :last-child { margin-bottom: 0; }Flex with gap is also an alternative to that, and in my view should be the default thing you reach for. But there are some cases where the child margin approach has benefits, particularly if you're doing certain animations/transitions or if you want each child to essentially override its top or bottom gap.",
      "But can't you do .selector:not(:last-child) ? Or .selector + .selector ? Both of these seem clearer than adding an extra property just to handle this case.Like, I understand the situation, I've been in that place plenty of times. But I've never felt in want of a solution there.",
      "I often use the so-called \"lobotomized owl selector\" (* + *) in the reset I use for my own internal tools. More specifically:    * {\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 0;\n    }\n\n    * + * {\n      margin-top: 1em;\n    }",

They're not on the list.[1] Until a company gets on that list, which has a fee, the AAA will refuse to run arbitrations involving contracts specifying AAA arbitration. The AAA does this to prevent companies from adding additional unfavorable terms to arbitration agreements.At least Discord specified AAA arbitration. They're considered legitimate.

The number of people who are eligible to opt out now (those who already opted out in previous iterations) is microscopic compared to Discord's wider user base, and I would be absolutely shocked if a single person involved in this actually ends up suing Discord either individually or as part of a class.Whether or not you believe forced arbitration is bad, it seems like there have to be higher value causes to get up in arms about right now.",
      "As a consumer, I\u2019m not sure I understand the disdain for forced arbitration. I understand discord desires it because it helps prevent rulings becoming case law.But I am going through forced arbitration right now in a personal lawsuit, and part of it is bleeding to a third party that does not arbitrate, which means real court. By all accounts I have been assured by my lawyer we are in a better position pursuing arbitration over litigation. Both seem to be quite expensive options, though fortunately there is a clause for legal fees to the prevailing side (and in my case evidence in my favor is airtight).Any enlightenment would be wonderful.",
      "Forced arbitration reduced your options. You can agree to arbitration if both parties desire it when a dispute arises.One of the biggest consumer protections that a forced arbitration clause can kill is a class action lawsuit. If a corporation harms each consumer for $.30, there\u2019s no real way to bring an individualized case over that. A class action is a viable option to hold the corporation to account.",
      "That makes sense, thanks for the context. Though, I\u2019ve been a part of maybe 10 class actions in my life so far, and all of them amounted to less than $50 each. I suppose they are more effectively punitive to the corp than compensatory to the aggrieved.",

Some kind of unfavorable precedent is extreme tail risk because no matter what you're almost certainly going to settle, that isn't really a factor in legal department decisions. But real civil discovery is an extremely lengthy and expensive process.",

This provision does not make reference to the first time you accepted a version of these terms with an arbitration clause, or a similar phrase that would obviate the need for a new opt-out.On the plus side, if you didn\u2019t opt out before, you get a new opportunity to opt out, which according to the new terms will remove all disputes that have not yet been filed from the scope of previous arbitration agreements with Discord.Since the clause only applies if you are a US resident, it\u2019s very unclear how that opt-out deadline applies to existing Discord accounts for people who relocate into the US after the deadline.

But I'm on Android, so there's not really only one 'file system' with a search interface.My thought here is it that the app is going to be saving simple text files either plaintext or richtext (markdown/html), so it should be able to provide this for you, but I haven't even considered that as a feature so I would want to test it to see if there were any rough edges to polish.

Shannon's writing is remarkably lucid and transparent. The jargon is minimal, and his exposition is fantastic.As many other commentators has mentioned, it is impressive that such an approachable paper would lay the foundations for a whole field. I actually find that many subsequent textbooks seem to obfuscate the simplicity of the idea of entropy.Two examples from the paper really stuck with me. In one, he discusses the importance of spaces for encoding language, something which I had never really considered before. In the second, he discusses how it is the redundancy of language that allows for crosswords, and that a less redundant language would make it harder to design these (unless we started making them 3D!).

      "I'm all for moving to higher-level skills, when I was an adjunct professor I usually didn't put a huge emphasis on syntax unless I thought it was important to explain a concept, and I very rarely took off points for syntax.That said, I don't know that I would allow AI for learning to code in the class.  I do not consider \"prompt engineering\" to be a substitute for programming, and it's very easy to get AI to write some code and copypaste it, not understand anything it said, and be done.Last year, when I was administering a test, I said that they were allowed to use any IDE they wanted, but they could not use any AI assistance.  I am pretty convinced one student just copypasted my test questions into ChatGPT or BingAI and then copied the answers. I didn't have a way to prove it so I had to give him the benefit of the doubt and grade it assuming he did it honestly.Before someone says \"YOU SHOULD TEACH THEM TO USE THE AI TOOLS LOL THAT'S THE FUTURE!!!\", stop.  That's not true, not yet at least.  Just because I can call an Uber doesn't mean I get to say I know how to drive.  Just because I can go to McDonalds doesn't mean I get to say I know how to cook. I was teaching them how to write Java and Python, the goal of the class was for them to learn Java and Python, it wasn't learning how to copypaste into OpenAI.",
      "I'd say that especially because assistants are not good enough yet, it makes sense to allow students to use them. LLMs will produce output that is messed up, students will spend time figuring out how to fix that and learn the language grammar this way.I recently learned Swift & Metal this way - knowing Python and other languages, I kept pasting my pseudo-code, asking GPT to convert it into Metal/Swift, and then iterating on that. Took me a week or two to get the language without reaching for any sort of manual/tutorial. Speaking from experience - it would take me 2-4x as much time to learn the same thing otherwise.If GPT was any better, I'd have no need to fix the code, and I wouldn't learn as much.",

I even encouraged my students to use it outside of class if they needed help with any of the theory.I use ChatGPT all the time for learning new stuff, but a) I already know how to program well enough to teach a class on it, and b) it's a supplement to doing stuff on my own, without AI help.  I don't feel I learn that much from just copying and pasting.Totally agree with your process though; correcting and arguing with ChatGPT is an insanely good way to learn stuff.  It's really helped me get better at TLA+ and Isabelle proofs.",

      "Nuclear actually is safe by pure incident metrics, even when counting higher casualty estimates for Chernobyl.The safety, of course, is not intrinsic: nuclear material is obviously very dangerous, especially in a running reactor.The safety record stems from the considerable regulation around building and operating these reactors, and the fact that the reactor has so little external surface area once running:* A very small fuel acquisition operation in comparison to fossil fuels.* Likewise, no externally released pollution outside of accidents, which is rare.* sites chosen for construction are picked for their stability, and are heavily engineered, meaning you also don\u2019t have the \ninstallation worksite deaths which run up numbers for wind and solar.But again, this is only realized if the operational safety onsite is maintained. That said, it\u2019s not the only dangerous power generation site: dammed hydroelectric can be a considerable danger depending on what is downstream.In general, I think nuclear would be very popular if natural gas and solar were not available; however, the costs to keep it safe are too high for it to be economical compared to those two sources.",
      "Generally I consider nuclear to be an incredible potential, hugely capable.But civilizationally I don't see us as being able to keep doing the right thing with it. If windmills mess up and come crashing down in 20 years, there's negative impact, but locally and short term. If nuclear waste of contaminated decommissioned sites have a particularly bad day in 300 years, it could cause massive long term widescale problems for potentially centuries.I want this to be something that governments get behind and do, want it to be a high priority that we put beyond the whims of the market. I want better realistic views of pricing in & maintaining the very very very long lived negative externalities. I want intense research in what makes good long term sense, what's sustainable.Nuclear has so much potential, is so compelling to me. But I do not see a species organized or driven enough to meet with the very long lived complexities and challenges, do not see the appetite to do the job extremely well. We are very safe about it, but ultimately our scope is short cheap reactors, not doing nuclear in a big lasting fashion, at scale to justify figuring out systematically.Breeder reactors remain this fancy expensive thing we once did, but don't do again. Cancellation of Integral Fast Reactor & failure to make a PRISM derivative is a really sad failure to mature; here we had a much cheaper safer proloferation-safe way to care for the whole nuclear lifecycle, and we never could muster the try, to see how we might do better. What few reactors that are getting built tend towards unambitious fuel-inefficient simple designs, that saddle us with long term problems.Edit: -2? What nonsense. Say something! I spent the effort to lay out a view & case, have some decency, downvote-squad; contribute back.",
      "The thing linked to doesn't show it not to be true. It gives point estimates of 0.03 deaths per TWh for nuclear and 0.02 deaths per TWh for solar (and higher figures for everything else) and says \"the uncertainties around these values mean they are likely to overlap\".So it indeed doesn't show that \"nuclear is the safest\" is true, and if forced to guess on the basis of the numbers there you'd do best to guess that actually it's second-safest after solar, but it also doesn't show that \"nuclear is the safest\" is false\" and a more accurate description would be \"wind, nuclear and solar are all comparable to one another, and all much much much safer than any fossil fuels, there probably isn't that much difference between them, and we don't really have the data to tell what order they should go in\".(Some slightly more concrete numbers: total electricity generation of the US is about 4000 TWh, so those figures suggest an average of about 120 deaths per year if that were all nuclear and about 90 deaths per year if it were all solar. For comparison, according to https://www.statista.com/chart/6024/causes-of-death-in-the-u... these are on the same order of magnitude as \"deaths by lawnmower\" and \"deaths by autoerotic asphyxiation\".)It would probably have been better to say something like \"the safest, along with solar and wind power\". But everything we know is perfectly compatible with nuclear in fact being the safest, or the second safest, or the third safest.",
      "You are right, th link shows that nuclear is the safest right after solar, if you count dead/Terawatt-hour.  0.03 for nuclear and 0.02 for solar.Solar is still very small (and intermittent) when it comes to production, for instance, less than 2% for US (source:  https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/sites/flowcharts/files/2023-10/U...).

Anyone who is a potential customer for a lathe has SOME experience, even if it's just enough to say \"I want a lathe\" and the amount of effort they will need to go through to onboard to using the lathe properly is directly proportional to the applicable mental models they have for similar tasks. This probably involves hand eye coordination and gestures along with physics and a bunch of other things to onboard quickly.Intuition is about using the most fundamental mental models that your customer(s) should have and simplifying the connection of those to the new task.So intuition is contextual. The main goal is to save the user time. The narrow goal is to make the product easier to learn compared to your competitors. The big problem is no matter WHAT you do, the mental model a user will use when they approach a new task for the first time is inevitably different than the one you did.Or, \"You are not your customer\" or however you want to phrase it.",

The two that immediately come to mind are lathes and table saws.",
      "I said it elsewhere, but one of the first things I learned about power tools, from my father, is that if you don't know how to use a tool or tool setting, you don't use it.Granted, power drills are moderately benign as these things go, but you can do a lot of damage to a work piece really fast if you select a tool or setting you're unfamiliar with. Which is why there manuals, books, videos, and classes to teach you.Blogging about discoverability in the context of power tool interfaces is just peak software engineer naval gazing.",

      "A lot of software doesn't really follow the business/consumer model though, and is either outright public infrastructure or de-facto public infrastructure. Something like train ticket machines are a good example \u2013 I don't know what the current situation is because I haven't been there in years, but for a long time the train ticket machines on the Dutch/German border were a completely unusable mess of confusion. How can you mess something like this up so badly? I don't know, but they did. And then there are things like tax services, e-identity services, and all of that, much of which is far more complex, and easier to screw up.De-facto public infrastructure are things like banking, energy companies, stuff like that. \"Public infrastructure\" is perhaps not entirely the right term for this, but it is something more or less anyone is expected to be able to use, and where competition is often limited (or sometimes even non-existent).Remember the UK Post Office scandal? While I strongly feel the main cause was not the software[1], one reason the cunts in charge manage to gaslight people for so long was because the software is so complex, difficult, and does suck.[1]: Previous: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39013418",

      "Kind of a tough read, felt a bit like dancing around a point or not quite getting to one. It seems like the author learned how to use a power drill recently then quizzed a random chat on how they work (something he didn't know 5 mins before), then concluded that the UX is not good based on those results. Might be just the wrong audience, both the author and those in the chatroom might not be the target customer of the power drill, and whoever the target customer is might prefer clear numbers on a dial like that - probably because of paradigms set forth in power tools.I consider it similar to an audio engineer staring at a complex screen of panels, dials, scales - to a random person it wouldn't be intuitive at all, but to the target customer that's exactly how they are surfacing the important parts of their work to a control space.By the way - the author ultimately did figure out how to use the drill, can't help but wonder if anyone in the chat had to use a drill for some reason, they would simply watch the same video and easily figure it out too - or more likely just turn it, see the difference and be like \"Ah ok\" without even understanding what torque is.Article could use an ending or something definitive - this piece wants to be more insightful. Maybe a few more visuals to keep the reader close to the author's train of thought."

      "This research is all beyond me so maybe someone can explain: How does this compare to the state of the art in using simulators to train physical robots? Does using transformers help in any way or can this just as easily be done with other architectures?To the uninitiated this looks cool as all heck and yet another step towards the Star Trek future where we do everything in a simulator first and it always kinda just works in the real world (plot requirements notwithstanding).Although I can also hear the distant sounds of a hundred military R&D labs booting up Metalhead [1] simulators.Edit: Looks like the previous SOTA was still a manual process where the user had to come up with a reward function that actually rewards the actions they wanted to the algorithm to learn. This research uses language models to do that tedious step instead.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalhead_(Black_Mirror)",
      "Your edit is roughly correct. It's a bit odd that they're comparing a single human-made policy with the very best of the DrEureka outputs; in practice, I would expect to make multiple different reward functions and then do validation on the functions and hyperparameters based on the resulting trained models. However, their comparison isn't necessarily wrong, since it seems (I could be wrong) that they used the reward function from prior papers in the field of policy learning.If you're interested in methods for actually learning policies for these sorts of dynamic motions, note that this paper is simply applying proximal-policy optimization. They're pulling in the training and implementation methods from Margolis's [1] and Shan's [2] work.So, in sum, the contribution of this paper is exclusively the method for generating reward functions (which is still pretty cool!!!!!), not all the learning-based policy stuff.[1]: https://web.archive.org/web/20220703005502id_/http://www.rob...\n[2]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06440",
      "So the robot dog that's going to kill me in the near future will atleast be adorably balancing on a big rubber ball",
      "Death by giant rubber ball.In a scene reminiscent of the giant boulder rolling after Indiana Jones, a robot dog is balancing on top of an enormous rubber ball down the streets of some big city, flattening everything in its way.Cronch, cronch, cronch, go the cars.Squish, squish, squish, go the people.",

      "Kind of like how a human visualizes before a sport.?Like visualizing free throws in basketball, makes you measurably better, without actually doing free throws for real?",
      "Every single second of every example has a handler holding a leash - and not just holding it, holding it without any slack.Blindingly obvious interference from Ouija board effect.I don't mean to denigrate the work, I believe the researchers are honest and I hope there's demoes outside the published one. Just, at best, an obvious unforced error that leaves open a big question.EDIT: Replier below shared a gif with failures, tl;dr this looks like two different experiment protocols, one for success, one for failure. https://imgur.com/a/DmepBVU",
      "This sample on Twitter shows how other controllers fail:https://twitter.com/JasonMa2020/status/1786433841613390023I agree it's hard to tell whether the controller learned with DrEureka would be sufficient without the leash, but I'm at least convinced that the leash is not sufficient to hold a robot on the ball without a decently competent controller.",
      "Oh my, that looks quite damning. https://imgur.com/a/DmepBVUThe good case leash is held taught at half the distance of failures, at a parallel angle to the bot and orthogonal to failures.The failures all held with slack, on a leash held at 2x the distance of successes, at an angle orthogonal to the bot.(do correct me, we're seeing opposite things, and those are very small and I last took physics...16 years ago :< )",
      "Hmm, I do see what you mean."

    "first_paragraph": "Transferring policies learned in simulation to the real world is a promising strategy for acquiring robot skills at scale. However, sim-to-real approaches typically rely on manual design and tuning of the task reward function as well as the simulation physics parameters, rendering the process slow and human-labor intensive. In this paper, we investigate using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and accelerate sim-to-real design. Our LLM-guided sim-to-real approach requires only the physics simulation for the target task and automatically constructs suitable reward functions and domain randomization distributions to support real-world transfer. We first demonstrate our approach can discover sim-to-real configurations that are competitive with existing human-designed ones on \\rebuttal{quadruped locomotion and dexterous manipulation tasks}. Then, we showcase that our approach is capable of solving novel robot tasks, such as quadruped balancing and walking atop a yoga ball, without it",
    "summary": "In their latest scatterbrained escapade, self-professed saviors at eureka-research.github.io unveil <em>DrEureka</em>: because mankind's ultimate destiny clearly dictates that we teach metallic quadrupeds ballet atop yoga balls. This miraculous system apparently gifts AI with the profound intuition to automate and fine-tune the \u2018magic\u2019 behind simulating gravity and rewards, all while humans sip coffee and pretend they\u2019re outsmarting nature. Now robots can \u2018learn\u2019 to dance and prance through *Large Language Models*, because if you can't teach an old dog new tricks physically, best make it virtual. Mortals in the comments section wrestle with their existential dread, toggling between awe and the humorous terror of a SkyNet future powered by the next generation of robo-pets pirouetting into the apocalypse. Cue the distant hum of a hundred defense labs rebooting for a 'DrEureka: Skynet Edition' \u2013 how quaint! \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udc83"
