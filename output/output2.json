Regardless, it's good to see this sort of industry cooperation from companies who would normally be at each other's throats.",

Going forward to 2013 iPhones you have the 5s which was last supported in iOS 12. It sounds like Google is able to ship this directly rather than as an OS update that would need to go through manufacturers, while Apple typically deploys these type of fixes by pushing an OS update.

It could be me I suppose; judge for yourself:The first half suggests Chamberlain (\"SQL co-creator\") supports NoSQL which avoids the relational model and in many cases is oriented around more of a key-value store with eventual consistency for better handling certain scalability use cases. Slightly eyebrow-raising that the SQL co-creator agrees, but I don't think there's a huge technical dispute that you can scale better if you allow eventual consistency. Whether it's wise is debatable but of course there will always be a use case where it is arguably wise.The second half talks about SQL++ which AWS calls PartiQL whose value proposition is better/easier parsing of JSON.I am not clear how relaxing ACID properties to scale is related to JSON other than that a bunch of early NoSQL databases tried to do both.I am no PartiQL/SQL++ expert but I have used it and it is pretty much SELECT... FROM... etc SQL with some fancy features for JSON handling. With standard transactional semantics.  You can do similar JSON-type handling in Postgres and Snowflake and other tooling from what I can tell, although I'd be a bit surprised if some of the SQL++/PartiQL dot notation and array subscripting for working with JSON data is ANSI SQL standardized.",

The query languages I've seen are imperative, which encourages and processing after the fetch on the client.And since it encourages \"winging\" it, the DBs tend to be poorly structured/documented.

      "Most of the time yes, HPC systems are shared among many users. Sometimes though the whole system (or near it) will be used in a single run. These are sometimes referred to as \"hero runs\" and while they're more common for benchmarking and burn-ins there are some tightly-coupled workloads that perform well in that style of execution. It really depends on a number of factors like the workloads being run, the number of users, and what the primary business purpose of the HPC resource is. Sites that have to run both types of jobs will typically allow any user to schedule jobs most of the time but then pre-reserve blocks of time for hero runs to take place where other user jobs are held until the primary scheduled run is over.",
      "You are generally correct, however there are workloads that do use larger portions of a supercomputer that wouldn't be feasible on smaller systems.Also, I guess I'm not sure what you mean by \"smaller systems that focus more on power/cost/space\". A proper queueing system generally efficiently allocates the resources of a large supercomputer to smaller tasks, while also making larger tasks possible in the first place. And I imagine there's somewhat an efficiency of scale in a large installation like this.There are, of course, many many smaller supercomputers, such as at most medium to large universities. But even those often have 10-50k cores or so.(In general, efficiency is a consideration when building/running, but not of using. Scientists want the most computational power they can get, power usage be damned :) )edit: A related topic is capacity vs. capability: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer#Capability_versu...",
      "> my understanding correctYes> why is it important to build supercomputers with more and more computeA mix of- research in distributed systems (there are plenty of open questions in Concurrency, Parallelization, Computer Architecture, etc)- a way to maintain an ecosystem of large vendors (Intel, AMD, Nvidia and plenty of smaller vendors all get a piece of the pie to subsidize R&D)- some problems are EXTREMELY computationally and financially expensive, so they require large On-Prem compute capabilities (eg. Protein folding, machine learning when I was in undergrad [DGX-100s were subsidized by Aurora], etc)- some problems are extremely sensitive for national security reasons and it's best to keep all personnel in a single region (eg. Nuclear simulations, turbine simulations, some niche ML work, etc)In reality you need to do both, and planners know this fact, and have known this fact for decades",
      "Bigger systems when utilized at 100% are more efficient than multiple smaller systems when utilized at 100%, in terms of engineering work, software, etc.But also, bigger systems have more opportunities to achieve higher utilization than smaller systems due to the dynamics of bin packing problem.",
      "While in general there can be many smaller workloads running in parallel. However, periodically the whole supercomputer can be reserved for a \"hero\" run.",

Can you link to an example of that?I don't mean speech to text to LLM to text to speech. I mean speech-to-speech directly, as in the ML model takes audio as input and outputs audio. As they have now in OpenAI.I am very familiar with the typical multi-model workflow and have implemented it several times.",
      "An audio-to-audio model is definitely a step forward. And I do think that's where things are going to go, generally speaking.For context relating to real-time voice AI: once you're down below ~800ms things are fast enough to feel naturally responsive for most people and use cases.The GPT-4o announcement page says they average ~320ms time to first token from an audio prompt. Which is definitely next level and is really, really exciting. You can't get to 800ms with any pipeline that includes GPT-4 Turbo today, so this is a big deal.It's possible to do ~500ms time to first token by pipelining today's fastest transcription, inference, and tts models. (For example, Deepgram transcription, Groq Llama-3, Deepgram Aura voices.)",

And I have no personal experience with Alexa, so I can't speak to it. But I do have a few Google Home speakers and an Android phone, and I have seen no major improvements in years. In fact, it has gotten worse - for example, you can no longer add items directly to AnyList[0], only Google Keep.Or, as an incredibly simple example of something I thought we'd get a long time ago, it's still unable to interpret two-part requests, e.g. \"please repeat that but louder,\" or \"please turn off the kitchen and dining room lights.\"I find voice assistants very useful - especially when driving, lying in bed, cooking, or when I'm otherwise preoccupied.

      "I have a single code base [0] for the self-hosted editions and for the SaaS. I split features up across two editions: community edition (CE) and enterprise edition (EE), and then also two modes: singleplayer and multiplayer (single- vs multi-tenant). The switching is done via environment variables, KEYGEN_EDITION and KEYGEN_MODE. The SaaS offering actually runs the EE edition in multiplayer mode, and is right now the only instance of the EE edition in multiplayer mode (other EE customers are entitled to singleplayer only).I've been running this set up for about a year [1] and it's working well. Having a single code base was a requirement before I made the project fair source [2]; the fair source ELv2 license lets me add feature gates to facilitate this, while protecting me from forks giving away EE features for free (while still allowing forks).Updates are pushed to the SaaS offering daily. I cut self-hosted releases bi-annually unless it's for a critical fix.[0]: https://github.com/keygen-sh/keygen-api[1]: https://keygen.sh/blog/all-your-licensing-are-belong-to-you/[2]: http://fair.io/",

So main repo was the OSS version (with it's own main), and the git submodule was a different program entrypoint that contained / activated the enterprise code. So devs would have both the OSS/Enterprise module checked out and could work on both together.In this example as I recall most of the enterprise code was just activation code, so a properly motivated individual could probably figure out how to turn on some of the enterprise features, but most people won't bother to figure out how to do their own builds, and it's more work then finding the secret env variables in an open repo.It's a little bit painful at times because changes that cover both code bases need two commits, and it isn't uncommon for someone to forget or commit the wrong submodule pointer.

      "If I understand this is more of a coding question.  I'd argue it would be best for most web based SaaS to have a single codebase, with a single branch that represents the production site. That code base would then be smart enough to enable the right features based on the current user and/or tenant and their subscription level and payment status.  Pseudocode:   public DoFoo(){\n      if(CurrentUser.IsFreeSku && CurrentUser.FoosThisMonth >= 10) return Error('Free users are only allowed to do 10 foos each month);\n      FooService.DoFoo();\n      CurrentUser.FoosThisMonth ++ \n   }\n\nSimilar in the UI you may hide or show things based on the current user/tenant and their sub level.<div class='hidden-paid-user'>Click here to get our paid service</div>You would still have server code enforce the subscription level rules because a malicious user could circumvent any client-based rules.

Basically the only problem we couldn't solve 20 years ago was excessive ringing (which is why softer scaling algorithms were preferred). You can put quite a lot of effort into getting clearer edges, especially for thin lines, but for most content you can't expect too much more sharpness than what the basic methods get you.And then there is the generative approach where you just make stuff up. It's quite effective but a bit iffy.

    "summary": "At the-tls.co.uk, a critic embarks on an inspired journey to assert the colossal importance of Surrealism, discovering along the way that not only is the art movement still marginally relevant, but that you can use a lot of fancy words and still say very little. Online scholarly types <em>furiously</em> peck at their keyboards in the comments section, debating whether Dali\u2019s mustache was an artistic statement or just a facial hair catastrophe. One erudite commenter brings up Foucault and then another weighs in with nothing but an emoji sequence; a true discourse for the ages. Somewhere, a surrealist laughs in their grave, or just paints another melting clock."

      "I've exchanged a couple of emails with the author a while ago. Reverse-engineering and decompiling DOS software running in real mode and especially video games is a particularly tricky endeavor, a notch above other similar projects on other platforms.The combination of janky PC hardware, paper-thin MS-DOS operating system and prehistoric development tooling makes for an environment where anything goes. Real mode segmented memory and large memory models utterly confuse Ghidra's analyzers and decompiler, most common modern reverse-engineering tools either do not support 16-bit MS-DOS executables or have third-rate support.It is more art than science in a way that I don't think reverse-engineering later software can match.",
      "It's a little awful to think about just how much collective human effort was wasted by segmented memory. Everyone knew that 32-bit flat memory was the future; it just took a long time for the PC platform to get there.",
      "Wow... bookmarked. F-15 Strike Eagle II is one of those games I played the hell out of as a child. So much so I wore out two joysticks that my parents bought as a result.I was a child so it took me a long time to learn to actually do what the game wanted, and then learn after taking out the targets you got more medals by then bombing or strafing other targets. I don't think I ever got the hang of landing back on the aircraft carrier though.",
      "That was my experience with it, too. Microprose could do no wrong.",
      "I owned multiple Microprose games and the manuals that came with the games were simply fantastic.There would be a section on the gameplay itself and then usually some historical reference about the setting of the game. E.g. if it was a WW1 flight combat simulator, there would be a section on the history of aerial dogfighting and then specs on each plane.I know that nowadays it's common knowledge that most people don't read the manuals and it's easier to get people into a game with a combination first level /introduction/tutorial. That being said, I feel like we lost something by taking out the manuals with all that rich historical detail.",
      "Knights of the Sky was that WW1 flight combat game. Also a wonderful chunk of my childhood went into that. Although I found SEII to be more fun.",
      "When I was about 8 years old I can remember walking into the office at home this game was on the screen. One of the fighters was flying towards an airstrip and I thought I'd helpfully land it, I crashed. Turns out dad had it on autopilot to return to home after some mission which he had to repeat thanks to me :)",
      "I never played that one, but the Microprose \"look\" just leapt out at me from those screenshots (similarities with F-19, Gunship 2000 etc etc).I did play the later Janes F-15E sim - much more complicated/harder than the Microprose ones were. Not sure it was more fun though, lots more study needed and probably needed proper stick and pedals etc to get much out of it.",

      "> GPUs (7) are the common choice of hardware for training large language models. However, there is a global shortage of GPUs due to the large investment from many countries to train LLMs. Under such circumstances, it is important to show that large language models can be trained using Fugaku, which uses CPUs instead of GPUs. The CPUs used in Fugaku are Japanese CPUs manufactured by Fujitsu, and play an important role in terms of revitalizing Japanese semiconductor technology.",
      "ARM CPUs, specifically. Fairly unusual in the Top500 list.",
      "For those curious about Fugaku, it\u2019s currently the 4th fastest supercomputer in the TOP500 list: https://www.top500.org/system/179807/",
      "Does anyone know how this model compares to GPT-4 for Japanese output? Taking a look at GPT-4o today, the Japanese example in the landing page feels unnatural and represents a huge regression from the quality I would expect of GPT-4.With that said, both GPT-4 and GPT-4o seem to do a good job at understanding the semantics of prompts written in Japanese. I would like to see how this model compares, given that it seems like it's trained with more Japanese data (but that may not necessarily be useful if all they did was scrape affiliate blogs)",
      "I\u2019ve gotten very good results with Japanese output in GPT-4 but it takes a little work.",
