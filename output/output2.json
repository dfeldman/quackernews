      "Pretty impressive. The engineering team at SpaceX is really something. Some thoughts;The 'chopsticks catch' was amazing to watch. Seems like it adds a lot of risk and clearly the booster needs additional fire suppression systems :-) perhaps the tower could mount something that sprays the booster like the barges have for the F9 boosters.The heatshield held out for a much longer time, the asymmetric heating on the flaps was interesting. I had guessed that all four flaps would have equivalent heating based on an approach that was basically that side of the rocket perpendicular to the flow but it seems like that isn't the case. Still it seems like they are close to having something workable here.The detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure. Engineering it to be strong enough to land on water would presumably compromise the cargo to orbit number.The use of Starlink was really interesting. The ability to get live video for the entire re-entry is pretty game changing for engineering. I'd guess there are even more 'views' than they showed (there would be if I were running things :-)) but overall that capability is something that really helps evaluate the changes made.I can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage. That would enable, perhaps, one of their 'massive' Starlink missions to test cargo delivery. It will also start to give us some better numbers on exactly how much cargo Starship can put in orbit in 'full reuse' mode  which is essential if they want to create a fueling station on orbit for the Artemis program.Again, hats off to engineering at SpaceX, y'all did good.\n \nreply",
      "Seems like it adds a lot of riskI'm actually wondering about that.  If I understand correctly, the arms can move up and down, and pivot around the tower.  This allows them to correct for some error in the rocket trajectory and also (presumably) \"soften\" the final contact.  Between the nozzles and the arms, it gives SpaceX a lot of degrees of freedom in the final seconds (you can see how the booster kind of \"hovered\" right at the end) and in certain respects might even offer more forgiveness than the hard ground.Could it smash into the tower?  For sure.  Would that be more dangerous than smashing into the pad?  I don't know.It's a new technique with which we don't have a lot of experience.\n \nreply",
      "It helps enormously that unlike Falcon-9 this rocket can dial down the thrust of its engines low enough to be able to actually hover or to move arbitrarily slowly in the final meters before touchdown.It can arrive to the designated intermediate point with some already good accuracy, and then take some time to trim the remaining errors to the noise level more slowly, possibly with feedback from the ground sensors.The chopsticks also include rails with shock absorbers, the action of which can be seen in the view from the tower during the landing [1], so the required accuracy is probably relatively modest, provided one plans the maneuver carefully.[1] https://youtu.be/Ysx4t7ICO58?t=678\n \nreply",
      "The main takeaway from Scott's commentary is that the chopsticks allow the ommission of landing legs and all their subsequent systems and saves a ton of weight. The added risk to dial this technique in is likely worth it in the long run from a sustainability stand point.\n \nreply",
      "To me, it's not risk reduction that they're after with that booster catching mechanism, but weight reduction. Those landing legs that we've seen before (and the mechanism related to them) are costly weight that is absolutely necessary only on the rocket itself, because that is expected to land on its own somewhere on a bare rock. For booster however, it makes sense to have as much of such launch and landing weights externalized, considering booster's reduced use-case of starting from a spaceport and very soon ending up back there too.\n \nreply",
      "The way the trajectory is designed is that it has to scoot over to the tower at the last second, and it only does that if it's really really sure it can make it, otherwise it crashes off to the side.\n \nreply",
      "My thought (admittedly not well developed) is that smashing into a landing pad of concrete can damage that pad but it can be quickly repaired without affecting the ability to launch future rockets. If you damage the launch tower significantly you're going to have to suspend launches from it until you fix it. So the \"higher risk\" is more critical assets offline in the event of a non-optimal return.\n \nreply",
      "Understood, although weren't they out of commission for a really long time anyway the last time they damaged their launchpad?\n \nreply",
      "> The detonation at the end was pretty spectacular too, but I suspect that structurally the tanks failed as the rocket hit the water vs anything that was an engineering failure.It's possible that SpaceX programed the AFTS to trigger some time after the rocket touched down in the water. Just to make sure that it completely submerges quickly.> I can easily imagine that flight 6 will be nominal end to end without any unintended damage.I think it depends on what you mean by \"nominal\". SpaceX ultimately wants to catch the 2nd stage as well. I suspect that they are a ways off of that, since it would have to approach over land. The FAA is going to need to have very high confidence that it will do exactly what it's designed to do before they're going to allow that.\n \nreply",
      "> Just to make sure that it completely submerges quickly.Why would they want to do that? (genuinly curious).I reckon there would be a lot of useful data left if they could recover or even just inspect the remains. The remains are one big tank, so it would have floated.\n \nreply"

      "This is a really interesting design, but these kinds of smart systems always inhabit an uncanny valley for me. You need them in exactly two cases:1. You have a really high-load system that you need to figure out some clever ways to scale.2. You're working on a toy project for fun.If #2, fine, use whatever you want, it's great.If this is production, or for Work(TM), you need something proven. If you don't know you need this, you don't need it, go with a boring Postgres database and a VM or something.If you do know you need this, then you're kind of in a bind: It's not really very mature yet, as it's pretty new, and you're probably going to hit a bunch of weird edge cases, which you probably don't really want to have to debug or live with.So, who are these systems for, in the end? They're so niche that they can't easily mature and be used by lots of serious players, and they're too complex with too many tradeoffs to be used by 99.9% of companies.The only people I know for sure are the target market for this sort of thing is the developers who see something shiny, build a company (or, worse, build someone else's company) on it, and then regret it pretty soon and move to something else (hopefully much more boring).Does anyone have more insight on this? I'd love to know.\n \nreply",
      "Databases is an extremely slow-maturing area, similar to programming languages, but are all deviations from Postgres shiny and hipster?The idea of colocating data and behavior is really a quantifiable reduction in complexity. It removes latency and bandwidth concerns, which means both operational concerns and development concerns (famously the impact of the N+1 problem is greatly reduced). You can absolutely argue that networked Postgres is better for other reasons (and you may be right) but SQLite is about as boring and predictable as you can get, with known strong advantages. This is the reason it\u2019s getting popular on the server.That said, I don\u2019t like the idea of creating many small databases very much - as they suggest with Durable Objects. That gives noSQL nightmares - breaking all kinds of important invariants of relational dbs. I think it\u2019s much preferable to use SQLite as a monolithic database like it\u2019s done in their D1 product.\n \nreply",
      "As far as I can tell, multiplayer is the killer app for Durable Objects. If you want to build another Figma, Google Docs, etc, the programming model of Durable Objects is super handy.This article goes into it more: https://digest.browsertech.com/archive/browsertech-digest-cl...I think this old article is quite relevant too: http://ithare.com/scaling-stateful-objects/Anyone who read the Figma multiplayer article and thought \"that's kind of what I need\" would be well served by Durable Objects, I think. https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/There are other approaches - I've worked in the past with CRDTs over WebRTC which felt absolutely space-age. But that's a much more complicated foundation compared to a websocket and a single class instance \"somewhere\" in the cloud.\n \nreply",
      "That's a very interesting use case. Given that your \"players\" aren't guaranteed to be local to the DO, doesn't using DOs only make sense in high-traffic situations again? Otherwise you might as well just serve the players from a conventional server, no?CRDTs really do sound amazing, though.\n \nreply",
      "In practice you\u2019re most likely to be collaborating with other folks on your school project group, work team, close family, etc. Sure there are exceptions, but generally speaking picking a service location near your first group member ensures low latency for them (and they\u2019re probably most engaged), and is likely to have lowish latency for everyone else.On the flip side, picking US-East-1 gives okayish latency to folks near that, and nobody else.\n \nreply",
      "I'd view the split here along the axes of debuggability/introspection.There are many services that just don't require performance tuning or deep introspection, things like internal tools. This is where I think serverless frameworks do well, because they avoid a lot of time spent on deployment. It's nice if these are fast, but that's rarely a key requirement. Usually the key requirement is that they are fast to build and low maintenance. It's possible that Cloudflare have got a good story for developer experience here that gets things working quickly, but that's not their pitch, and there are a lot of services competing to make this sort of development fast.However where I don't think these services work well is when you have high debuggability and introspection requirements. What metrics do I get out of this? What happens if some Durable Objects are just slow, do we have the information to understand why? Can we rectify it if they are? What's the logging story, and how much does it cost?I think these sorts of services may be a good idea for a startup on day 1 to build some clever distributed system in order to put off thinking about scaling, but I can't help but think that scale-up sized companies would be wanting to move off this onto something they can get into the details more with, and that transition would be a hard one.\n \nreply",
      "If you're in #1, you talk to CloudFlare. They need some great customer stories and they have some great engineers that are most likely willing to work with you on how this will work/help you with bugs in exchange for some success stories. If it gets proven out this turns into a service relationship, but early on it's a partnership.\n \nreply",
      "I almost have the opposite view:When starting out you can get away with using a simple Postgres database. Postgres is fine for low-traffic projects with minimal latency constraints, and you probably want to spend your innovation tokens elsewhere.But in very high-traffic Production cases with tight latency requirements, you will start to see all kinds of weird and wacky traffic patterns, that barebones Postgres won't be able to handle. It's usually in these cases where you'd need to start exploring alternatives to Postgres. It's also in these cases where you can afford to hire people to manage your special database needs.\n \nreply",
      "Have you worked on any examples of projects that started on PostgreSQL and ended up needing to migrate to something specialized?\n \nreply",
      "There are a lot of cases of low traffic applications that aren\u2019t toys but instead are internal tools- this could be a great option for those.For higher traffic they are asking you to figure out how to shard your data and it\u2019s compute. That\u2019s really hard to do without hitting edge cases.\n \nreply"

      "Same here; I've been fascinated by Lisp machines for the past decade, but they are very difficult to get a hold of, and when they do show up for sale, they are prohibitively expensive.  When I went to the now-defunct Living Computer Museum in Seattle back in 2019, I saw that there were no Lisp machines available, though I did get to see and use other rare machines such as the Xerox Alto, the Apple Lisa, and the original NeXT cube (I'm glad I finally got to add one to my collection a few years ago).  MIT CADR has been made open source for quite some time (https://tumbleweed.nu/lm-3/), and I'm glad that Xerox Interlisp-D is now open source (https://interlisp.org/).  However, the holy grail of Lisp machine environments, Symbolics Genera, is still not available as FOSS.  Funnily enough, this is fitting since Richard Stallman's frustrations with Symbolics was one of the catalysts behind his starting the GNU Project.One of the interesting \"what could have been\" moments of computing history is Apple's exploration of Lisp in the late 1980s and during the first half of the 1990s.  Such projects include:-  Apple's original plans for the Newton, which included an OS written in Lisp.-  The Dylan programming language, which I've heard can be thought of as Scheme with the Common Lisp Object System.  Dylan was originally designed to be the official language used to develop Newton apps.  Originally Dylan had an S-expression syntax, but this was changed to a more Algol-like syntax due to the prevailing opinion among many that an Algol-like syntax would be easier for C/Pascal/C++ programmers to adopt.  However, the Newton ended up using a C++-based operating system, and NewtonScript, which wasn't based on a Lisp, was created as the language for developing Newton apps.-  SK8 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK8_(programming_language) ), which was dubbed \"HyperCard on steroids,\" was written in Common Lisp.In an alternate timeline, we could've been using Apple devices built on a Lisp foundation.  This is probably the closest we've gotten to Lisp machines on the desktop, as opposed to specialized AI workstations that cost five figures in 1980s dollars.Then again, things worked out well for Apple after the NeXT purchase.  The OpenStep API (which became Cocoa) and Objective-C was (and still is) solid infrastructure than can be thought of as a \"pragmatic Smalltalk\" desktop, though in recent years I feel Apple has been moving on from NeXT influences and is doing its own thing now with Swift.\n \nreply",
      "> had an S-expression syntax, but this was changed to a more Algol-like syntax due to the prevailing opinion among many that an Algol-like syntax would be easier for C/Pascal/C++ programmers to adopt.They can be forgiven, at the time.  Now we have evidence that thinking is wrong.  Today we have half of everyone and their dog, as Web programmers, using a syntax originally chosen by very technical systems programmers. (Bell Labs researchers -> C -> Oak -> Java -> JavaScript.)Almost no Web developers are systems programmers, and this is just a poor syntax for the work, and needlessly cryptic, but they can pick up even this bad syntax just fine.Now we know that, whether you use curly braces, parentheses, whitespace, or something else is not the barrier to learning a programming language.  It's one of the most absolutely trivial things about it to learn.Knowing this, the next time I hear someone say \"We can't use this syntax, because it will just totally break people's brains, even though the higher grammar, semantics, libraries, domain frameworks, and everything else are different anyway, and are orders of magnitude harder to learn, we need to make it look superficially like something it's not, because people are full of poo\"...

Either way, that information is lost by the blocked leaf. And if the entire signal is not lost, perhaps many leaves may have blocked the signal but some signal managed to get through, it doesn't matter whether the signal change was a change in brightness, or a change in color.

Commenters, emboldened by half-remembered high school physics and mixed metaphors, dive headfirst into the deep end of overthinking.

And when we do this, something remarkable happens. Time, which so often feels like it is slipping through our fingers, begins to slow.doesn't really apply to me, or to many people I know and have worked with - it is when I focus on one task that \"time flies\", and it's distractions that end up throwing men out of the zone.\n \nreply",
      "What you're describing is a state of flow which is good for things like work but the article seems to be talking about time metaphorically.For example, imagine you're going to your daughter's piano recital and spend the whole time thinking about work. You would be missing out on the experience of watching her perform and grow. If you become mindful of these habits and say \"My mind is focusing on something that I cannot change right now, I should be present\" then you'll be able to fully experience a moment in your child's life. So rather than feeling like life is passing you by, you're able to experience it in the moment. The surrounding sentences of the line you quoted don't read like the author's describing time like you are:\"But in this process, we must remember something important: life is not meant to be rushed through. It is not a race, nor is it a problem to be solved. It is an experience to be lived, and living well requires presence. ... Moments become rich, textured. Even the simplest of tasks takes on a new significance when approached with care, with attention.\"\n \nreply",
      "Author describes experiences that myself can fully confirm. Everything said in this article resonates very strong, including how time slows in observation. This incredible essay is a very organic, honest summary, yet without all the esoteric, of what a mindful presence can be (whenever achieved). A bliss retold in few paragraphs.Indeed to let go of the worldly rush is truly liberating. What a pity it is not allowed to complement the scriptures with such insights.\n \nreply",
      "It is my experience that \"flow\" is not the same as \"mindfulness\" or \"attention\".\n \nreply",
      "agree that the \"clock of life\" is a strange beast, when compared to the clock on the wall. i try to quit paying too much attention to the latter, and time becomes more nuanced and textured.\n \nreply",
      "What I think he meant is that time slows down for him in the way that time around him speeds up while he can stay focused on one thing.Now of course I\u2019m not the author so I\u2019m not sure but yeah the way you\u2019re describing it (real time flying when you\u2019re locked in on something) is how I feel it goes for most people\n \nreply",
      "Yep that\u2019s my reading too.  I like to see it from a dynamical systems perspective:  as a system approaches an attractor, the phase flow slows down, while the wall time marches on steadily.  If we consider the \u201cperspective\u201d of the system, which is wall time divided by phase flow, we get the time speeding up part.\n \nreply",
      "Well put, but I think you\u2019re using \u201cfocus\u201d in a different sense than the author is.The article discusses internal (intensional!) focus on the substance of experience itself as it\u2019s presented to your unified Ego, and you\u2019re discussing the much more common idea of external (extensional!!1!) focus, which is almost the exact opposite since it typically requires quieting your inner monologue to the greatest extent possible and letting your subconscious faculties act autonomously.\n \nreply",
      "Yeah, it's more like time taking a backseat than slowing down.\n \nreply",
      "Stoicism explores these ideas. One of the basic premises is that all external events are out of our control and to focus on what is, basically what is in our mind and our actions. Then we should try to discipline our ideas around virtues which are always good instead of outcomes and externals. That summary doesn't do it justice, if interested in exploring further.

And it is then,\n      perhaps, that a subtle truth begins to\n      emerge: the only thing we truly possess,\n      the only thing we might, with enough\n      care, exert some mastery over, is our\n      mind. It is not a realization of\n      resignation, but rather of liberation.\n      For if the mind can be ordered, if it           can be made still in the midst of this\n      restless life, then we have already\n      discovered the key to a deeper kind of\n      freedom.But how does one begin? It is not with\n      grand declarations or bold, sweeping\n      changes. That would miss the point\n      entirely. Rather, it is with a gentle\n      attention to the present, a deliberate\n      shift in the way we move through the\n      world. We begin by paying attention to\n      what our mind ",
    "summary": "In another groundbreaking display of recycled philosophy, billwear.github.io astonishes the masses with the enlightening discovery that <em>paying attention</em> can actually change your life\u2014provided you hadn't figured that out by kindergarten. Between lyrical waxing about the mind's liberation and the profound ability to notice things, the commenters engage in a bewildering mix of confirming the obvious and misunderstanding the concept altogether. One user excitingly misinterprets focus as causing time dilation, while another helpfully suggests that, hey, this might just be Stoicism in a cheap disguise. As per usual, no one's mind was harmed (or utilized much) during this intellectual scrimmage."

Many properties of even simple objects, such as higher dimensional analogs of cubes and spheres, are very counterintuitive. Below we discuss just a few of these properties in an attempt to convey some of the weirdness of high dimensional space.You may be used to using the word \"circle\" in two dimensions and \"sphere\" in three dimensions. However, in higher dimensions we generally just use the word sphere, or \\(d\\)-sphere when the dimension of the sphere is not clear from context. With this terminology, a circle is also called a 1-sphere, for a 1-dimensional sphere. A standard sphere in three dimensions is called a 2-sphere, and so on. This sometimes causes confusion, because a \\(d\\)-sphere is usually thought of as existing in \\((d+1)\\)-dimensional space.

      "TIL about Kirkwood gaps.  I knew about Jupiter leading to Hilda and Trojan groupings, but my understanding of the main belt was more in line with a representation like this one from Wikipedia[1]. However, this imaging shows a clear gap and a quick search led me to learn about Kirkwood gaps.  Is there a specific reason why the gap is more evident in this imaging rather than the above one from Wikipedia?[1] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png[2] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap\n \nreply",
      "You should not be able to see the Kirkwood gaps if the simulation is accurate; the Wikipedia image is more realistic.The \"gap\" only applies to the semi-major axis (which is proportional to the 3/2th power of the period); since most asteroids are somewhat eccentric (and since semi-major axis is relative to the center but orbits are based on a focus, which \"moves\" rapidly as the circle deforms) there are always asteroids crossing the \"gap\" between perihelion (far short of the semi-minor axis, even) and aphelion (far beyond the semi-major axis).I'm too lazy to do the math, but based on planets with similar eccentricity, most asteroids are between 10% and 25% farther at aphelion than at perihelion (or, often between 0.25AU and 0.75AU farther), which easily crosses any single gap, and almost always multiple gaps.See the images at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity for informative images of ellipses.\n \nreply",
      "I suspect the gap is at least 50% rendering artifact, but all 1.4M asteroids are plotted as (small) fraction of its orbital ellipse, so the density distribution is reflective of the real data (more specifically, orbit types)\n \nreply",
      "If I understand both the code and o11c's comment correctly, it sounds like the difference is less rendering artifact rather than what is being rendered.  This code is rendering the asteroids based off their semi-major axis, but Wikipedia appears to be rendering their actual positions at a specific moment in time with the asteroids all at various points in their eccentric orbit.\n \nreply",

      "I thought this was going to be a bit of dry humor before I followed the link. It\u2019s actually serious, and fairly informative (albeit a bit scary).The first place I worked had a soft-but-hard rule (enforced by ridicule) that single-letter variable names not be used.  Loop counters like i, j, and k were frowned upon. However, counters like ii, jj, and kk were fine for matrix operations, xx and yy for image loops, etc.There were a couple of key guidelines to follow:1. If it can have more meaning than sample, pixel, or matrix position, give it more meaning, but two characters repeated is fine for loop counters (again, with meaning).2. Whatever you use should be quickly findable with text search tools of the era (the late \u201890\u2019s).Someone shouldn\u2019t have to use source inspection assistive coding tools to parse the code you write.  When someone else (or you, in a few months) comes upon this code and needs to understand it, they should be able to use find to do it.\n \nreply",

Why matrices?At work, we're rendering stylized maps, and we allow the user to have a fair amount of customization.

(He calls LF \"newline\". OK, fine, his reasoning seems legit.) He is not advocating changing the language of the standard.To all those people complaining that this is a minor matter and the wrong hill to die on, I say this: most programmers today are blindly depending on third-party libraries that are full of these kinds of workarounds for ancient, weird vestigial crud, so they might think this is an inconsequential thing. But if you're from the school of pure, simple code like the SQLite/Fossil/TCL developers, then you're writing the whole stack from scratch, and these things become very, very important.Let me ask you instead: why do you care if somebody doesn't comply with the standard?

      "I'm guessing that f32::clone showing up in the profile isn't actually a call to f32::clone, because you have optimizations on (if it actually is a call to a \"movd xmm0,dword ptr [rdi]; ret\" instruction pair, that's a bug in the compiler). Rather it's the result of the compiler choosing to attribute seemingly-random lines to f32::clone, because when lines from multiple functions are fused into one instruction the compiler will just pick one, and it happened to pick f32::clone to write into the debug info. You really want to look at instruction-level profiling when you're profiling at that level instead of the individual functions, since debug info is going to be very unreliable.\n \nreply",
      "I also see the profiling shows that the \"iter::next\" takes a large percentage in the flamegraph. Are they the same reason?\n \nreply",

      "I\u2019m a Rust newbie, wondering how f32::clone could show up in a profile. Wouldn\u2019t that be an inline no-op under any kind of optimization? I mean, cloning a float is, at worst, a MOV instruction, no?\n \nreply",

      "I don't understand why half of these aren't optimized by the compiler automatically. (x - y).norm_squared()? Why is f32::clone() not just an inline mov? Begging a lot of questions.\n \nreply"

      "How does a Jew discovering the Americas benefit the Spanish regime when the Spanish Catholic monarchy precisely kicked all Jews and Muslims from the peninsula with their ill-named \"reconquista\"? If this turns out to be true, then it'd be rather ironical.Presumably this Lorente has more evidence he hasn't put on display, so it isn't completely baseless either.It's certainly sketchy and not very scientific, though, per the same criticism outlined in the article.I also don't understand why people get a boner with Columbus. It is since the Greeks that people knew the world was not flat, and the vikings (presumably Leif Erikson) landed in Canada much earlier after a quick hop from Greeland. The only questions left at that point were: how big is that land over there, and can you get to India traveling West? It's all good and stuff, but not mind-blowing to me.\n \nreply",

      "I already posted below, but since you probably won't scroll down and I hate to see people get tricked: I would take this article with a massive grain of salt. Not \"definitely wrong\", but perhaps \"of very dubious origin, making unusually strong claims based on unpublished, inconsistently-described evidence\". For context, the \"Columbus was Jewish\" assertion is part of a broader \"Columbus was secretly Spanish/Catalonian\" fight they've been having for a while (which isn't surprising given the region's generally positive recollection of their \"glory days\" of genocide and slavery), as it's supposed to preclude him from being Italian.Besides that, as an American who spent a semester in Spain and took a class focused on religious diversity specifically on the peninsula: your analysis is definitely possible, but there was also plenty of Jewish people practicing in secret throughout the reconquista. Thus the inquisition, even! The Reconquista took hundreds of years and saw multiple waves of anti-Jewish laws throughout the various Christian kingdoms, from taxes to restrictions to the famous expulsions, so there was plenty of precedent to learn from.I'd be curious to hear from any actual experts on how the Spanish viewed national origin, and whether that played a significant role in religious persecution. AFAIK they welcomed converts with open arms (especially Muslim ones), which makes me even more dubious that Columbus would choose to repeatedly claim to be from Italy just to hide his Jewish ancestry. He was 100% verifiably a practicing Catholic, isn't that all that should have mattered to his peers? But I'm walking pretty blind here.\n \nreply",

      "When I worked on WiFi at Microsoft, we discovered that Apple was cheating.

      "I would guess that this aspect of the spec was not well tested.
